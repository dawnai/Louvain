The Secretary of State for Business and Trade and the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero are both, I think, due to attend similar discussions. I completely disagree with the noble Lord's characterisation of the Chancellor's visit to China. As I said, we must and will continue to engage with our international partners in trade and investment, and that includes engaging with China. \nWe cannot ignore the fact that China is the second-largest economy worldwide and our fourth-largest trading partner, with exports supporting close to half a million jobs in the UK. We need to help British businesses export around the world, and that includes to China. On human rights and the parliamentary sanctions that the noble Lord talks about, the Chancellor did raise those-absolutely-but she believes that, unless we open that"

The project will provide technical evaluations for the High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope, a large-scale scientific instrument proposed by IHEP with an expected volume of about 30 cubic kilometers.\nThe prototype detectors are part of HUNT's preparatory phase, which aims to cover 600 square kilometers of ocean. The project is expected to detect neutrino point sources within two years and identify dozens of astrophysical neutrino sources within a decade, positioning China at the forefront of neutrino astronomy, said Chen Mingjun, a researcher at"

Since its foundation in 1967 via the Bangkok Declaration, our regional grouping has been through several reinventions.\nAsean's first three reinventions\nThe first reinvention, circa 1976 was, expectedly, on regional security, given the on-going Cold War then.\nThe grouping successfully maintained peace and stability for most of the region through frameworks like the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South-east Asia (1976) and the Declaration of Asean Concord (1976). Interestingly, the very first Asean Summit only took place nine years after Asean's establishment, in February 1976, in Bali, Indonesia.\nAsean's second reinvention occurred in the 1990's, where, post-Cold War, it focused on integration. Besides the accessions of Vietnam (1995), Laos and Myanmar (1997), and Cambodia (1999), the major development in this period was the Asean Free Trade Area (AFTA), the groundwater for the Asean Economic Community (AEC).
