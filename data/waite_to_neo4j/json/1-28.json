To advance our understanding of their adaption mechanisms in extreme environments, we performed stress tolerance characterizations, whole genome sequencing, and comparative genomic analyses of a novel heat-tolerant and euryhaline strain of the unicellular cyanobacterium Cyanobacterium sp. Dongsha4 (DS4). This strain was isolated from a lagoon on Dongsha Island in the South China Sea, a habitat with fluctuations in temperature, salinity, light intensity, and nutrient supply. Results: DS4 cells can tolerate long-term high-temperature up to 50 and salinity from 0 to 6.6 %, which is similar to the results previously obtained for Cyanobact"
