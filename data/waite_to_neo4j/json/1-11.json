It left on Jan. 8, but was replaced by other Chinese ships.\n\"The PCG vessel, BRP Teresa Magbanua, has proven to be a formidable asset in ensuring that the China Coast Guard vessel 3304 is grad"

It is situated at the eastern entrance of the Straits of Singapore, at the point where the latter opens up into the South China Sea.\nPulau Batu Puteh is located at 1deg 19' 48\" N and 104deg 24' 27\" E.

An underestimated president, Carter gave much to the American people and even more to millions overseas who faced persecution and human rights abuses at home. I had the honor of serving in the Carter administration as research director for the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy.

Thailand and Malaysia, in particular, took action to prevent entry into their countries at the same created_at that pirates in the South China Sea began to target and often kill boat people, as the refugees were called.\nRecog"

    "text": "\n Predictions about 2025 come with flashing caveats: no one can know what US President-elect Donald Trump will do, let alone how the rest of the world will respond. But one can speculate. Imagine it is January 2026.\nAs 2025 began, the mood of the American business community shifted.

Some childhood diseases like measles returned. From Inauguration Day, social media hesitated to highlight efforts by public-health and information-technology professionals to correct the accompanying misinformation.\nM"
