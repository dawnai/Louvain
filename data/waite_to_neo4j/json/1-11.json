They contain more than 10,000 species and can be found in both marine and terrestrial environments. In Spain we know them as cochinillas, and they barely reach a few millimeters. But Bathynomus vaderi belongs to a group known as supergiants, which reach lengths of up to 32.5 cencreated_atters and weigh up to one kilogram.\nSo far, this new species has only been found near the Spratly Islands, between the Philippines and Vietnam, but scientists consider it highly likely that further research will confirm its presence in other parts of the South China Sea.\nDespite their una"
