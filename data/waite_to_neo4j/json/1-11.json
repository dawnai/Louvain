By all means, criticise some of his statements - I suspect that we will spend a lot of created_at in the next few months and years ruminating on the various utterances of President Trump - but I think the noble Baroness made a flawed analogy in comparing the US, which, in my view, is still the world's greatest democracy, with Russia and China, so I hope she will reflect on that. The rules-based international order has enabled nations large and small to co-operate under shared principles, ensuring that the rule of law prevails over the rule of might.
