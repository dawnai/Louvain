With an approximate displacement of 5,000 tons, the Type 054B frigate integrates numerous advancements in stealth, weaponry, and operational versatility. Notable among these is the adoption of an integrated mast design, akin to the one found on the PLANs Type 055 destroyer.\nThis integrated mast significantly enhances the ship's radar signature reduction and boosts its information processing capabilities. The design not only reduces the likelihood of enemy radar detection but also optimizes the ships operational effectiveness by minimizing interference between onboard systems.\nThe increase in displacement compared to the Type 054A frigate enables the Type 0"
