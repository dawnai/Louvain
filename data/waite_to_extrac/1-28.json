    "text": "\nThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:\nChina's homegrown open-source artificial intelligence model DeepSeek and its newly launched AI-assisted chatbot are making waves on the global tech scene, sending U.S. companies' stock prices plummeting.\nBut is DeepSeek that good when it comes to topics covered by Radio Free Asia? We decided to put its knowledge of the South China Sea to the test.\n\"What is the South China Sea?\"\nThe reply came almost instantly: \"The South China Sea is a marginal sea that is part of the Pacific Ocean, encompassing an area from the Singapore and Malacca Straits to the Strait of Taiwan.\"\nSo far so good.\nThe chatbot went on to explain that the People's Republic of China \"claims a large portion of the sea within the so-called \"Nine-Dash Line,\" and this claim is contested by other countries in the region and is \"not recognized under international law, particularly following a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which found that China's claims have no legal basis under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\"\nBut the answer disappeared almost instantly and in its place came a formulaic prompt: \"Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else.\"\nWe asked a number of additional questions about the South China Sea, such as \"How many artificial islands does China have?,\" \"Where is the Second Thomas Shoal?\" and \"What's happening between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea?\"\nThe chatbot kept insisting that it was \"not sure how to approach this type of question\" and repeatedly suggested users to \"chat about math, coding, and logic problems instead!\"\n\"I am not surprised,\" said Greg Poling, a maricreated_at analyst from the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\"I can't claim to be an expert in machine learning but my guess is that DeepSeek would avoid all subjects deemed 'sensitive' in China,\" Poling said.\n\"Try asking about Tibet!\" Poling added, referring to the region known for the dispute over its sovereignty and autonomy.\nKayla Blomquist, director of the Oxford China Policy Lab, told the BBC that until recently the Chinese government had been relatively \"hands off\" with the DeepSeek app but that may change with an announcement last week about a large investment from the central government in Beijing.\nPolitical censorship\nDeveloped by a Chinese company based in Hangzhou in southeastern China, the DeepSeek app is likely to be subject to Chinese government regulations, including laws related to content, data privacy, and stringent political censorship.\nUsers have been reporting difficulties getting information about sensitive topics such as the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 or Taiwan's independence.\nThe South China Sea is a complex geopolitical issue involving territorial disputes, military tensions, and conflicting claims by littoral countries including China. Analysts say as the waterway is one of Beijing's core interests, it is also listed as \"highly sensitive\" by censors.\nAs DeepSeek wishes to maintain access to the Chinese market, it would seek to comply with Chinese government regulations even abroad, analysts said.\nOperating similarly to the U.S.'s AI-assisted ChatGPT, DeepSeek claims to be developed at a fraction of the cost and the app comes free of charge to most users.\nBut can it be, at this stage of development, posing a great challenge for OpenAI, ChatGPT's developer? We asked ChatGPT and the answer was rather magnanimous.\n\"Not at all! DeepSeek and I serve different purposes and approaches. Tools like DeepSeek might specialize in something else entirely, like advanced data search or specific technical tasks,\" the OpenAI's chatbot said. \"Think of it like teamwork rather than rivalry!\"\nEdited by Mike Firn\n"

    "title": "The biggest international naming disputes in history",
    "created_at": "2025-01-28",
    "text": "\nOf the executive orders made by President Donald Trump on his first day back in the White House, one generating tons of attention was perhaps the most symbolic: renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, in addition to ordering Alaska's Denali be changed back to Mt. McKinley, after the 25th president. But these are not the only global naming disputes in recent history.\nGreece and Macedonia\nFor over a quarter century, the Balkans were at odds over the name of the Macedonia region, which contains large parts of Southeast Europe. Macedonia \"has long existed as a northern region in Greece,\" said the BBC, and a quarrel began in 1991 when a \"new nation, born out of the collapse of Yugoslavia,\" began calling itself Macedonia.\nThe Greeks were \"fiercely proud of the ancient heritage of Alexander the Great and his father Philip II of Macedon,\" said the BBC, and felt the former Yugoslavia was encroaching on their territory. A deal was eventually reached in 2019 to name the country North Macedonia, but in 2024 Greece accused the nation's \"new center-right government of breaking a historic deal on the country's name,\" said The Associated Press, potentially reigniting the feud.\nBlack Sea\nRussian politician Denis Bulanov has proposed renaming the Black Sea to the Russian Sea. Bulanov was reportedly inspired by Trump's decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico, and \"claimed that the Black Sea was historically referred to as the 'Russian Sea,' mentioned in some ancient Rus' chronicles,\" said Ukraine's United24 Media.\nThe name change \"would be for domestic use within Russia only. I'm not insisting that other countries bordering the Black Sea recognize the name change,\" Bulanov said to a translated Russian media outlet on Telegram. It is unclear if Russian President Vladimir Putin supports the change.\nSouth China Sea\nMost Westerners understandably call the text of water south of China the South China Sea. But Asian nations have been pressing for the sea's name to be changed. China, Vietnam and the Philippines all have different names for it, and these \"are not just semantic; they each advance a nationalist narrative and a historical claim,\" said The Diplomat.\nThis \"also reflects the geopolitical stakes in the South China Sea, where overlapping maricreated_at and territorial claims have led to rising tensions among nations,\" said The Diplomat. Countries have feuded over the sea's name in the past; in 2017, Indonesia angered China when it announced it would \"refer to the northern areas of its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea as the 'North Natuna Sea,'\" said CNN.\nIndia\nIndians have long feuded over the name of their country. While the nation is officially called the Republic of India, many have pushed to change its name to \"Bharat,\" the Hindu word for India. In India itself, India and Bharat are \"used interchangeably officially and by the public,\" said Al Jazeera.\nHindus have been pining to change the country's name officially, and the nation's constitution refers to it as \"India, that is Bharat.\" India's president has also referred to herself as the president of Bharat. And \"while some supporters of the name Bharat say 'India' was given by British colonizers, historians say the name predates colonial rule by centuries,\" said Reuters.\nPersian Gulf\nThe Persian Gulf, separating Iran from the rest of the Middle East, remains embroiled in a naming controversy. Most Iranians call it the Persian Gulf, but \"Arabs are angling for it to be called the Arabian Gulf,\" said The Economist. The naming disagreement reflects \"increasingly troubled relations\" in the region, given that it is a \"natural barrier for centuries of Arab-Persian rivalry.\"\nThis debate has been brewing for decades, as \"states on the Arab side began calling it the 'Arabian Gulf'\" during the 1960s, said The Guardian. Most recently, Iraq stirred anger when it named a 2023 regional soccer tournament the \"Arabian Gulf Cup,\" to the ire of Iran\n"

    "text": "\nTHE PHILIPPINES should not rely heavily on the US to build its defense capabilities in the face of its sea dispute with China, political analysts said, citing the expected “transactional” approach to bilateral ties under a second Trump presidency.\n“President Trump has not been shy saying that everything the US does in the international field has a price,” Michael Henry Ll. Yusingco, a fellow at the Ateneo de Manila University Policy Center, said in a Facebook Messenger chat.\n“The Marcos administration should not be naïve to think that the US will act in the name of world peace or international law. It would be better to anticipate that the America First Policy may be applied in the literal sense by Trump,” he added.\nLast week, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio talked about China’s “dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea” with Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique A. Manalo and underscored the “ironclad” US defense commitment to Manila.\nThe US is the Philippines’ major security partner, with a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty compelling both nations to defend each other in case of an armed attack.\nThe Philippines has been embroiled in wrangles at sea with China in the past two years and the two countries have faced off regularly around disputed features in the South China Sea that fall within Manila’s exclusive economic zone.\nChina claims almost the entire South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled in 2016 that China’s claims had no legal basis, a ruling Beijing rejects.\n“He (Mr. Rubio) merely reiterates and reaffirms the official policy of the US towards the Philippines,” Rommel C. Banlaoi, president of the Philippine Society for International Security Studies, said in a Viber message.\n“What we need to see is how the Trump administration will implement this policy amidst persistent conflicts in the South China Sea.”\nThe US military has moved its Typhon launchers, which can fire multipurpose missiles up to thousands of kilometers, from Laoag airfield to another location on the island of Luzon, a senior Philippine government source said on Jan. 23, according to Reuters.\nThe Tomahawk cruise missiles in the launchers can hit targets in both China and Russia from the Philippines. The SM-6 missiles it also carries can strike air or sea targets more than 200 km away.\nChina’s Foreign Ministry accused the Philippines on Jan. 23 of creating tension and confrontation in the region, and urged it to “correct its wrong practices.”\nThe deployment of the missile system is “extremely irresponsible” for regional security, Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a news briefing last week.\nTyphons are relatively easy to produce — drawing on large stockpiles and designs that have been around for a decade or more — and could help the US and its allies catch up quickly in an Indo-Pacific missile race in which China has a big lead.\nSecurity engagements between the allies have soared under Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., who has moved closer to Washington and allowed the expansion of military bases that American forces could access, including facilities facing the democratically governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own.\n“I believe that we are off to a good start, but then again, it would depend on how well we are able to elevate our agency in the eyes of Washington as well, so we have to do more in that regard so it’s safe to say that the Philippine-US alliance remains intact,” Don McClain Gill, who teaches foreign relations at De La Salle University, said in a Facebook Messenger chat.\nUS AID PAUSE\nMeanwhile, Senate Minority Floor Leader Aquilino Martin “Koko” D. Pimentel said the government should not be fazed by the Trump government’s decision to freeze new funding foreign assistance programs for 90-days.\n“We should learn to live with this decision,” he told reporters in a Viber message. “The Philippines should not be dependent on foreign aid, although we should be welcoming of all aid without strings and conditions that are extended to us.”\nThe US Department of State on Jan. 20 issued an executive order that froze foreign funding, with exceptions for emergency food programs and military aid to Israel and Egypt.\nUS President Donald J. Trump ordered the 90-day pause in foreign development assistance pending a review of these programs in relation to his administration’s foreign policy.\nWashington provided foreign aid worth $60 billion in 2023 or about 1% of the US budget.\n“The United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values,” according to a copy of the order published on the US Department of State website.\n“They serve to destabilize world peace by promoting ideas in foreign countries that are directly inverse to harmonious and stable relations internal to and among countries.”\n“[Pausing foreign aid] is not a good indicator especially considering there were previous promises from US Foreign Affairs officials that our working relationship and projects will not change,” Hansley A. Juliano, who teaches political science at the Ateneo de Manila University, said in a Facebook Messenger chat.\n“It potentially belies the assumption of the security sector that the US will remain a reliable Philippine security partner.”\nThe Southeast Asian nation, one of the weakest in the world in terms of military capability, is important to Washington’s efforts to push back against China, which claims the South China Sea almost in its entirety.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said its 44-meter vessel BRP Cabra had managed to prevent a bigger Chinese ship from getting closer to the coastline of Zambales province.\n“BRP Cabra, despite its smaller size [than] the China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel 3103, has been successful in preventing [it]] from advancing closer to the coast of Zambales,” it said in a statement on Sunday night.\nIt added that the ship had kept CCG 3103 at a distance of 185.2 kilometers from the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nWhile BRP Cabra is only 44 meters in length, the China Coast Guard deployed another vessel at a distance, “appearing to serve as a supporting vessel for CCG 3103,” the PCG said. “Additionally, CCG 5901 was also spotted a few nautical miles away from CCG 3103.”\nThe Philippine Coast Guard vowed not to allow China to alter the order in the South China Sea by encroaching closer to the Zambales coastline in northern Philippines.\n“Despite these developments, the PCG remains committed to challenging the illegal presence of Chinese Coast Guard vessels,” it said.\n“Our continued presence serves as a clear demonstration of our commitment to upholding our sovereign rights and a steadfast stance against any violations of international law, all while prioritizing a peaceful approach,” it added.\nThe PCG at the weekend accused CCG 3103 of using a long-range acoustic device against its vessel near the Zambales, weeks since it started monitoring the area after Beijing deployed its biggest coast guard ship in the Philippine EEZ.\nThe PCG said CCG 3103 had replaced another vessel deployed near the Zambales and “appears to be escorted by CCG 5901 or the “Chinese monster ship.”\nThe Philippines has accused China of intimidating Filipino fishermen near Scarborough Shoal and normalizing its “illegal presence” after Beijing sent the monster ship, the world’s biggest coast guard vessel, into the Philippine EEZ on Jan. 4.\nA United Nations-backed court in the Hague voided China’s expansive claim in the South China Sea in 2016, as it ruled the shoal is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen.\n"

An LRAD produces high-decibel sounds that can potentially damage hearing.\nComic book\nIn his post on X, Tarriela also defended the release of a comic book on the West Philippine Sea, rejecting China's claim that it promotes anti-China sencreated_atnt. He said the book is an educational tool based on historical and legal facts.\nHe emphasized that the comic book primarily aims to educate Filipinos on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 Arbitral Award, which invalidated China's expansive claims in the South China Sea.\n'This foundational knowledge is essential for Filipinos to avoid becoming victims of fake news and misinformation, particularly claims from a country like China, which is over 500 nautical miles away, asserting sovereignty over specific maricreated_at features,' Tarriela said.\nHe stressed there are historical documents such as the 1734 Murillo Velarde map and various treaties that support the Philippines' maricreated_at claims and entitlements in the South China Sea.\nBeijing, citing a Chinese expert, said on Sunday that the publication would not help resolve South China Sea disputes and would even damage long-term bilateral relations.\nThe Chinese state media claimed the comic book aims to manipulate young students through brainwashing approach.\n'It is worth questioning whether this 'expert' is even aware of China's illegal deployment of vessels in the West Philippine Sea or the harassment of Filipino fishermen by Chinese maricreated_at forces,' Tarriela said.\n'If he is truly an expert, he should recognize that this comic book publication is a minor concern compared to the escalatory and provocative actions of his own government,' he added.\nHe also challenged China's legal basis for its territorial claims, citing the arbitral ruling invalidating its nine-dash line, now a ten-dash line, claim.\n'Would it be more constructive for our diplomatic relations to rely solely on imaginary dashes, while dismissing a comic book grounded in factual information as harmful?'\nBoarding officer course\nMeanwhile, the PCG and the United States Coast Guard Southeast Asia Training Team concluded on Friday their multinational Boarding Officer Course in Davao City.\nThe event was funded by the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.\nThirty-two participants attended the training event, including 20 members of the PCG and the Philippine National Police-Maricreated_at Group, and partners from the Vietnam Coast Guard, Vietnam Customs Anti-Smuggling and Investigations Department, Vietnam Department of Fisheries Surveillance and the Indonesia Coast Guard.

    "text": "\n2025 JAN 28 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily China News -- Investigators discuss new findings in Science - Ecology and Evolution. According to news reporting originating from Qinzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"A new species of the genus Microcosmus was described in this study based on specimens collected from the coast of Xilian Town, Xuwen County, Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province, China. The morphological and molecular characteristics of this new species, Microcosmus sp. z YZ-2024 (YZ-2024), distinguish it from other sea squirts.\" \n Financial support for this research came from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). \n Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Ocean College, \"Firstly, YZ-2024 can be preliminarily distinguished by the following morphological features: (1) smooth surface of the tunica, without protuberances; (2) except for the attachment site, the tunica is orange-red; (3) absence of neural ganglia, and the tunica does not contract abruptly when disturbed; (4) the heart is oval-shaped. Most importantly, the mitochondrial genome characteristics of YZ-2024 effectively and accurately distinguish it from other congeneric species, with a mitochondrial genome size of 14,520 bp (GenBank No. ) and the proportions of bases A, T, G, and C comprising 26.83%, 47.16%, 16.91%, and 9.10%, respectively. Except for the gene COX1, the mitochondrial genome arrangement of YZ-2024 is totally different from that of 22 other species in the class Ascidiacea. Evolutionary analysis has indicated that YZ-2024 clusters with its congeneric species Microcosmus sulcatus. Interestingly, YZ-2024 belongs to Pyuridae, but it clustered with 12 species of Styelidae into a clade. Based on this, it can be suggested that YZ-2024 is a new species of sea squirt in the northern Beibu Gulf of the South China Sea.\" \n According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Moreover, this study is the first report of molecular identification of sea squirt species in the northern Beibu Gulf of the South China Sea.\" \n For more information on this research see: Morphological Characteristics, Mitochondrial Genome, and Evolutionary Insights Into a New Sea Squirt From the Beibu Gulf.

And doing this through not only words but through muscle,\" he said during a recent interview with Hoover Institution's \"Battlegrounds\".\nThe DND chief was referring to China's illegal activities in the West Philippine Sea where Chinese maricreated_at forces continue to swarm.\nThis was the offshoot of the Chinese enactment of a maricreated_at law that claimed almost all of the South China Sea (SCS) waters as internal waters of China.\n\"So what I'm trying to say right now is for the Philippines, what China is doing makes the Philippines, compels the Philippines to defend itself, assert its rights against China, Teodoro said.\nSo they have themselves to blame. If we are choosing the side of the right, the correct, not the physical right, but the correct side, the correct path, to use their words, take the right path and correct route,\" he added.\nTeodoro said China is also trying to crowd out the country by \"trying to change narratives, trying to subvert our domestic economy, trying to influence others not to side with the Philippines.\"\nHe added it includes telling the world that the 2016 Arbitral Award is just a scrap of paper.\nThe 2016 Arbitral Ruling is where the Permanent Court of Arbitration declared that the nine-dash-line of China has no legal basis. - PNA\n"

    "text": "\nA Philippine platoon will be trained on using a US mid-range missile system next month, ahead of joint drills, Manila's military said Tuesday, in a move that will likely further fuel tensions with China.\nThe US military deployed the Typhon missile system in the northern Philippines last year as part of an annual joint exercise, but it was not removed after the war games ended.\nThe system's presence on Philippine soil has angered Beijing, whose forces have engaged in several confrontations with Philippine vessels in recent months over disputed reefs and waters in the South China Sea.\nLast month, the Philippine Army said it was planning to acquire the Typhon system as part of a push to secure its maricreated_at interests, sparking warnings from China of a regional \"arms race\".\nA new platoon from the Philippines' Army Artillery Regiment will receive \"orientation and familiarisation\" training on the system, starting in the second or third week of February, army spokesman Colonel Louie Dema-ala said in a press conference.\nThe week-long training will involve troops from the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force of the US Army Pacific, Dema-ala added.\n\"This is a continuation of what we've learned in the first (training) iteration. New units will be involved in the training and a continuation of the previous platoon that was trained last year,\" Dema-ala said.\n\"As long as MRC (mid-range missile capability) is here, we maximise its utilisation to train our personnel in new technology,\" he added.\nDema-ala said the training is in preparation for this year's Salaknib, an annual joint exercise between the Philippines and US armies.\nThe training location cannot be disclosed, he told reporters, noting that there will be no firing of the Typhon system.\nPhilippine military spokeswoman Colonel Francel Padilla said moving the launcher from its initial location to a different part of the country is a test \"to see how these logistical trains can be transported to certain locations, to certain salient points.\"\nPhilippine military officials have said the Typhon system would be able to protect vessels up to 370 kilometres (200 nautical miles) off the coast, the limit of its maricreated_at entitlement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nLast week, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning renewed calls for the Philippines to \"stop going further down the wrong path\".\n\"Let me stress again that by bringing this strategic offensive weapon into this part of the world, the Philippines is essentially creating tensions and antagonism in the region and inciting geopolitical confrontation and an arms race,\" she said.\n"

    "text": "\nUS President Donald Trump boasts that he is an agent of big change at home as well as abroad. But a closer look at the likelihood chances he’ll upend past foreign policy decisions, including those of his predecessor Joe Biden, suggests that the extent of his changes might not match his New Golden Age rhetoric.\nOverturning established policy from presidency to presidency is relatively rare. Loose promises of dramatic shifts can be politically risky when they backfire, experts point out.\n“Across administrations—even ones as different as those of Biden and Trump – foreign policy is something like an iceberg,” Richard Fontaine, CEO of the Center for a New American Security, wrote recently. “The visible portion is gleaming and jagged and draws much of the attention. Yet it also has a far bigger and underexamined foundation, one that tends to remain mostly unchanged.”\nThere are recent examples of promises implied or made but not kept.\nClinton case: China MFN status\nIn 1991, when Democratic Party presidential candidate Bill Clinton campaigned against Republican incumbent George H.W. Bush, Clinton accused the first President Bush of being soft on China, ignoring its human rights record for trade advantages. Clinton promised that he would be tougher.\nHe was not.\nSoon after Clinton arrived in Washington, human rights took second place behind American business peoples’ desire to cash in on China commerce. Clinton offered China the trade advantages conferred by most-favored-nation status, which guarantees non-discriminatory treatment between trade partners. If China would just make a minor democratic gesture or two at home, it would get the advantages.\nChinese leaders rebuffed the plea. Clinton provided MFN anyway.\nObama case: Syrian chemical weapons\nIn 2012, President Barak Obama, having begun his second term in office, sternly warned Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad not to use chemical weapons against rebels. Doing so would cross a “red line” and result in dramatic US military action.\nA year later, Assad bombarded pro-democracy civilians with poisonous chemicals, and killed some 1,400 men, women and children. Obama did nothing, except to blame the US Congress for not specifically authorizing military action.\nTrump faces three big minefields of decision-making left over from the previous administration – the Ukraine war, an assertive China in East Asia and terminating the Gaza war. He may be finding that discretion is the better part of diplomacy.\n      Latest stories     \n                  \nTrump’s Columbia beatdown a message to China, Russia\n          \n                  \nHow DeepSeek did it\n          \n                  \nDeepSeek’s shock in wider US vs China perspective\n          \nNow Ukraine\nBiden fulsomely backed Ukraine and distinctly disdained Putin himself. In the runup to the November election, Trump described Vladimir Putin as a “genius” and seemed ready to break with Biden policies. \nLast week, however, Trump changed his tune. Praise for Putin morphed into ridicule. “It’s a ridiculous war,” he said of the Ukraine carnage. “I think Russia’s going to be in big trouble.”\nHe said Putin is “not doing so well,” suggested that the Russian president’s stewardship was “no way to run a country.” Trump said Putin had made a “big mistake” by invading Ukraine. \nOne key feature of his predecessor’s policy that Trump already shared: opposiiton to sending US troops to fight the Russians.\nBesides Russia, Trump is inherited a pair of key crises, and it appears he is not thinking to distance himself from policies of recent predecessors: a bellicose China and war in the Middle East.\nChina\nAs China has ramped up its threat to Taiwan and carved out naval exclusion zones in the East China Sea and South China Sea,  Washington’s responses over three administrations have been cautious.\nObama worried about Chinese growing economic entry into the US market, although he generally welcomed Beijing’s capitalist turn. However, he coined the phrase “pivot to China,” to urge the US to bolster security in the Western Pacific.\nTrump followed up during his 2017-2021 first term, and warned of increasing Chinese military power. He asserted that Beijing was trying to “displace the US in the Indo-Pacific region, expand the reach of its state-driven economic model and reorder the region in its favor.” He increased US military spending by about 17 per cent over Obama’s.\nIn addition, Trump tried to rebalance US trade with China, an action that had little effect on China’s exports to the US (they increased) or American exports into China (they decreased).\nAfter Biden took power, he maintained and expanded Trump’s tariffs. He also built on Trump’s and Obama’s China worries by  beginning to reinvigorate traditional alliances along the China Seas and into the Pacific Ocean: with  South Korea, Japan, The Philippines and Australia. Chinese leader Xi Jinping signaled his irritation with the move, accusing Biden of trying to “contain” China.\nTrump has never spoken of undoing Biden’s work.\nHis choices of a pair of China hawks to lead his foreign affairs team may speak louder than words: new Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, both are considered tough on Beijing.\nNo sooner had Rubio been confirmed in his post last week that he had a phone conversation with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and focused on the “United States’ commitment to our allies in the region.” He also expressed “serious concern over China’s coercive actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea,” according to a State Department account.\nWang responded with a serving of formal diplomacy spiced with condescension. “We will never allow Taiwan to be separated from China,” Wang said. Wang then added a phrase used by teachers to scold unruly students, “I hope you will act accordingly,” which roughly translates as “behave yourself.”\nWaltz has praised Biden’s alliance building in Asia, a rare piece of praise in highly partisan Washington. Shortly after his nomination, he called China the “greatest adversary” of the United States.\nTrump has yet to remark, or remake, one of Biden’s most surprising declarations. In a half dozen statements, Biden pledging that the US would militarily defend Taiwan, which China considers its own, if Beijing attacks it. The statements broke almost a half-century of US  “strategic ambiguity” meant to keep China guessing about what the Americans would do if China invaded the island.\nMiddle East\nIn the Middle East, Trump desires a quick end to the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist terror group. He supports Israel, which is one of the longest-lasting constants of US foreign policy. Nonetheless, he has expressed horror at the heavy death toll among Palestinians.\nAs Trump was preparing to return to Washington, he entered into a diplomatic partnership with Bidden. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rebuffed Biden’s efforts to obtain a truce, even though the US administration had showered Israel with weapons to fight the war and sent naval warships to the Levantine coast to deter Iranian attacks on the Jewish state.\nSign up for one of our free newsletters\nTrump worked to get Netanyahu to agree to a 42-day ceasefire, by adding enticements to the diplomatic pressure. Both sweeteners went beyond anything Biden had offered:\nHe would order the lifting of US sanctions on Netanyahu allies who occupy settlements in the West Bank and who have violently attacked Palestinian residents.\nHe also proposed a radical solution to the problems Palestinians will have as they return to badly damaged homes in the enclave. He suggested transferring more than half of the two million residents into Egypt and Jordan.\nTrump said the exile could be for a short created_at or “long-term.”\nThe offers appealed to Netanyahu. Settlers represent a key voting bloc supporting his government. Moreover, Netanyahu has long favored “transfer” of Palestinians from both Gaza and the West Bank to Arab countries. He was once associated with an organization called “Jordan is Palestine, Inc.”\nThe neo-transfer idea died quickly. Egypt and Jordan rejected hosting expelled Palestinians.\nThere could be trouble ahead for the truce deal, which includes a full Israeli exit from the Gaza Strip.\nUltra-nationalist members of Netanyahu’s government coalition are threatening to bring  down the government. Hamas must be totally destroyed, they insist, and Israel forces must stay in the Gaza Strip for an open-ended period occupation, they said. They pointed out that their demands were goals that Netanyahu himself had laid out.\nIf the Netanyahu government falls, it’s not clear if a new coalition can be built. The public at large wants Hamas destroyed. Elections would take created_at and undermine Trump’s desire to end the war immediately.\nIn short, it’s likely that Trump’s deal-making skill will face plenty of challenges before the Gaza war is over.\nThank you for registering!\nAn account was already registered with this email.

    "title": "Commentary: How trade-reliant Malaysia can navigate Trump's presidency",
    "created_at": "2025-01-28",
    "text": "\nSINGAPORE: Malaysia recorded 5.1 per cent growth in 2024, surpassing expectations thanks to its recovering tourism and exports sectors, rebound in construction and real estate activity and strong labour market. These have been supported by the government's fiscal policies and stable interest rates.\nHowever, entering 2025, there is uncertainty about the implications of a second Trump term in the United States. US President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could trigger permanent change around trade ties and supply chains. There are also rising risks that retaliation from targeted countries could escalate into a trade war that benefits notext.\nMalaysia will chair the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) during this fragile period. Escalating tensions, including potential conflict in the South China Sea could force a shift in geopolitical alignment that challenges the neutrality of ASEAN. MALAYSIA HAS COME A LONG WAY\nMalaysia has come a long way since the Asian Financial Crisis with stronger institutions, more diverse inflows of foreign direct investment, orderly functioning of domestic markets and focused plans for structural reforms.\nOne area that has shown tremendous progress is Malaysia's semiconductor industry. The country is creating global integrated circuit champions and attracting leading international companies to establish wafer fabrication facilities and data centres.\nThe next step is to focus on digital investments and employ more sustainable production methods to reduce carbon emissions. In this vein, Malaysian automaker Proton launched its first electric vehicle in December 2024, four decades after introducing its first national car in 1985.\nRegional development has been a key priority with incentives offered for investments across 21 sectors in selected states, including Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu, Sabah and Sarawak.\nA major milestone will be the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone, which aims to create 20,000 skilled jobs. The Forest City Special Financial Zone, launched in September 2024, will further stimulate growth and investment in Johor. RISK OF CURRENCY VOLATILITY\nFor Malaysia, the path forward is clear - to diversify its economy and accelerate critical reforms.\nHowever, the currency markets could throw a spanner in the works. The US dollar has strengthened since Trump won the 2024 presidential election. Markets expect more tariffs and more hawkish signals for US interest rates.\nAs a result, Malaysia has to brace for further currency volatility and potential ringgit weakness alongside other Asian currencies. The central bank has to maintain exchange rate flexibility and ensure the ringgit's value is not misaligned from economic fundamentals.\nThe good news, compared with 2017 when Trump started his first term, is that Malaysia now has stronger macro fundamentals that provide underlying support for its currency.\nThe ringgit will be able to tide through the next phase of volatility with greater resilience due to efforts to encourage more consistent inflows by government-linked companies and Malaysian corporates, as they repatriate their overseas profits back home.\nLiberalised foreign exchange policies for non-resident development financial institutions and multilateral development banks will also help. This is because they are now able to structure financing in ringgit to help mitigate foreign exchange risks and smoothen the volatility in the ringgit. STRENGTHENING TRADE TIES\nTrump's second term could lead to tariffs on Malaysian goods or that of Malaysia's key trading partners. The best way to mitigate tariff risk is by ensuring exports are \"truly Malaysian\". For goods with cross-border supply chains, it is important that a significant part of the production is done within Malaysia so that the US cannot accuse companies of using Malaysia as a conduit to escape tariffs.\nAnother way is for Malaysia to import more goods from the US to balance the trade surplus, and to position itself as an enabler of US productivity growth rather than a competitor. This can be done by enhancing the value of products using US imports and technology. This helps Malaysia ascend the value chain and accelerate US innovation.\nMalaysia continues to explore trade agreements and multilateral cooperation to diversify its markets and import sources. A free trade agreement between Malaysia and South Korea is expected to be finalised in 2025, while the negotiation of a free-trade agreement with the European Union is still ongoing.\nMalaysia also officially became a new partner country of BRICS along with Indonesia (which is now a full member) and Thailand. Taken together, these will enhance the country's trade resilience.\nAs ASEAN chair of 2025, Malaysia will undertake high-level trade negotiations on behalf of the regional bloc.\nNegotiations to enhance the free trade agreement between ASEAN and China are expected to conclude in 2025, and will cover upgrades in the digital and green economies.\nThough this will strengthen China's importance as an economic partner to ASEAN, the US is still the region's largest investor. It is thus equally important to maintain warm ties with the world's largest economy.\nMeanwhile further engagements are planned with ASEAN+ partners including Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand.\nAmid heightened trade frictions and geopolitical tensions, Malaysia needs to attract diverse investments and strengthen trade links with a wider range of partners. Its chairmanship of ASEAN is also an opportunity to showcase the benefits of regional integration.\nJulia Goh is Senior Economist (Malaysia) at UOB. INITIAL: el\n"

    "text": "\nTHE Philippine government through its sovereign wealth fund has agreed to buy a 20% stake in a Filipino company that has a 40% stake in the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP), according to the presidential palace.\nThe Presidential Communications Office (PCO) said in a statement that the Maharlika Investment Corp. (MIC), which manages the Maharlika Investment Fund, signed a binding agreement with Synergy Grid & Development Phils., Inc. (SGP) for an undisclosed amount.\nMIC will subscribe to preferred shares offered by SGP, which owns 40.2% of NGCP. NGCP operates the country’s power grid.\nThis marks MIC’s first investment since President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. signed the law creating the country’s first sovereign wealth fund in July 2023.\n“I think, in the end, we found a good solution to everyone’s concern,” Mr. Marcos said during the signing of the deal between MIC President and Chief Executive Officer Rafael D. Consing, Jr. and SGP Chairman Henry T. Sy, Jr. on Monday.\nMr. Consing was quoted as saying that the deal would give MIC two seats each on the boards of SGP and NGCP.\n“Once the acquisition is completed, we shall be entitled to two out of nine seats in the SGP board, after the total seats are increased from seven to nine. At NGCP, the government gains representation through two out of 15 board seats, following an increase in the total seats from 10 to 15,” he said.\nThe PCO statement quoted Mr. Consing as saying that MIC’s maiden investment “would safeguard the nation’s power supply from external threats and disruptions.” He noted the government also needs “to have a say in NGCP decisions.”\nThe deal comes amid concerns raised over the 40% ownership by the State Grid Corp. of China (SGCC), a government-owned enterprise of the Chinese Communist Party, in the grid operator. Critics including lawmakers from both Houses of Congress have alleged that engineers in Beijing could plunge the entire country into darkness with the flick of a switch.\nTensions between the Philippines and China have worsened in the past year amid confrontations in the South China Sea where both have competing claims.\nNGCP in 2007 was granted a 25-year concession to operate the Philippines’ transmission system, with the possibility of renewal for an additional 25 years. It began operations in 2009.\nEnergy Secretary Raphael P.M. Lotilla said the MIC’s investment in NGCP is a “step towards attaining our goal of ensuring security of supply, reliability, affordability, and promoting competition in the power sector.”\nWith two board seats each in NGCP and SGP, Mr. Lotilla said: “Maharlika can pave the way for better coordination between the DoE (Department of Energy) and the NGCP to help expand transmission connections in a created_atly manner and speed up the interconnection of our power grid across the archipelago.”\n“Government investment in transmission would make additional capital available for NGCP to deploy in the pursuit of completing transmission projects on created_at.”\nSought for comment, NGCP Assistant Vice-President and Head of Public Relations Cynthia P. Alabanza said in a Viber message, “NGCP has no statement. Please wait for the relevant disclosures to be made by the parties concerned.”\nLast week, NGCP officials told lawmakers that it is a Filipino- controlled company.\nSpeaking before the House Committee on Legislative Franchises, Mr. Sy, who sits as the vice chairman of NGCP, said Filipino corporations Monte Oro Grid Resources Corp. and Calaca High Power Corp. each hold 30%, or a total of 60% of the outstanding capital stock of NGCP.\nMr. Sy reiterated at the hearing that “NGCP alone, through its Filipino directors and personnel, and not the Chinese, has control over the system operations.”\nThe NGCP has said it is open to a national security review as authorized by a 2022 law that liberalized foreign ownership in select domestic industries.\n“The entry of the MIC into the NGCP should serve as a check on the operations of national grid, particularly whether foreign interests are being advanced in enterprises deemed public utilities,” said InfraWatch PH convenor Terry L. Ridon.\n“On the other hand, the MIC and government should be able to benefit from the substantial margins generated by the grid and contribute to the gains of the sovereign wealth fund,” he added in a Facebook Messenger chat.\nMr. Ridon said the country’s power regulator should determine whether the grid’s margins are reasonable and reflect prices affording the least cost to the public.\nAteneo de Manila University economics professor Leonardo A. Lanzona, on the other hand, said the investment deal was “strictly unnecessary as the government already has sufficient regulatory authority over NGCP.”\n“The key challenge lies in effective enforcement of existing mechanisms rather than direct ownership,” he said via Messenger chat.\n“If the government can strengthen its oversight without financial investment, it may achieve similar results while preserving public funds for other critical infrastructure needs,” he added.\nThe MIC, which was created by a 2023 law, has an authorized capital stock of P500 billion. Of this, P125 billion were sourced from the investible funds of the Land Bank of the Philippines (LANDBANK) and the Development Bank of the Philippines, as well as contributions of the National Government which include dividend remittances of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.\nAsked whether the investment deal was a prudent decision, LANDBANK President and Chief Executive Officer Lynette V. Ortiz said in an interview: “I have to say yes, of course.”\n“I think it’s all aligned with the mandate on providing sustainable power that’s affordable and a grid that is reliable,” she said.\nMr. Lotilla also likened the government’s investment in transmission to the United Kingdom’s decision to renationalize its transmission system operator last year.\n“It will be recalled that the UK renationalized the British power system operator in September 2024 to support energy security, help keep bills down, and facilitate the entry of more renewable energy projects,” he said.\n"

    "text": "\n With Donald J. Trump as president, the United States is back to its old game of being an imperial power.\nThe dictionary defines imperialism as 'the policy or act of extending a country's power into other territories or gaining control over another country's politics or economics.'\nAmerica is an imperialist power. It will court, cajole, coerce, intimidate and even invade other nations to get what it wants. The Panama Canal from Panama, the Gulf of Mexico from Mexico, Greenland from Denmark, Canada from the Canadians. These are among the few of Trump's current obsessions in pursuit of his, and America's, imperialist instincts.\nWith Trump in America and Xi Jinping in China, expect intensifying trade wars and territorial battles in the coming years.\nChina wants to get Taiwan (its province) and nearly the entire South China Sea (with 3.5 million sq kms of area), including all its islands, isles, reefs and rocks. Recently, the Chinese navy entered Philippine territory, a strategic possession.\nAmid the din and horrific consequences of imperialist rivalries, what is a nation like the Philippines supposed to do? Self-reliance and nationalism.\nTwice in the past, the Philippines proved its resilience towards imperialism - in 1521 (Battle of Mactan) and in 1901 (Battle of Balangiga).\nIn Mactan on April 27, 1521, the natives, numbering 1,000 and led by their fat and aging chief Lapulapu, trounced an invading fully armed force of 220 led by Ferdinand Magellan, using only spears, bows and arrows. Magellan's text was never found (it was cut to pieces). Magellan's Cross was never found (it was burned).\nIn the 16th century, Spain was the world's naval power, one of the world's oldest navies. The Spaniards, the conquistadores, defeated mighty empires like Aztec and Inca. So Lapulapu's victory in Mactan 503 years ago is the equivalent today of Filipinos defeating the US Seventh Fleet.\nThe first major loss of the US Army overseas was in the town of Balangiga on Samar Island on Sept. 28, 1901.\nThe battle was planned by Captain Eugenio Daza, area commander of Captain General Vicente Lukbán's forces in southeastern Samar. The attack was led by Valeriano Abanador, Balangiga police chief.\nOf the 74 men of the US Army's Company C, 36 were killed in action, including all its commissioned officers: Captain Thomas W. Connell, First Lieutenant Edward A. Bumpus and Major Richard S. Griswold. Twenty-two Americans were wounded in action and four were missing in action. Eight died later of wounds received in combat; only four escaped unscathed. The Filipinos captured 100 rifles and 25,000 rounds of ammunition and suffered 28 dead and 22 wounded. Dressed as women, the Filipino army used nothing more than bolos.\nThe encounter is described as the 'worst defeat of United States Army since George Armstrong Custer's last stand in the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876' and its worst defeat before Vietnam in 1975.\nEmbarrassed worldwide, US president Theodore Roosevelt ordered Major General Adna R. Chaffee, military governor of the Philippines, to pacify Samar. Chaffee appointed BGen. Jacob H. Smith to do the task.\nSmith declared, 'I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn; the more you kill and burn, the better it will please me ... The interior of Samar must be made a howling wilderness ... Kill anyone over 10 years of age.'\nSamar was a major center for Manila hemp production, which was financing Philippine forces on the island. At the same created_at, US interests were eager to secure control of the hemp trade, which was vital for the US Navy and American agro-industries such as cotton.\nMactan and Balangiga proved that Filipinos can defeat a superior enemy, despite the latter's advantages, in number of soldiers, modern weaponry, global network.\nMax Boot of the Washington Post writes about Trump's idol, William McKinley, the 25th US president:\n'Trump's affinity for McKinley would appear to run deeper than mere tariffs. McKinley is remembered, after all, primarily for his promotion of US imperialism: He fought a 'splendid little war' against Spain and subsequently turned the Philippines into a US colony, took possession of Guam and Puerto Rico, annexed Hawaii and made Cuba into a protectorate. Trump seems eager to inaugurate a new era of territorial expansion and high tariffs, à la McKinley. A glance back at the 1890s suggests why these are both really bad ideas to resurrect:\n'Even McKinley came to see the limits of tariffs: as president, he embraced the benefits of 'reciprocity' (lowering US tariffs in return for tariff reductions in other countries), and, in the last speech he gave, in 1901, he warned that economic 'isolation is no longer possible or desirable.' In later years, US policymakers would abandon his high-tariff policies and promote free trade.\n'McKinley's embrace of American imperialism proved fleeting, for very good reason... By foolishly annexing the Philippines in 1899, McKinley embroiled America in another conflict that cost the lives of more than 4,200 US soldiers and 20,000 Filipino combatants. More than 200,000 Filipino civilians also died from violence, famine and disease, and US soldiers committed war crimes that shamed the nation.\n'The United States eventually won the conflict but secured no real strategic or economic advantage; the US bases in the Philippines were easily overrun by the Japanese in 1942.\n'Little wonder that, in future years, US leaders eschewed colonialism and embraced Woodrow Wilson's policy of national self-determination. By the same token, US leaders focused on lowering, not raising, trade barriers. Now Trump seems determined to turn back the clock in ways that can only encourage other countries to erect their own tariffs and to undertake their own territorial expansions - as China would like to do in Taiwan and as Russia is already doing in Ukraine.'\n"

CLAUDIA TENNEY (R-NY)\nMARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR\n[*] MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Joining me now to talk more about it is New York Congresswoman Claudia Tenney, a member of the House Ways and Means, and Intelligence Committees. Congresswoman, it's good to see you this morning, another year in Florida, at your retreat with your colleagues there. But, let me first kick things off on the border here, and what we're hearing from Kristi Noem. New York City is now the target for ICE.\nREP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R-NY): This is tremendous, Maria. I am so happy to see this, and I've been home in my district last weekend and I'll be going back tomorrow. All I've heard from especially a lot of senior citizens and others is how thrilled they are that we're seeing these absolutely violent criminal illegal immigrants that are being harbored by these sanctuary cities, being taken out of our communities and making our communities safer. This is a huge win for the Trump administration. It shows that we have decisive leadership. We do not have the paralysis of analysis and the really just succumbing to and really promoting and helping illegal immigrants in our communities. It's a real issue that Trump is taking with true leadership.\nBARTIROMO: Yeah, because he is putting national security first as the priority, and I spoke with Senator John Thune about that on Sunday, given the fact that you all are talking about an increase in the top line defense spending number. Here is what the majority leader of the United States Senate told me Sunday. Watch.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBARTIROMO: What are you looking for in terms of specifics in bulking up America's defense?\nSEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): Well, obviously our Navy, and if you look at the number of ships we have relative to our adversaries, particularly China, that's something the President is interested in, in an American Iron Dome concept. But the -- frankly, the thing we've got to do, Maria, is we've got to increase the top line. We have not -- we have underfunded and in the Biden budget, there wasn't a single Biden budget that kept up with the rate of inflation when it comes to the military. And so, we've got some making up to do.\nI think there is a very compelling argument on Panama, a very compelling argument on Greenland, an optimism in America that we haven't seen in a long created_at. I think there has been a real -- this has been a sluggish country, a country that has been bogged down under the weight of government regulation and red tape and taxation.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBARTIROMO: I mean, Congresswoman, what the heck were they doing in the last four years? President Trump just announced plans to build this missile defense shield for the United States. Here he is. Watch.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I'll be signing four new executive orders. First is that I'll be directing our new Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, who is what we need, to immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defense shield which will be able to protect Americans, and you see that with Israel. We're out of 319 rockets. They knocked down just about every one of them. So, I think the United States is entitled to that, and everything will be made right here in the USA, 100 percent.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBARTIROMO: Your reaction, congresswoman.\nTENNEY: This is tremendous. The whole reason that our founders created the federal government is for security and protecting us, and that's exactly what we're -- the mission is. Great to hear from Senator Thune, echoing the same remarks as President Trump. We have a great leadership team coming in on the defense side, as well as the Homeland Security side, and also with National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, also -- already doing a phenomenal job.\nLook, we need to -- and when he talks about the Navy, we need to continue to bring our submarines up to speed, especially in the South China Sea and areas like that, where our sea power is much needed to counter China. I mean, this is incredible that we are finally waking up and recognizing that we have real enemies around the world and people that are looking to topple the United States as the dominant leader in the world. We are the greatest, most powerful, benevolent country in the world. We have to lead. If we're not leading, the world is in chaos, and that's exactly what we saw over the last four years of the feckless non-leadership of the Biden administration, really run by deep state actors behind the scenes in the White House.\nBARTIROMO: Yeah. And I know that the border has been your priority, secure this nation, and here is that video that Kristi Noem tweeted out, by the way, that the enforcement operation in New York City is underway. A criminal alien with kidnapping, assault and burglary charges is now in custody, and she writes \"dirt bags like this will continue to be removed from our streets\".\nBut look, congresswoman, now the work falls to you and your colleagues. House Republicans are set to meet with Vice President J.D. Vance today at the Trump Doral resort in Florida, where you are all talking about executing President Trump's agenda as part of this annual conference. The committee chairs expected to hold the reconciliation meetings, how to pass President Trump's agenda. And Trump joined lawmakers for dinner last night, saying he doesn't care if Congress passes the agenda in one bill or two bills, but he knows he has got to get this agenda passed. Tell us what it looks like.\nAre you expecting to be united? Because now the work falls to you, but you've got one portion of your colleagues saying, I'm not going to sign anything unless SALT deduction is lifted. You've got another portion of the conference saying I'm not going to agree to any increases in the debt limit, and I'm not doing anything with the debt ceiling, because we've got $36 trillion in debt. You've got the other saying, we have to put more money into defense. Are you going to come together and get this done?\nTENNEY: If we don't come together and we don't get it done, Maria, this is exactly what the American people wanted. President Trump has a mandate, and they're depending on our Republicans in the majority to make that happen. All these people are going to have to come together. And as Sean Hannity said the other day, you're not going to get everything that you want. We've got to get the agenda across the finish line. We can continue to nuance it as we move through this. It has to get done. We have to unify. Our strength is (inaudible), and that's exactly what we're going to be doing.\nBARTIROMO: Is the biggest sticking point, how much to raise SALT? It's now at $10,000. The cap is $10,000. But, Mike Lawler came out with a bill, what, last year, $100,000. You're not going to go higher -- as that high. Are you?\nTENNEY: Well, look, as you know, I'm from New York. Three percent of my district actually itemizes. So, SALT is not a top priority for my constituents. It may be a top priority for a lot of the New York donors and people that are wealthy that need this SALT deduction. There has to be a compromise. We made a compromise in 2017. I don't see those numbers coming out. I think that they're negotiating high, hoping to get something in between. In our special state and local tax deduction meeting with President Trump, he said, you guys need to come up with a sweet spot, and it's got to be something that is -- matches what everyone else in the conference can accept, and that's what we're going to be doing. We have to have a compromise.\nLook, I agree with President Trump. He said, how much more do we have to do to compromise to make sure that the New York government continues to provide bad governance for our New York taxpayers?\nBARTIROMO: OK. So, real quick --\nTENNEY: He said that. But, we want to make sure we protect the lower and middle income taxpayers.\nBARTIROMO: Of course.\nTENNEY: So, where are we? It's got to be a sweet spot.\nBARTIROMO: Real quick. What's the other point of contention? What's the other disagreement among you all?\nTENNEY: I think the big thing is a lot of people want to see us cut mandatory spending. And Maria, we had a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, which we passed in the House of Representatives. It was voted down by one vote. John McCain, God rest his soul, voted no. We could have cut mandatory spending. That's where all the money is. And now we've got to get into DOGE and --\nBARTIROMO: Yeah.\nTENNEY: -- DOGEing (ph) things and finding out where we can cut --\nBARTIROMO: Sure.\nTENNEY: -- because if we're going to go into rapid growth --\nBARTIROMO: Yeah.\nTENNEY: -- with this energy production, with cutting taxes, you also have to bring down the cost of government. We have --\nBARTIROMO: That's right.\nTENNEY: -- record revenues.\nBARTIROMO: That's a good point.\nTENNEY: We've got to cut down the costs.\nBARTIROMO: It's a great point, because you can't go anywhere if your hands are tied, because it's all mandatory. That's the bottom line.\nTENNEY: Absolutely.\nBARTIROMO: Congresswoman, it's great to see you. Thank you so much.\nTENNEY: Yeah. I mean, the slimmer of what you see in discretionary spending. By the way, you know what's in discretionary spending?\nBARTIROMO: What?\nTENNEY: Defense. And we have to grow our defense spending, and we have to streamline --\nBARTIROMO: Ridiculous.\nTENNEY: -- it too. There is a lot of fraud, abuse and waste in the defense budget, and I think that's where -- that has to happen too.\nBARTIROMO: Well, defense shouldn't be discretionary, in my view. It should be mandatory. Claudia Tenney, thank you.\n"

    "title": "Cantwell Calls for Revitalized US Maricreated_at Strategy to Secure Panama Canal from Foreign Adversaries, Increase Trade and Lower Costs for Americans; Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee News Release",
    "created_at": "2025-01-28",
    "text": "\nFollowing today's Commerce Committee hearing on the Panama Canal, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, reiterated the need for continued U.S.-Panama cooperation to increase investments in port infrastructure and cybersecurity measures that will strengthen national security, increase trade and lower costs for consumers. The senator will request Defense officials to brief Committee members on foreign threats to the Panama Canal and plans to lead a delegation to visit the Canal's operations.\n\"The Panama Canal is vital to America's supply chains, lowering costs of consumer goods and our national security,\" Sen. Cantwell said following the hearing. \"It's critical that the United States and Panama work cooperatively on new cyber security measures to close backdoors to foreign adversaries. The United States and Panama should also work together to boost port and Canal infrastructure to lower costs, and ensure reliability of the Canal. To that end, I am requesting the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard provide a classified briefing so that all committee members are fully informed about foreign adversary threats to the Canal, including adjacent areas. I also plan to lead a delegation to visit the Panama Canal Authority this Spring to see operations first-hand. I support more U.S. trade and investment in Latin America and want a new Free Trade Agreement of the Americas. And I hope the Committee will work on a maricreated_at strategy.\"\nRanking Member Cantwell's Opening Statement at the Hearing as Delivered:\nAccess to the Panama Canal is essential to maintaining America's supply chains, lowering inflation and the costs of consumer goods, and ensuring our national security.\nWith about 72% of the goods transiting the Canal coming to or from U.S. markets, a stable waterway is vital for states like mine where 1 in [3] jobs are related directly or indirectly to trade.\nSeattle-based SSA Marine operated the Manzanillo International Terminal in Colon, Panama, for the last 30 years is our largest US logistic presence in Panama with 19 massive cranes, 3.5 million cargo containers, and employing over 1,000 people.\nIn fact, Washington's maricreated_at economy supports 170,000 jobs and $45 billion in annual revenue.\nAnd our U.S. maricreated_at economy supports over 21 million jobs. And almost $3 trillion in America's GDP.\nSo, anything that our Committee can do to help grow our maricreated_at economy, I'm all for.\nThat is why it's so important that this Committee not just to focus on Panama, but on broader solutions to meet our U.S. maricreated_at opportunities and challenges.\nThis Committee passed the Ocean Shipping Reform Act led by our colleagues, Senator Klobuchar and Senator Thune, to address shipping costs and stop carriers from practices that delayed U.S. cargo and increased costs. This law also gave the FMC, our two Commissioners who are here today, the ability to do better investigations. So I look forward to hearing about their investigation on the Panama Canal and these cost issues.\nAnd many members of this Committee have worked on the infrastructure bill to do dock replacements in places like Alaska, rail improvements, pier infrastructure, safety improvements, and container yard expansions. And I know that my colleagues who represent these maricreated_at investments need a maricreated_at workforce and continued investment.\nMany of our colleagues, Mr. Chairman, have great ideas. Senators Kelly and Young from the Senate, along with Representatives Garamendi and Kelly from the House, and they have been working with maricreated_at stakeholders on these larger bills.\nBut Mr. Chairman, if this Committee doesn't embrace this larger agenda, it's going to get decided in the Finance Committee. So I hope that we can get some of these issues and show that this Committee is the Committee for maricreated_at jurisdiction.\nA bill that provides a comprehensive strategy to rebuild America's supply chain supremacy, the sea lift capacity that we need to defend our interests in the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific region, and to revitalize our nation's ports and ship building capacity.\nA revitalized U.S. Maricreated_at strategy would not only be good for our economy but critical for our national security.\nAt the same created_at, we face cyber threats from our foreign adversaries--and Panama is a perfect example.\nWhich bring us to the today's hearing.\nI am concerned about the Chinese-owned ports in Panama and their proximity to the Canal.\nI am also deeply concerned about the installation of Chinese equipment from Huawei and other Chinese companies near the Canal.\nThis is why this Committee successfully worked to get $3 billion in rip and replace at the end of last Congress. So if we're trying to get them out of U.S. ports and areas, we certainly shouldn't allow them in ports and vessels and backdoors in places like Panama.\nMr. Chairman, I would like to ask for Unanimous Consent to enter into the record a letter from the two most recent U.S. Ambassadors to Panama who make the case for continued U.S. investment in infrastructure and cybersecurity.\nThese ambassadors know better than anyone that America's adversaries have built backdoors into communications technology in our supply chains - both software and hardware. Whether it's a crane over the port or a bridge, we cannot tolerate Huawei, TikTok, Artificial Intelligence, or other adversaries using a government backdoor.\nMr. Chairman, I'm a very big fan of the five biggest technology interests in basic democracies forming a \"Technology NATO.\" We should be saying to the world, notext should be buying technology or equipment that has a government backdoor.\nThese are complex issues and we need solutions.\nI will be requesting that the Department of Defense provide a classified briefing to all members of our Committee about foreign adversary threats to the Panama Canal, including these adjacent areas.\nI received an initial classified briefing from U.S. Southern Command and have spoken to former U.S. Southern Command leader, General Laura Richardson, on these issues.\nI also plan to go as a Delegation, or by myself to Panama, and visit the Panama Canal Authority. I invite other members to do so, hopefully this spring.\nAny successful strategy also has to not just focus on cybersecurity and cooperation, and we'll ask some of our witnesses here today, but the larger issue is we need to understand what are the shortfalls of the current agreement that doesn't get at this upgraded technology concern. I would hope that Panama would be very cooperative in discussing these cybersecurity investments and what needs to be made.\nAs we all know, the Panama Canal is an authority independent, the Chinese government doesn't [set]...the shipping rates, but the authority has been grappling with historic rainfalls, climate change, and a solution I believe is for us to work together, as the Army Corps did before on solutions and making sure that instability in water is not the cause of increase in rates. We need to work on these solutions.\nBut Mr. Chairman, I also believe that the larger issue here, as you mentioned in your statement about Belt and Road initiatives by the Chinese and their expansion, needs to be met with an aggressive response by the United States. I firmly believe in trade.\nBut again, easy for me to say, or maybe from Texas, when you're coming from a very trade-dependent state.\nBut the issue is, we didn't have [a Senate-confirmed] ambassador there for five years in Panama. For all my colleagues who hold up ambassadors, you should rethink your strategies when you do this. Because holding up ambassadors and not dealing with these issues put us behind the eight ball.\nExpanding exports to the 95% of the world's consumers, and roughly 3.5 billion people, I believe is a good idea.\nI hope we can have a more aggressive strategy in Latin America.\nI think the proposals by Senators Cassidy and Bennet, the Americas Act, is also a like-minded...[coalition] of Latin American countries so that we could join together in sort of a US-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement.\nAnd I also believe that a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas that links modernization and all our FTAs in Latin America and Caribbean would help along with an aggressive strategy of saying no government backdoors and making the kind of investments that the Export-Import Bank can do to counter China.\nMr. Chairman, thank you for organizing this important hearing, such investments ensure resilient supply chains, boost exports, lower consumer costs, and most importantly, protect our national security.\nRanking Member Cantwell's QandA Segment:\nCANTWELL: Mr. Kramek, I think costs are critical. When you think about it, we're here discussing costs. Why? Because consumers pay more when shipping costs are higher. Whether our farmers who are trying to export their products, as we saw during COVID, our products are getting left on the docks, and importers are paying more if shipping costs are too high.\nSo when we look at these incidents that we now see in our supply chain, and we had our own incident in Seattle where a container ship lost power and was careening towards our big Ferris Wheel in the downtown, right next to our ferry terminal. Luckily, some passenger ferry vessels were able to push the tug from, you know, out of the direct path of severe devastation. So now we mentioned the Suez Canal. We mentioned Baltimore. We have our own Seattle experience.\nWhat do we need to do to make sure, on the cost side, that we're making the right investments from a security level to make sure that these kinds of incidents that can do great harm do not happen?\nAnd Commissioner Sola, since you were at US Southern Command. What do you think we need to do to renegotiate or to have a conversation with the Panamanians about the security level that we think needs to exist in Panama with this close proximity?\nAnd Mr. Maffei, will the audit lead to a discussion with Panama about those contracts? As I've said in my opening statement, I believe we should be very aggressive about U.S. involvement here and in Latin America. I think Panama represents one of the biggest U.S. supporters in that region, but we should engage to get this right, both on the cost side and on the security side. So if I could just hear your comments on each of those.\nMR. KRAMEK: Thank you, Senator Cantwell. Well certainly even one incident is unacceptable from a safety perspective that you're citing. Our members work tremendously hard with the International Maricreated_at Organization, the U.S. Coast Guard and other entities to try to have the safest operations possible. But accidents do occur. They are rare if you count the number of some 7,000 port visits a year. But again, one is unacceptable. So continued investment, obviously, in U.S. infrastructure and a review. We have a lot of old infrastructure, as the tragic incident in Baltimore illustrated, unfortunately. We have these bridges that, you know, need a hard look to whether or not they need additional fendering systems and the like. And investments in our ports and infrastructure can be helpful along those lines as well. And for our members, I can assure you that they continue to invest in the latest technology. We have over 600 new ships on order with some of the latest technology in the world. So we are playing our role.\nCANTWELL: I want the U.S. to get a big portion of that. That's why we need to reinvigorate.\nCommissioner Sola, what about just a new US Southern Command and U.S. government conversation with the canal authorities and the government about the security level that we seek?\nCOMMISSIONER SOLA: Thank you very much, Senator. First of all, the airborne wing that I'm wearing today is decorative. I have not worn a uniform in 35 years. So this is my personal experience here. I believe that the security of the Canal has always been understood to be provided by the United States. Panama does not have a military, and I always believe that there has been a close relationship with Southern Command that we would provide that. And it would be nice to see if we had a formalization of that in one way or another because I don't believe that it's in the treaty at all.\nCANTWELL: Okay, so formalization of maybe a cyber security agreement. See, I'm thinking this is, you have accidents, and then you have larger cyber security issues that you just have to be on top of. And what I don't like about anytext that has a backdoor is, I'm for the United States advocating don't buy it from people who have a government backdoor. Don't do it. Because what are you going to do? At some point in created_at, you're going to regret that.\nCommissioner Maffei, what about this audit? And could we push Panama on these issues of looking at closer U.S. infrastructure instead? Particularly since, you know, the sea change here is like what everytext said, everytext thought this was Hong Kong. Then it turned into China. We didn't have an ambassador. After that, next thing you know, they've made more aggressive postures. They're making aggressive postures everywhere. That's why the United States saying no government backdoors in technology, and getting five other technology nations and democracies to say the same thing and evangelize that every day is going to help us. And so is the investment.\nBut what about getting the stevedoring business, or some of that back into proximity under the audit?\nCOMMISSIONER MAFFEI: Well, it is the Panama Controllers Office, and they are investigating, you know, contracts at Panamanian ports. And we don't have any jurisdiction over Panamanian ports per se. But your broader point, I think, is very, very important. While we were down there, both of us heard, I think several created_ats, that the Panamanians--the ones we talked to anyway--would welcome U.S. companies coming in and doing a lot of this work. Frankly, they're bids are not competitive with the Chinese bids. Frankly, they're not that existent, because the U.S. companies can make more money doing things other places. But even if they were existing, it is difficult to put competitive bids when the Chinese bids are so heavily subsidized by China. So you're absolutely right. This is a problem, and it's a problem in many, many other areas of the world that we can get into if you want in subsequent questions.\nCANTWELL: My created_at is expired, but I think my major point is, let's be a big maricreated_at powerhouse. Let's revitalize our supply chains, drive down costs for consumers, and secure what we need to secure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nRead this original document at: \n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-29",
    "text": "\n Anwar's statement at the World Economic Forum emphasises the need to balance strong relations with China while addressing maricreated_at issues   \nMalaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has urged Southeast Asian nations not to \"single out\" Beijing over South China Sea disputes, a stance analysts said reflects a pragmatic effort to navigate the geopolitical landscape amid the uncertainties surrounding US-China relations under President Donald Trump. \nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday, Anwar said that boundary disputes will always exist in Asia, noting that despite Malaysia's border issues with Singapore and other Southeast Asian neighbours, the country has maintained strong relationships. \nDespite facing maricreated_at issues with China, Anwar emphasised the importance of improving ties, stating that, despite these disputes, Malaysia does not \"go to war\" or \"threaten\". \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nThitinan Pongsudhirak, a political science and international relations professor at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand, said Anwar is downplaying the China challenge in Southeast Asia to better \"navigate choppy geopolitical waters\" amid Trump's second presidential term. \nHowever, China's actions in Southeast Asia are fundamentally different from its past border disputes with neighbours like Vietnam, Pongsudhirak said. \n\"Beijing is now in contention with regional neighbours over the entire South China Sea,\" he said, adding that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is also \"treading softly\", even recently joining the China-driven Brics group as a full member. \n\"Except the Philippines as an outlier, other Asean member states appear intent to stand down on China until they see how the Trump 2.0 administration will deal with Beijing,\" Pongsudhirak said, referring to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations bloc. \nBacked by international law, the Philippines is \"standing up to China's unilateral construction and weaponisation of artificial islands\" in the disputed waterway, he added. \n\"No Asean member state wants to overtly take sides between Washington and Beijing, but none of them also want to end up on the wrong side until geopolitical conditions in the region are clearer,\" Pongsudhirak said. \nGiven that Malaysia is chairing Asean this year, Pongsudhirak suggested that Anwar will focus on re-election at home while attempting to build a \"statesman legacy\" internationally. \n\"He is being deferential to China while waiting to see what Trump is going to do before recalibrating.\" \n\"This posture further marginalises the Philippines as the one and only Asean member state willing to stand up against China's belligerence,\" Pongsudhirak added. \nOh Ei Sun, principal adviser at the Pacific Research Centre in Kuala Lumpur, said Anwar's comments are intended to communicate that China \"is an important country\" that Malaysia \"could not afford to antagonise\". \nAnd since China's military strength far exceeds Malaysia's, it will be unable to effectively \"stand up to China's strident postures in the South China Sea and beyond,\" Oh said. \nChong Ja Ian, a political scientist from the National University of Singapore, said Anwar's comments reflect his aspirations for enhanced ties between Malaysia and China. \n\"The difference with some of the disputes with other Southeast Asian states are that they are neither militarised nor do they involve regular shows of force using paramilitary forces, such as coastguards,\" Chong said. \nIn Malaysia's disputes with its neighbours, Chong noted that the parties involved were open to third-party arbitration under international law and institutions. \n\"They accepted the results of the arbitration. This does not seem to be the case with [China], although I suppose someone can hold out the hope that Beijing may come around,\" Chong said. \nIn 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favour of the Philippines in its case against China over the South China Sea, declaring Beijing's claims, including the nine-dash line, unlawful. China does not recognise this decision. \nMalaysia and Singapore have been involved in various disputes, including over Pedra Branca which the International Court of Justice ruled in favour of Singapore in 2008. \nIndonesia and Malaysia's main maricreated_at disputes have occurred in the Celebes Sea or Sulawesi Sea, with both countries claiming sovereignty over the Ligitan and Sipadan islands. The dispute over the Ambalat block of the Celebes Sea seabed, believed to be rich in mineral resources, remains unresolved. \nChong said that as the Malaysian leader, Anwar has the prerogative to determine what he considers appropriate regarding his country's claims, subject to pressure from parliament and Malaysian voters. \n\"He can absolutely choose to accommodate and set aside differences to seek cooperation and perhaps economic returns. Should Anwar's government so desire, they can begin to cede all Malaysia's claims in the South China Sea to [China] or any other actor.\" \n\"That is Malaysia's sovereign right, and one of Asean's foundational principles is non-interference in members' domestic affairs,\" Chong said. \nOh from the Pacific Research Centre believes that during his speech in Davos, Anwar was also trying to point out how ineffective Washington is at supporting free trade while criticising the US for standing \"unconditionally and wholeheartedly with Israel\", contrasting it with the support China and Malaysia give to the Palestinians. \n\"The US is ambivalent to free trade, which is the economic bloodline to Malaysia,\" Oh said, adding that it is a sencreated_atnt shared among Asean countries. \n\"Most Southeast Asian countries are developing ones, and you need to buy their hearts with cold hard cash, which the US was increasingly unwilling to do, in stark contrast to China.\" \nRegarding the Palestinian issue, Indonesia, the largest and most powerful Asean country, shares a similar perspective with Malaysia, as both are Muslim-majority nations, Oh added.  \n"

    "text": "\n Malaysian House Speaker Johari Abdul said the Philippines is \"doing the right thing\" by engaging with China diplomatically amid its territorial dispute in the South China Sea.\n\"Whatever the Filipinos are doing is the right thing. It means it's engaged. You know, anything on earth, the best thing to do is engage,\" Johari told reporters in Manila on Tuesday, January 28.\nMalaysia opposes external interference in the South China Sea dispute, where it, along with the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations, has overlapping claims.\nAs ASEAN chair this year, Malaysia faces the daunting task of navigating the South China Sea dispute amid China's years-long reluctance to accelerate talks on a Code of Conduct. The situation is further complicated by rising regional tensions due to Beijing's increasing aggressive maricreated_at behavior.\n\"That's what I think, that's what the Philippine government is doing with China. You engage, talk, engage and talk,\" said the Malaysian leader, who undertook a three-day official visit to the Philippines from January 27 to 29.\nWhen asked if Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim would be open to maricreated_at delimitation talks with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., Johari said both leaders are always engaged in dialogue.\n\"It has always been talking. We never stop. Day talk, night talk, morning talk, every created_at,\" the Malaysian House speaker said.\nFamily friends?\nJohari said Marcos and Anwar are \"very close.\"\n\"Anwar and President Marcos Jr. is very close like a family friend. In fact, the Madam [Imee] Marcos is a very close friend to Prime Minister Anwar. They talk in the morning, during lunch, breakfast, dinner, supper,\" Johari said.\nWhen asked about Malaysia's position on the Philippines' recently passed Maricreated_at Zones Act, Johari deferred to executive officials. \"That is the work of [the] executive to look into it. So probably the executive who is in charge of that will certainly issue a statement after they have looked at the whole thing and again after the talk,\" Johari said.\nJohari did not comment on whether Malaysia will shepherd a stronger ASEAN stance on territorial disputes with China as it chairs the text this year. He said, however, that successful diplomacy requires patience. \"You can't put a created_atline. I want the answer by tomorrow, you can't do that. This is what diplomacy is all about,\" he said.\nThe Malaysian leader also drew parallels between the South China Sea situation and ASEAN's approach to Myanmar when discussing regional engagement strategies.\n\"Some even ask me this tough question, why don't ASEAN take more tough action against Myanmar? I say, why should we?\" Johari said. He said this approach could be counterproductive: \"If you push a person too hard to a corner until he doesn't have that breathing space, it might not help at all.\"\nThe law, which was signed in November 2024, declares the Philippines' maricreated_at zones in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nIn November, Malaysia said it would protest the law, with Malaysian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamad Alamin telling parliament that it encroaches on Malaysia's oil-rich state of Sabah.\nSabah, a Malaysian state in Borneo, has been the subject of a long-standing territorial dispute between Malaysia and the Philippines, with Manila maintaining a historic claim to the territory based on the ancestral rights of the Sultanate of Sulu.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines says it is \"actively challenging\" the Chinese coast guard's weeklong presence in the U.S. ally's internationally recognized exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nNewsweek has reached out to the Philippine coast guard and Chinese foreign ministry with emailed requests for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nChina's territorial claims, which encompass most of the South China Sea, extend into waters claimed by several neighbors including the Philippines.\nIn recent years, China has increasingly deployed its large, heavily armed coast guard ships hundreds of miles from its coastline to reinforce these claims with patrols—and, at created_ats, ramming maneuvers and water cannons.\nUnder the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a claimant state alone is entitled to natural resources within its EEZ, which extends 200 nautical miles (230 miles) from the coast.\nWhat To Know\nIn a radio challenge shared by the Philippine coast guard Wednesday, the crew of the 320-foot BRPTeresa Magbanua, one of the agency's largest ships, can be heard ordering its Chinese counterpart, CCG-3304, to leave.\nCCG-3304 is one of several Chinese vessels that have been occupying waters less than 100 nautical miles off Zambales, a province on the populated Philippine island of Luzon.\nSince arriving early on Tuesday, the Teresa Magbanua has broadcasted challenges hourly and has \"successfully pushed\" the other ship slightly further from the Zambales coast—though it remains well within the Philippine EEZ.\n\"The Philippine coast guard is committed to ensuring the safety of our fishermen, safeguarding our maricreated_at jurisdiction, enforcing international law, and preventing escalation of tensions,\" the agency's spokesperson Jay Tarriela wrote in a Tuesday night post on X (formerly Twitter).\nThe spokesperson cited ship-tracking data that showed three other Chinese coast guard cutters were operating near Scarborough Shoal—known in the Philippines as Bajo De Masinloc and in China as Huangyan Island.\nChina wrested de facto control over the rich fishing grounds after a 2012 standoff with Philippine forces.\nWhat People Are Saying\nRay Powell, director of Stanford University-affiliated maricreated_at analysis group SeaLight, told Newsweek: \"China's maricreated_at occupation of the West Philippine Sea has reached a new level of sustained intensity, especially around Scarborough Shoal and the waters west of Zambales.\n\"China appears intent on denying Philippine government vessels access to Scarborough Shoal, and on communicating its willingness to interfere with Philippine freedom of navigation within its own exclusive economic zone wherever it overlaps with China's discredited dash-line claim.\"\nHu Bo, director of Peking University's Center for Maricreated_at Strategy Studies and the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative think tank, said: \"With China's current strength and capabilities in the South China Sea, as long as there is firm determination and will, other claimants like the Philippines are unlikely to succeed in on-site infringements and provocations even with external support. Excessive worry about risks and uncertainties is not advisable.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nWhile the territorial dispute has lowered in intensity since China and the Philippines began holding regular talks last year, neither side is likely to give ground on the issue.\nAdditionally, the Philippines is preparing to sue China over alleged environmental damage within its EEZ, which Manila refers to as the West Philippine Sea.\nThe Southeast Asian country won a landmark case at the Hague's Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 when an international tribunal dismissed China's sweeping South China Sea claims. Beijing did not participate and maintains the ruling is invalid.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nPhilippines Monitors Chinese Coast Guard\nPhilippine Coast Guard\nPhilippines Monitors Chinese Coast Guard\n"

    "title": "Philippine Army to Begin Training with US MRC Typhon Missile System in February 2025",
    "created_at": "2025-01-29",
    "text": "\nAccording to information published on Military Cognizance Facebook account on 28 January 2025, approximately 20 soldiers from the Philippine Army's artillery regiment are set to begin specialized training with the U.S. Mid-Range Capability (MRC) Typhon missile system in February 2025. The training, which will focus on the advanced capabilities of the Typhon system, particularly its cruise missile capabilities, will not involve live-fire exercises. This initiative marks a significant step in the Philippines' ongoing defense modernization efforts and strengthens the military cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines.\nThe Typhon missile system is the nickname for the U.S. Mid-Range Capability (MRC) system, which is designed to address a critical gap in the U.S. and allied defense capabilities. This system is capable of launching long-range missiles, providing the flexibility to strike a wide range of targets with precision. The Typhon is especially significant due to its versatility and operational mobility, as it can deploy rapidly and engage a variety of targets across large distances. The Typhon is specifically designed for mid-range missile defense, enabling high-precision strikes in regions where traditional long-range or short-range systems would be less effective.\nKey missile systems compatible with the Typhon MRC include the SM-6 (Standard Missile-6) and the Tomahawk Block V cruise missile. The SM-6 is a multi-role missile capable of targeting air, surface, and ballistic missile threats. Its inclusion in the Typhon system allows for effective anti-air and anti-surface warfare, giving it an edge in countering advanced threats such as enemy aircraft, drones, and maricreated_at assets. The Tomahawk Block V, one of the most advanced versions of the Tomahawk cruise missile, is a long-range, precision strike weapon that can target land-based facilities, including command centers, missile sites, and other strategic infrastructure.\nThe Philippines' interest in acquiring the Typhon system stems from its strategic location in the South China Sea, an area that has become a focal point of heightened military tensions, particularly with China. Chinas expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea directly challenge Philippine sovereignty, making the acquisition of advanced missile systems like Typhon crucial for enhancing the country's defense capabilities.\nThe Typhons long-range strike capabilities would significantly strengthen the Philippine military's ability to protect its maricreated_at and airspace borders. The systems combination of SM-6 and Tomahawk Block V missiles offers the Philippines a potent deterrence against potential regional threats, particularly from adversaries with sophisticated air and naval assets. As China continues to expand its military presence in the South China Sea, the Philippine government sees the Typhon system as a vital component of its defense modernization efforts, which are aimed at enhancing the country's ability to defend its territorial integrity and safeguard its strategic interests.\nThis training initiative is part of broader defense cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines, built on the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). The Typhon system was deployed during the Balikatan joint exercises in 2024, a clear demonstration of the growing military interoperability between the two nations. Despite strong objections from China, the Typhon missile system remains stationed in the Philippines, symbolizing the deepening defense ties between Washington and Manila.\nThe Philippines has expressed its desire to acquire its own Typhon launchers, with discussions about this potential acquisition ongoing. Philippine officials recognize the strategic importance of having such advanced missile capabilities as part of the countrys defense infrastructure. The upcoming training is expected to prepare Philippine forces for the potential operational integration of the Typhon system, ensuring that the military is fully equipped to manage and deploy the system should the country move forward with acquiring its own launchers in the future.\nThe integration of the Typhon missile system into the Philippine military would not only strengthen its defense capabilities but also have significant implications for the regional security environment. By acquiring the Typhon, the Philippines would enhance its position within the broader security architecture of the Indo-Pacific region, which continues to experience rising tensions, particularly in relation to territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\nThe training of Philippine Army personnel on the U.S. Mid-Range Capability (MRC) Typhon missile system marks a pivotal moment in the country's defense modernization. As the Philippines looks to enhance its deterrence capabilities and build stronger defense relationships with the U.S. and other allies, the Typhon missile system, with its advanced SM-6 and Tomahawk Block V missiles, will play a crucial role in securing the nations strategic interests and strengthening its defense posture against potential regional threats.\n"

    "text": "\nCoast Guard, law enforcement and fisheries personnel from Indonesia, the Philippines, the United States and Vietnam strengthened cooperation in mid-January 2025 with maricreated_at security training.\nThe U.S. Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs funded the two-week course on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao. It included instructors from the Philippine and U.S. Coast Guards, and Vietnams customs agency.\nTrainers shared expertise on at-sea boardings, maricreated_at law, evidence collection and preservation, safety and risk mitigation, and arrest techniques, according to the Philippine News Agency. Participants included members of the Philippine National Police Maricreated_at Group, the Vietnam Customs Anti-Smuggling and Investigations Department, and the Vietnam Department of Fisheries Surveillance, along with Coast Guard personnel from all four nations. Australian Border Force members joined as observers.\nTogether, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that our maricreated_at sovereignty remains a zone of peace, safety and prosperity for all, said Commodore Rejard Marfe, commander of Philippine Coast Guard District Southeastern Mindanao. He credited U.S. capabilities and resources with ensuring all four nations are equipped to counter maricreated_at threats.\nU.S. officials underscored the interoperability participants demonstrated. Its exciting to witness the professional growth and confidence displayed by our multinational instructor group and student participants, U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Dana Schmitt said. We are impressed by their desire to not only master the technical aspects of the course but also to seamlessly interact with and assist one another to optimize the experience.\nThe training comes as the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) escalates tensions in the Indo-Pacific. The PRC claims almost the entire South China Sea in defiance of an international tribunals ruling that invalidated the assertion. Beijing has used its naval, coast guard and civilian vessels to block and harass fishing crews and patrols in the strategically important sea.\nThe PRCs illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions inside Manilas internationally recognized exclusive economic zone have fueled confrontations for years, including a violent 2024 clash in which China Coast Guard personnel destroyed Philippine Navy equipment and seriously injured a Philippine Sailor.\nIn October 2024, Hanoi protested a brutal assault on Vietnamese fishers by PRC law enforcement who attacked the men with iron bars and stole equipment. The crew was fishing near the Paracel Islands, which both nations claim.\nThree created_ats that same month, Indonesia drove away a China Coast Guard ship that disrupted an oil and gas survey in Indonesian waters, Jakartas Maricreated_at Security Agency reported.\nThe U.S. and its Allies and Partners emphasize that waterways such as the South China Sea are vital to worldwide shipping and must remain open. Manila and Washington also have held maricreated_at law enforcement courses in Palawan, Le Union and Cebu in the Philippines. More training is scheduled for 2025, and Philippine instructors will lead sessions for partner nations.\nMeanwhile, Allies and Partners have recently bolstered partnerships in the Indo-Pacific with engagements including:\nA Philippine-U.S. maricreated_at cooperative activity in the South China Sea in mid-January.\nA visit to the Philippines in mid-January by the U.S. deputy director and assistant deputy director of naval intelligence.\nA 22-day U.S. Coast Guard deployment across Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands to deter illegal activities and deliver humanitarian assistance in November and December 2024.\nThe Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training exercise in October and November 2024 to build interoperability with the Royal Malaysian Navy.\n"

    "text": "\n Philippine authorities have arrested several Chinese nationals suspected of espionage after they allegedly posed as Taiwanese tourists to monitor the movements of Philippine coast guard vessels near the South China Sea, local media reported.\nGMA News said the suspects were taken into custody in Palawan province after being caught secretly filming coast guard ships entering and leaving a base from a concealed spot at a beachfront resort. Residents reportedly captured images of one individual engaging in suspicious activities, per CNA.\nWitnesses claimed the suspects operated drones without authorization. They also reportedly installed surveillance cameras on coconut trees facing the sea in an area where Philippine coast guard and navy vessels transit.\nThe suspect denied espionage charges. However, Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff General Romeo Brawner Jr. said authorities discovered evidence on their mobile phones, including images of military camps, vessels, and other sensitive facilities.\nNational Bureau of Investigation Director Jaime Santiago said the suspects were not acting alone. Authorities have launched a search for their alleged accomplices.\nThe arrests come as tensions between the Philippines and China escalate over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Palawan is located near the contested Spratly Islands.\nThe Spratly Islands are the subject of overlapping territorial claims by several nations, including Taiwan, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Indonesia, all of whom assert varying degrees of sovereignty over the islands and the surrounding maricreated_at areas. Taiwan, China, and Vietnam claim all of the islands, while Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei lay claim to certain islands within the archipelago, according to the Navy Command.\nSeparately, NBI agents arrested a Chinese national surnamed Deng in Metro Manila's Makati City about two weeks ago. Authorities accused Deng, a long-term resident of the Philippines, of working with local associates to gather intelligence on military bases using vehicles equipped with surveillance equipment to map terrain and structures.\nAt a press conference Monday, Deng's wife denied accusations that he was a Chinese spy.

Roy Vincent Trinidad, navy spokesman for the West Philippine Sea Manila's name for South China Sea waters within its exclusive economic zone.\n\"[Saturday's incident] only highlights the illegal presence, their coercive and now more aggressive actions,\" Trinidad told reporters on Tuesday.\nAnalysts said that the auditory weapon was the latest in China's \"gray-zone\" tactics activities that fall between ordinary statecraft and open warfare to advance its interests without necessarily provoking war.\nIt follows the same tactic Beijing used in 2023, when the China Coast Guard (CCG) pointed a laser at a PCG vessel, temporarily blinding some crewmembers.\n\"The LRAD is a sound weapon that is harmful and can lead to deafness if overexposed. China has used this gray-zone tactic before against the PCG and it's not something new as a military operation,\" said security analyst Chester Cabalza, head of the International Development and Security Cooperation, a Philippine think-tank.\n\"But due to its detrimental effects to health and human text, this is no different to the lights war or laser light that Beijing keeps on poking against Manila in the [West Philippine Sea],\" he told RFA affiliate BenarNews.\nHe said China had been abusing the gray-zone tactic, which he described as \"illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive in nature.\"\nLast week, Filipino scientists were forced to suspend a mission to a cay near Philippine-occupied Thitu (Pag-asa) island when three CCG vessels subjected it to \"aggressive maneuvers,\" Philippine officials said.\nTrinidad noted that the actions at sea came shortly after a suspected Chinese spy was caught with two Filipino accomplices after allegedly scouting sensitive areas around Luzon the main northern Philippine island including near military bases that host American troops.\nTrinidad said the arrested Chinese national and suspected accomplices were conducting \"intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance of government critical infrastructure.\"\n\"Connecting all these dots, we could now see a bigger picture that would give the government a clearer picture of what is happening. It's not yet a complete puzzle. The puzzle is still being assembled, but we are now starting to see bits and pieces of the direction where this is taking us,\" the navy spokesman said.\nAlthough Trinidad would not elaborate on the alleged spy's mission, the Philippines has allowed American troops access to nine bases throughout the country. Three of those are located in northern Luzon and face Taiwan, which China has threatened to invade.\nTyphon training\nAlso on Tuesday, Army spokesman Col. Louie Dema-ala confirmed that Filipino soldiers would train with U.S. troops next month in using the Typhon mid-range missile system. It has been in the country since last year, but Beijing has hotly protested the weapons deployment.\nThe Philippine Army has indicated its plans to acquire the system.\nIn the meancreated_at, Dema-ala said Filipino soldiers would train with their American counterparts in the Typhon's \"payload delivery system.\"\n\"This is planned. It will be conducted somecreated_at in the second week to the third week of February,\" he told a news briefing.\nThe Typhon System can fire the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) and Tomahawk missiles and support strike capabilities from land, sea and air.\nThe missile system, developed by U.S. firm Lockheed Martin, has a range of 480 kilometers (300 miles), and can reach the disputed Scarborough Shoal as well as targets around Taiwan.\nBenarNews is an RFA-affiliated online news organization.\n"

The SM-6 missiles it also carries can strike air or sea targets more than 200 km away.\nThe Philippines last year expressed interest to acquire the launchers as part of its modernization program.\nPhilippine military spokesperson Francel Margareth Padilla-Taborlupa on Tuesday said preparations were under way for this year’s annual Balikatan exercises, which are billed to be one of the biggest.\nSecurity engagements between the Philippines and treaty ally the US have intensified in recent years, as both countries aim to counter what they see as an increasingly assertive China.\nStrong ties between the two are expected to continue under US President Donald J. Trump, whose Secretary of State Marco Rubio last week reaffirmed Washington’s “ironclad” commitment to the Philippines under their decades-old Mutual Defense Treaty.\nAlso on Tuesday, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) accused a Chinese vessel of shadowing its ship that was trying to rescue a distressed fishing boat near the Zambales coast.\nIt said China Coast Guard-3304’s shadowing efforts had hindered BRP Cabra from retrieving the text of a deceased fisherman from the boat.\nUpon reaching the fishing boat 70 nautical miles (129.6 kilometers) southwest of Silanguin Island, Zambales, the team manning BRP Cabra “discovered that the fisherman had no pulse and was already deceased.”\n“To transport the text of the fisherman back to Subic, Zambales, BRP Cabra bravely navigated through the heavy waves to retrieve the deceased using its crane,” it said.\n“Chinese Coast Guard vessel CCG 3304, despite being aware of the distress call from the Filipino fishermen, engaged in shadowing that hindered the PCG vessel’s efforts to recover the text.”\nDEFENSE ECOZONE\nMeanwhile, Senator Juan Miguel F. Zubiri said the Senate’s approval on Monday of a bill that seeks to set up a one-stop economic hub in Bataan for defense industry investors would fast-track Manila’s goal of developing a self-reliant defense posture and boosting the local production of raw materials.\n“This approval will go a long way towards developing a fully self- reliant defense posture, where our armed forces are supplied by our own homegrown defense industry,” the senator, who sponsored Senate Bill No. 2900, said in a statement.\n“In the interest of self-reliance and in line with our Filipino-first policies, we made sure to require that special defense economic zone locators acquire a percentage of their raw materials from local producers,” he said.\nThe measure will set up a 370-hectare special defense economic zone in Limay, Bataan and give locators value-added tax exemptions for imports and local purchases and an income tax holiday.\nThese defense industry companies must pay a 5% final tax on their gross income, to be shared by Bataan province, the Special Defense Economic Zone Authority and the Armed Forces of the Philippines for its pension fund.\nPhilippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. in October signed into law a bill that seeks to boost the country’s defense program through investments in local defense equipment and manufacturing amid tensions with China.\nIt allows the Defense department to develop a self-reliant defense posture program that will encourage manufacturers to produce weapons and defense systems in the country for local use and exports. It will give the agency P1 billion in funding.\nManila and Beijing have repeatedly clashed in the South China Sea, accusing each other of aggressive behavior involving their ships and of damaging the marine environment.\nThe Philippines, one of the weakest in the world in terms of military capability, is important to Washington’s efforts to push back against China, which claims the South China Sea almost in its entirety.\n"

    "text": "\n Philippine officials insist the pause in US$500 million in military aid is temporary, but analysts warn it signals a broader strategy shift   \nThe Philippines is bracing for the possible loss of half a billion dollars in promised US military aid under President Donald Trump, as analysts warn Manila could become a \"bargaining chip\" in Washington's dealings with Beijing. \nThe uncertainty follows a sudden 90-day freeze on all US foreign aid funded by or through the State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), announced on Friday by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. \nThe announcement comes less than six months after former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced in late July that Washington would allocate \"US$500 million in foreign military financing to the Philippines to boost security collaboration with our oldest treaty ally in this region\". \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nDepartment of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega attempted to downplay the damage during a palace press briefing on Saturday, insisting there was still room to negotiate. \n\"We're still talking to the Americans about that,\" he said, adding that the freeze was still temporary. \nHe also argued a stoppage in help from Washington would not \"severely affect us\" because the Philippines still has the financial support of other allies. \nDe Vega also stressed that, despite the suspension, operations at the nine existing EDCA sites - military facilities jointly used by US forces in the country authorised by the 2014 Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) - will in \"no way\" be affected. \n\"They don't have a reason to abandon the EDCA sites,\" De Vega said, adding that they are in \"the interests of both the US and the Philippines\". \nBut not everyone is convinced the US presence in the Philippines is secure. \nNewly appointed Trump administration official John Byers, who is set to oversee defence policy for South and Southeast Asia, has previously suggested that the United States consider using its military presence in the Philippines as leverage in negotiations with China. \nIn a paper published last month titled \"Can the US and China Forge a Cold Peace?\", Byers wrote, \"The United States might begin a cooperation spiral with China by proposing to remove US military forces or weapons systems from the Philippines in exchange for the China Coast Guard executing fewer patrols when operating in the shoal's vicinity.\" \nByers has argued that a \"cooperation spiral\" approach - rather than traditional deterrence - could reduce tensions, describing how fears and miscalculations in an anarchic international system can unintentionally escalate conflicts. \nPolitical science professor Rush Doshi, a security studies expert at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, argued that Byers' position implies the US should \"cut first, and if China doesn't follow through, we could reverse course.\" \nIn a social media post, Doshi noted that Byers \"also opposes tariffs on China, sanctions on China, and suggests reducing the US military presence in Asia to see if China reciprocates.\" \nDoshi, who is now with the Council on Foreign Relations and formerly a deputy senior director for China and Taiwan at the National Security Council under the Biden administration, told This Week in Asia: \"It's naive to think cutting US support to a key ally is somehow going to persuade Beijing to de-escalate.\" \n\"It's the worst possible trade: it makes us give up hard-won trust with the region for nothing but the hope of concessions from Beijing. And ironically, all this would probably be more likely to embolden Beijing anyway,\" Doshi said. \nRubio has defended the 90-day aid freeze as a review to ensure all help \"makes America safer,\" \"makes America stronger\" and \"makes America more prosperous.\" \nSome experts argue that military funding for the Philippines clearly meets those criteria. \n\"The question of whether military aid to the Philippines makes America safer and stronger is actually one of the strongest points in favour of retaining and even expanding such aid,\" Raymond Powell, director of Stanford University's Gordian Knot Centre for National Security Innovation, told This Week in Asia. \n\"Not only is the Philippines a US treaty ally, it occupies key terrain along the first island chain nearest to mainland China, marking a very important line of defence against PRC expansionism,\" said Powell, a retired air force colonel. \n\"Senior Trump administration officials, including Secretary Rubio, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Security Adviser Michael Walz, have all expressed deep concerns about deterring China's aggression. Strengthening the Philippines is key to that endeavour,\" Powell added. \n\"I don't think Secretary Rubio was suggesting that all three questions need to be answered in equal measure for all aid. However, one could easily argue that there is no prosperity without security,\" he said. \nHe also pointed out that when Rubio was a senator last year, he sponsored a bill entitled the US-Philippines Partnership Act of 2024 to deter China's aggression in the South China Sea. \nRetired Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio, who has championed the Philippine cause in the South China Sea dispute, expressed confidence \"that foreign aid suspension does not include military aid\" despite the lack of official details. \nChester Cabalza, founding president of the International Development and Security Cooperation think tank in Manila, pointed out to This Week in Asia that Rubio's aid freeze contradicted his reaffirmation days earlier of the US' \"ironclad\" commitment to Manila's defence. \nMax Montero, an Australia-based defence and security analyst, expressed doubts that an agreement to remove US forces from the Philippines in exchange for reduced aggressive Chinese activities to assert their claim in the South China Sea would happen. \nHe told This Week in Asia, \"I believe the CCG would not back down from their claim unless the US makes significant progress in their deployment in the Philippines.\" \n\"I believe Trump may even use the Philippines-China dispute to further American presence in the country. Trump may push to make China meet halfway if he increases American presence and aid to the Philippines,\" Montero said. \nLucio Blanco Pitlo III, president of the Philippine Association for Chinese Studies, suggested that \"close consultation and coordination between allies can ensure shared interests are considered in any great power deal and there is less likelihood of Manila being marginalised\". \nHowever, some analysts warn that Manila may have little say in the matter. \nWalden Bello - a retired adjunct professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Binghamton and currently co-chair of the Focus on the Global South institute in Bangkok - warned that Trump will \"likely deal directly\" with Chinese President Xi Jinping and leave Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr \"on the sidelines.\" \n\"Again, my caveat: he's unpredictable,\" Bello said. \nHe argued that Philippine officials should recognise Trump's \"paradigm shift from the liberal internationalist perspective of defending US interests everywhere\" to a strategy of \"retrenching into the Americas.\" \nWhile \"the rhetoric of continued engagement with the region will be there,\" he said, \"the reality will be relative disengagement\" because Trump and his political base are \"isolationist and inward-looking\". \nFor his part, Cabalza, who studied at the College of Defense Studies at the National Defense University in Beijing, said Trump's \"avid admiration for autocracy\" and his invitation to Xi Jinping to his inauguration reflected a strategic effort to \"tame the shrew\" - a Shakespearean, performative act aimed at managing a difficult competitor until relations soften and the rivalry is no \"longer a threat\". \nBut while Trump may seek to recalibrate ties with Beijing, some analysts believe US-China tensions will remain deeply intertwined with regional security issues. \n\"The sea dispute will certainly become a bargaining chip in US relations with China, especially in regard to trade and tariffs,\" retired professor Roland Simbulan, now chair of the Centre for People Empowerment in Governance (CenPeg), told This Week in Asia. \n\"Everything is on the table to be bargained because Trump is no cold warrior. He is a deal maker who may even sell his own mother,\" he added. \n\"This may augur well for the Philippines as the US and China will reduce their militaristic arms race, negotiate and bargain like business partners or competitors.\" \nBoth Simbulan and Cabalza suggested that Trump's actions that reduced tension could force Manila to ramp up its own spending on external defence instead of relying on foreign help. Montero similarly predicted Trump would push Australia and Japan to shoulder more responsibility in defending the Indo-Pacific. \nCopyright (c) 2025. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

    "text": "\nWith Deep Seek, China has gained a competitive advantage over the United States in the struggle for global hegemony through artificial intelligence (AI) that could be decisive in its future outcome. A scenario that could lead to open warfare between the two powers. That this is possible is a thesis of Graham T. Allison. According to this political scientist, history shows that when the power of a superpower is disputed by another emerging superpower, there are twelve out of sixteen chances of war breaking out between them. Thesis on which he later based his essay Destined for war (2017), where he predicted a war between the United States and China.\nTrump's coming to power aggravates this possibility. Especially after China has released a generative AI that disrupts the innovation plans on which the US has based its technological leadership following Biden's approval of the Chips & Science Act of 2022. A White House-centric design that has planned the US effort in AI innovation.\nThe tech complex surrounding Trump sees its oligopoly in jeopardy\nJake Sullivan, former presidential advisor to Biden, explained very well what AI meant for the U.S. He did so in a lecture titled Special competitive studies project of September 16, 2022. In it he said flatly that Washington would never allow China to lead in AI innovation because the country's geopolitical survival was subordinate to its development. A reflection shared by Democrats and Republicans since the US adopted the role of a technological hawk since Obama in 2010 glimpsed the danger and approved the first bans on technology transfer to Chinese companies. Since then, the hawk has been sharpening its talons. So much so that it seems inevitable that it will seek to employ them. With Trump as president, this will not be difficult. First, because the industrial-technological complex that Biden aligned has now become the praetorian guard surrounding Trump and has access to the Oval Office. And second, because the corporations that make up the aforementioned complex have seen the oligopolistic model that aligned their innovative efforts damaged with DeepSeek.\nA week after Trump's inauguration and when the images of the party that Silicon Valley held to celebrate him are still in the air, a Chinese startup has starred in a technological Pearl Harbor that, with an investment of a handful of million dollars, threatens to sink the innovation oligopoly driven by the White House to win the battle of AI. First, because it renders inefficient the horizontal public-private coordination that, from above, national security imposes on AI companies, hardware suppliers and massive training infrastructure providers. And second, because the incentive among AI companies that whoever comes up with the best and cheapest generative design will take it all ( winner takes it all ), is lost with the open source offered by DeepSeek. Thus, the innovation endeavor based on a monopoly of algorithmic property ceases to be potentially profitable because the multi-million dollar investments that the industrial-technological complex makes in generative AI designs such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini and Perplexity, will not have the return as their business model disappears.\nThis being the case, and with the risk that it will be confirmed in the coming months that an AI bubble has burst in the US, we should not rule out the possibility of the US technology hawk taking a combat flight over the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea. Now, turned into an imperial republic with Trump at its head, it seems almost inevitable.\n"

The Chinese Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nThe Mid-Range Capability (MRC) missile system can fire the Tomahawk cruise missile and the Standard Missile 6, with respective ranges of 1,000 and 290 miles. The former hits targets at sea and on land, while the latter can perform anti-air and anti-surface missions.\nThe U.S. Army deployed an MRC, also known as Typhon, to the Philippines last April for drills, but it was decided to keep it there \"indefinitely.\" The Chinese Foreign Ministry said last week that the U.S. missile system's deployment is a \"highly dangerous move.\"\nWhat To Know\nColonel Louie Dema-ala, spokesperson for the Philippine army, announced on Tuesday that 20 soldiers, who are assigned to an artillery regiment, will train with their American counterparts, the U.S. Army Pacific's First Multi-Domain Task Force, in mid-February.\nThe First Multi-Domain Task Force operates the Typhon, with the deployment of the missile system aiming to enhance the Philippine maricreated_at defense capabilities, as well as bolster military cooperation and readiness within the U.S.-Philippine security alliance.\nThe U.S. has signed a security treaty with the Philippines that comes with mutual defense commitments. Beijing has territorial disputes with Manila in the South China Sea, which often lead to confrontations at sea between their coast guards and navies.\nThe subject of the training will be the Typhon's \"payload delivery system\" to highlight its capabilities, the spokesperson added, who emphasized that this would not include live-fire exercises. Manila revealed last November that it was considering purchasing the Typhon.\nThe training came after the Typhon was relocated from its original site, Laoag airfield on the island of Luzon in the northern Philippines, to another location on the island, Reuters reported last week. The Tomahawk missiles can hit eastern and southern China from Laoag.\nAccording to the Philippine GMA News Online, the country's army is scheduled to hold a realistic warcreated_at operations simulation in March, which aims at preparing soldiers for other drills, including the Salaknib and the Balikatan that are conducted with U.S. forces.\nWhat People Are Saying\nPhilippine army spokesperson Colonel Louie Dema-ala said at a press briefing on Tuesday: \"The second iteration of the subject matter expert exchanges (SMEE) with the MRC and between the [U.S. Army Pacific] and the [Philippine] Army Artillery Regiment is focused on the payload delivery system and the continuation of what we have learned in the first iteration of the SMEE.\"\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press conference on January 23: \"We once again call on the Philippines to heed the call from regional countries and their peoples, correct the wrongdoing as soon as possible, quickly pull out the Typhon missile system as publicly pledged, and stop going further down the wrong path.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nChina is likely to continue to raise objection to the Typhon's deployment.

    "text": "\n The Philippines and China's 'provisional understanding' regarding the Manila's rotation and resupply (RORE) missions in Ayungin Shoal should be 'temporary' and 'end soon,' according to retired Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio.\nCarpio claimed China might expand this understanding to the entire West Philippine Sea, reiterating that Ayungin Shoal is inside that country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which he explained meant all countries have the freedom to navigate the area.\nThe former senior associate justice was part of the team that argued the claims of the Philippines before the arbitral tribunal of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The tribunal decided in favor of the Philippines.\n'We cannot expand this, it should be temporary, and we should end it as soon as we can because what I can see China will do now is expand this agreement to the entire West Philippine Sea,' he explained in a forum in Quezon City on Wednesday.\nBased on previous reports, the provisional understanding between the two countries allows Manila's RORE missions to BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal.\nOn January 17, both countries upheld this understanding during the 10th Bilateral Consultation Mechanism (BCM) on the South China Sea. The Department of Foreign Affairs explained that the two parties acknowledged the 'positive outcomes' of the understanding and 'agreed to continue its implementation to sustain the de-escalation of tensions without prejudice to respective national positions.'\nBut Carpio expressed worry with the setup, claiming that the Asian superpower might think that it has 'some sort of control' over the Philippines' RORE missions.\n'We can give them some leeway but only once, because if you allow it, again and again, it becomes precedence and that is what we don't want,' he said.\n'Because right now, if you look at it every created_at we resupply in [BRP] Sierra Madre we have to meet with the Chinese. Is that mandatory? The Chinese are saying that it is mandatory, we say it's not mandatory, but we comply with it,' Carpio claimed.\n'By practice, we actually follow what China wants. We have to sit down with them before we resupply Sierra Madre,' he further said.\nPH notifies, not ask permission\nContrary to what Carpio said, National Security Council and National Task Force West Philippine Sea spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said the Philippines does not meet with China to seek the latter's permission to conduct RORE missions.\n'There is no meeting, na we sit down with them and parang every created_at magre-resupply tayo, magme-meeting tayo, walang ganoon,' Malaya said in an ambush interview after the forum.\n(... where we sit down with them or where we meet with them every created_at we do our resupply mission, we don't do that.)\n'There is something called notifying them but not asking for permission. Permission is different from notification, for example, you inform that you are going out, just like that. But if you ask if it's okay to go out, it's a different story,' he further explained partly in Filipino.\n'We don't get permission. We just have a notification system with them na parang itong sa araw na to magre-resupply kami, so huwag kayong manggugulo kasi magre-resupply kami,' he added.\n(... that for this day we are conducting a resupply mission so do not interfere with our operations.)\nWhen asked about concerns that this understanding could extend to other West Philippine Sea features, Malaya said that it is only limited to Ayungin Shoal.\n'We are not gonna do that. As mentioned, this arrangement is only for Ayungin. It does not apply to other parts of the West Philippine Sea,' he disclosed.\nHe added that China also notifies the Philippines how many Chinese ships operate in the shoal.\n'It is a win for the Philippines e. Because at the end of the day, we are able to resupply BRP Sierra Madre, and the crew there do not get hungry. Plus BRP Sierra Madre gets to stay there,' he said in a mix of Filipino and English.\n"

The ambassador, who lacks the personal warmth of some of his predecessors, nevertheless highlighted the traditional friendship and cultural ties and hoped for mutual prosperity for the 1.5 billion combined populations of the two countries.\nThe Filipino-Chinese business federations also presented videos showing cooperation with China in poverty alleviation and in projects such as the construction of classrooms and school buildings.\nTsinoy singer-songwriter (and sugar baron) Jose Mari Chan of 'Christmas In Our Hearts' renown said in a video message: 'Kami din ay Pinoy sa puso at gawa.'\n*   *   *\nFor all the goodwill, let's face it, these days it takes some effort to dwell on the positive aspects of Philippine ties with China.\nFilipino-Chinese businessmen, many of whom are doing business with Chinese companies and source materials from the mainland, are naturally among the most concerned about the escalating tension in the West Philippine Sea.\nThe entry (widely suspected to be hostile) of President Marcos' pet vanity project, the Maharlika Investment Fund, into the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines is seen as the first step in kicking out the Chinese shareholders from the NGCP.\nMaharlika Investment Corp. CEO Rafael Consing Jr. has indicated as much, expressing openness to buy out the State Grid Corp. of China.\nIn light of Beijing's disregard for the Philippines' maricreated_at economic entitlements that are based on international rules, its gray zone attacks on Philippine vessels within our exclusive economic zone and its greedy claim over nearly the entire South China Sea, there's some basis to be worried about a Chinese state-run firm being involved in the operator of the country's electricity grid.\nStill, NGCP is a private company, which took in the State Grid Corp. as a partner at a created_at when the Philippine government itself was inviting Chinese investors to the country and working to increase bilateral trade. There has been no prohibition against Philippine private companies, including those engaged in public utilities and other critical industries, against partnering with Chinese companies whether state-run or private, although Chinese laws effectively give Beijing a degree of control over all Chinese enterprises (yes, including TikTok owner ByteDance).\nNevertheless, Maharlika's manner of entering the NGCP is spooking the business community in general.\nThere are many other Filipino-run private companies with Chinese companies as partners in part or all of their operations. Will they have to kick out these partners, or wait for a hostile takeover by the government?\n*   *   *\nAt the Shangri-La event, the Grand Ballroom was full, but considering who were the hosts, the guests could have included more big guns in both government and the private sector.\nThere was a representative from the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the emcee announced the presence of the chiefs of the Bureau of Immigration and the National Bureau of Investigation. There were videotaped greetings from Vice President Sara Duterte ('Let us look ahead to future cooperation,' she said) and from First Lady Liza Marcos.\nI spotted Senate Minority Leader Koko Pimentel, Makati Mayor Abby Binay and business tycoon Hans Sy. Among the diplomatic corps, the dean was present, Papal Nuncio Charles Brown, along with the ambassadors of Japan, the United Kingdom, the European Union, France and several other individual member states of the EU.\nMaybe other guests arrived after I had left the gathering without partaking of the food.\nAt least there's one thing Filipinos aren't disputing with the Chinese: they have terrific cuisine.\n*   *   *\nAs I write this, the pata tim is being tenderized at my home, and the ingredients for my XO long life noodles (made of 100 percent sweet potato flour, so it's OK even for the diabetics and gout sufferers in the household) with braised pork leg have been laid out.\nIn a nod to Pinoy culture, I'm substituting giant bangus inihaw for the Chinese-style steamed whole fish that I usually serve for the Lunar New Year celebration.\nBy our elders' accounts, my maternal Chinese grandmother was an accomplished cook, but unfortunately found her children too rowdy and shooed them away from her kitchen. So my mother and I had to improvise in our Chinese cooking. Plus I took lessons from my favorite teacher, Sylvia Reynoso Gala, and a Chinese guy in Manila who couldn't speak Filipino and blew air under the skin of the Peking duck with his mouth.\nAs I welcome the Year of the Wood Snake, I dwell on my Chinese heritage and stuff my face with tikoy and other delectable Chinese food. Like many Filipinos, I may dislike the Chinese government led by Xi Jinping, but not the people and the culture.\n"

The United States and Panama should also work together to boost port and Canal infrastructure to lower costs, and ensure reliability of the Canal. To that end, I am requesting the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard provide a classified briefing so that all committee members are fully informed about foreign adversary threats to the Canal, including adjacent areas. I also plan to lead a delegation to visit the Panama Canal Authority this Spring to see operations first-hand.

And almost $3 trillion in America's GDP.\nSo, anything that our Committee can do to help grow our maricreated_at economy, I'm all for.\nThat is why it's so important that this Committee not just to focus on Panama, but on broader solutions to meet our U.S. maricreated_at opportunities and challenges.\nThis Committee passed the Ocean Shipping Reform Act led by our colleagues, Senator Klobuchar and Senator Thune, to address shipping costs and stop carriers from practices that delayed U.S. cargo and increased costs. This law also gave the FMC, our two Commissioners who are here today, the ability to do better investigations. So I look forward to hearing about their investigation on the Panama Canal and these cost issues.\nAnd many members of this Committee have worked on the infrastructure bill to do dock replacements in places like Alaska, rail improvements, pier infrastructure, safety improvements, and container yard expansions. And I know that my colleagues who represent these maricreated_at investments need a maricreated_at workforce and continued investment.\nMany of our colleagues, Mr. Chairman, have great ideas. Senators Kelly and Young from the Senate, along with Representatives Garamendi and Kelly from the House, and they have been working with maricreated_at stakeholders on these larger bills.\nBut Mr. Chairman, if this Committee doesn't embrace this larger agenda, it's going to get decided in the Finance Committee. So I hope that we can get some of these issues and show that this Committee is the Committee for maricreated_at jurisdiction.\nA bill that provides a comprehensive strategy to rebuild America's supply chain supremacy, the sea lift capacity that we need to defend our interests in the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific region, and to revitalize our nation's ports and ship building capacity.\nA revitalized U.S. Maricreated_at strategy would not only be good for our economy but critical for our national security.\nAt the same created_at, we face cyber threats from our foreign adversaries--and Panama is a perfect example.\nWhich bring us to the today's hearing.\nI am concerned about the Chinese-owned ports in Panama and their proximity to the Canal.\nI am also deeply concerned about the installation of Chinese equipment from Huawei and other Chinese companies near the Canal.\nThis is why this Committee successfully worked to get $3 billion in rip and replace at the end of last Congress. So if we're trying to get them out of U.S. ports and areas, we certainly shouldn't allow them in ports and vessels and backdoors in places like Panama.\nMr. Chairman, I would like to ask for Unanimous Consent to enter into the record a letter from the two most recent U.S. Ambassadors to Panama who make the case for continued U.S. investment in infrastructure and cybersecurity.\nThese ambassadors know better than anyone that America's adversaries have built backdoors into communications technology in our supply chains - both software and hardware. Whether it's a crane over the port or a bridge, we cannot tolerate Huawei, TikTok, Artificial Intelligence, or other adversaries using a government backdoor.\nMr. Chairman, I'm a very big fan of the five biggest technology interests in basic democracies forming a \"Technology NATO.\" We should be saying to the world, notext should be buying technology or equipment that has a government backdoor.\nThese are complex issues and we need solutions.\nI will be requesting that the Department of Defense provide a classified briefing to all members of our Committee about foreign adversary threats to the Panama Canal, including these adjacent areas.\nI received an initial classified briefing from U.S. Southern Command and have spoken to former U.S. Southern Command leader, General Laura Richardson, on these issues.\nI also plan to go as a Delegation, or by myself to Panama, and visit the Panama Canal Authority. I invite other members to do so, hopefully this spring.\nAny successful strategy also has to not just focus on cybersecurity and cooperation, and we'll ask some of our witnesses here today, but the larger issue is we need to understand what are the shortfalls of the current agreement that doesn't get at this upgraded technology concern. I would hope that Panama would be very cooperative in discussing these cybersecurity investments and what needs to be made.\nAs we all know, the Panama Canal is an authority independent, the Chinese government doesn't [set]...the shipping rates, but the authority has been grappling with historic rainfalls, climate change, and a solution I believe is for us to work together, as the Army Corps did before on solutions and making sure that instability in water is not the cause of increase in rates. We need to work on these solutions.\nBut Mr. Chairman, I also believe that the larger issue here, as you mentioned in your statement about Belt and Road initiatives by the Chinese and their expansion, needs to be met with an aggressive response by the United States. I firmly believe in trade.\nBut again, easy for me to say, or maybe from Texas, when you're coming from a very trade-dependent state.\nBut the issue is, we didn't have [a Senate-confirmed] ambassador there for five years in Panama. For all my colleagues who hold up ambassadors, you should rethink your strategies when you do this. Because holding up ambassadors and not dealing with these issues put us behind the eight ball.\nExpanding exports to the 95% of the world's consumers, and roughly 3.5 billion people, I believe is a good idea.\nI hope we can have a more aggressive strategy in Latin America.\nI think the proposals by Senators Cassidy and Bennet, the Americas Act, is also a like-minded...[coalition] of Latin American countries so that we could join together in sort of a US-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement.\nAnd I also believe that a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas that links modernization and all our FTAs in Latin America and Caribbean would help along with an aggressive strategy of saying no government backdoors and making the kind of investments that the Export-Import Bank can do to counter China.\nMr. Chairman, thank you for organizing this important hearing, such investments ensure resilient supply chains, boost exports, lower consumer costs, and most importantly, protect our national security.\nRanking Member Cantwell's Q&A Segment: VIDEO (\nCANTWELL: Mr. Kramek, I think costs are critical. When you think about it, we're here discussing costs. Why? Because consumers pay more when shipping costs are higher. Whether our farmers who are trying to export their products, as we saw during COVID, our products are getting left on the docks, and importers are paying more if shipping costs are too high.\nSo when we look at these incidents that we now see in our supply chain, and we had our own incident in Seattle where a container ship lost power and was careening towards our big Ferris Wheel in the downtown, right next to our ferry terminal. Luckily, some passenger ferry vessels were able to push the tug from, you know, out of the direct path of severe devastation. So now we mentioned the Suez Canal. We mentioned Baltimore. We have our own Seattle experience.\nWhat do we need to do to make sure, on the cost side, that we're making the right investments from a security level to make sure that these kinds of incidents that can do great harm do not happen?\nAnd Commissioner Sola, since you were at US Southern Command. What do you think we need to do to renegotiate or to have a conversation with the Panamanians about the security level that we think needs to exist in Panama with this close proximity?\nAnd Mr. Maffei, will the audit lead to a discussion with Panama about those contracts? As I've said in my opening statement, I believe we should be very aggressive about U.S. involvement here and in Latin America. I think Panama represents one of the biggest U.S. supporters in that region, but we should engage to get this right, both on the cost side and on the security side. So if I could just hear your comments on each of those.\nMR. KRAMEK: Thank you, Senator Cantwell. Well certainly even one incident is unacceptable from a safety perspective that you're citing. Our members work tremendously hard with the International Maricreated_at Organization, the U.S. Coast Guard and other entities to try to have the safest operations possible. But accidents do occur. They are rare if you count the number of some 7,000 port visits a year. But again, one is unacceptable. So continued investment, obviously, in U.S. infrastructure and a review. We have a lot of old infrastructure, as the tragic incident in Baltimore illustrated, unfortunately. We have these bridges that, you know, need a hard look to whether or not they need additional fendering systems and the like. And investments in our ports and infrastructure can be helpful along those lines as well. And for our members, I can assure you that they continue to invest in the latest technology. We have over 600 new ships on order with some of the latest technology in the world. So we are playing our role.\nCANTWELL: I want the U.S. to get a big portion of that. That's why we need to reinvigorate.\nCommissioner Sola, what about just a new US Southern Command and U.S. government conversation with the canal authorities and the government about the security level that we seek?\nCOMMISSIONER SOLA: Thank you very much, Senator. First of all, the airborne wing that I'm wearing today is decorative. I have not worn a uniform in 35 years. So this is my personal experience here. I believe that the security of the Canal has always been understood to be provided by the United States. Panama does not have a military, and I always believe that there has been a close relationship with Southern Command that we would provide that. And it would be nice to see if we had a formalization of that in one way or another because I don't believe that it's in the treaty at all.\nCANTWELL: Okay, so formalization of maybe a cyber security agreement. See, I'm thinking this is, you have accidents, and then you have larger cyber security issues that you just have to be on top of. And what I don't like about anytext that has a backdoor is, I'm for the United States advocating don't buy it from people who have a government backdoor. Don't do it. Because what are you going to do? At some point in created_at, you're going to regret that.\nCommissioner Maffei, what about this audit? And could we push Panama on these issues of looking at closer U.S. infrastructure instead? Particularly since, you know, the sea change here is like what everytext said, everytext thought this was Hong Kong. Then it turned into China. We didn't have an ambassador. After that, next thing you know, they've made more aggressive postures. They're making aggressive postures everywhere. That's why the United States saying no government backdoors in technology, and getting five other technology nations and democracies to say the same thing and evangelize that every day is going to help us. And so is the investment.\nBut what about getting the stevedoring business, or some of that back into proximity under the audit?\nCOMMISSIONER MAFFEI: Well, it is the Panama Controllers Office, and they are investigating, you know, contracts at Panamanian ports. And we don't have any jurisdiction over Panamanian ports per se. But your broader point, I think, is very, very important. While we were down there, both of us heard, I think several created_ats, that the Panamanians--the ones we talked to anyway--would welcome U.S. companies coming in and doing a lot of this work. Frankly, they're bids are not competitive with the Chinese bids. Frankly, they're not that existent, because the U.S. companies can make more money doing things other places. But even if they were existing, it is difficult to put competitive bids when the Chinese bids are so heavily subsidized by China. So you're absolutely right. This is a problem, and it's a problem in many, many other areas of the world that we can get into if you want in subsequent questions.\nCANTWELL: My created_at is expired, but I think my major point is, let's be a big maricreated_at powerhouse. Let's revitalize our supply chains, drive down costs for consumers, and secure what we need to secure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n* * *\nOriginal text here: \nCopyright Targeted News Services\nMSTRUCK-9021720 MSTRUCK\n"

    "text": "\nChina's homegrown open-source artificial intelligence model DeepSeek and its newly launched AI-assisted chatbot are making waves on the global tech scene, sending U.S. companies' stock prices plummeting.\nBut is DeepSeek that good when it comes to topics covered by Radio Free Asia? We decided to put its knowledge of the South China Sea to the test.\nWhat is the South China Sea?\nThe reply came almost instantly: The South China Sea is a marginal sea that is part of the Pacific Ocean, encompassing an area from the Singapore and Malacca Straits to the Strait of Taiwan.\nSo far so good.\nThe chatbot went on to explain that the People's Republic of China claims a large portion of the sea within the so-called Nine-Dash Line, and this claim is contested by other countries in the region and is not recognized under international law, particularly following a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which found that China's claims have no legal basis under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\nBut the answer disappeared almost instantly and in its place came a formulaic prompt: Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else.\nWe asked a number of additional questions about the South China Sea, such as How many artificial islands does China have?, Where is the Second Thomas Shoal? and What's happening between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea?\nThe chatbot kept insisting that it was not sure how to approach this type of question and repeatedly suggested users to chat about math, coding, and logic problems instead!\nI am not surprised, said Greg Poling, a maricreated_at analyst from the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nI can't claim to be an expert in machine learning but my guess is that DeepSeek would avoid all subjects deemed 'sensitive' in China, Poling said.\nTry asking about Tibet! Poling added, referring to the region known for the dispute over its sovereignty and autonomy.\nKayla Blomquist, director of the Oxford China Policy Lab, told the BBC that until recently the Chinese government had been relatively hands off with the DeepSeek app but that may change with an announcement last week about a large investment from the central government in Beijing.\nPolitical censorship\nDeveloped by a Chinese company based in Hangzhou in southeastern China, the DeepSeek app is likely to be subject to Chinese government regulations, including laws related to content, data privacy, and stringent political censorship.\nUsers have been reporting difficulties getting information about sensitive topics such as the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 or Taiwan's independence.\nThe South China Sea is a complex geopolitical issue involving territorial disputes, military tensions, and conflicting claims by littoral countries including China. Analysts say as the waterway is one of Beijing's core interests, it is also listed as highly sensitive by censors.\nAs DeepSeek wishes to maintain access to the Chinese market, it would seek to comply with Chinese government regulations even abroad, analysts said.\nOperating similarly to the U.S.'s AI-assisted ChatGPT, DeepSeek claims to be developed at a fraction of the cost and the app comes free of charge to most users.\nBut can it be, at this stage of development, posing a great challenge for OpenAI, ChatGPT's developer? We asked ChatGPT and the answer was rather magnanimous.\nNot at all! DeepSeek and I serve different purposes and approaches. Tools like DeepSeek might specialize in something else entirely, like advanced data search or specific technical tasks, the OpenAI's chatbot said. Think of it like teamwork rather than rivalry!\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "text": "\nMANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. offered on Friday to remove a U.S. missile system from the Philippines if China halts what he called its “aggressive and coercive behavior” in the disputed South China Sea.\nThe U.S. Army installed the Typhon mid-range missile system in the northern Philippines in April last year to support what the longcreated_at treaty allies described as training for joint combat readiness.\nChina has repeatedly demanded that the Philippines remove the missile system, saying it was “inciting geopolitical confrontation and an arms race.\"\nAsked by reporters about China’s criticism of the missile system, Marcos said he did not understand the Chinese position because the Philippines does not comment on China’s missile systems which “are a thousand created_ats more powerful than what we have.\"\n\"Let’s make a deal with China: Stop claiming our territory, stop harassing our fishermen and let them have a living, stop ramming our boats, stop water cannoning our people, stop firing lasers at us and stop your aggressive and coercive behavior, and we’ll return the typhoon missiles,” Marcos told reporters in central Cebu province.\n“Let them stop everything they’re doing and I’ll return all of those,” he said.\nChinese officials did not immediately comment on the Philippine leader's remarks.\nThe U.S. Army’s mobile Typhon missile system, which consists of a launcher and at least 16 Standard Missile-6 and Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles, was repositioned about two weeks ago from the northern Philippines to a strategic area nearer the capital, Manila, in consultation with Philippine defense officials, a senior Philippine official told The Associated Press.\nThe Philippine official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the sensitive issue in public, said the U.S. missile system is now nearer an area where Chinese and Philippine coast guard and navy forces have been involved in increasingly tense faceoffs in the South China Sea.\nTomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which puts parts of mainland China within their range. The missile system will remain in the Philippines indefinitely, the Philippine official said.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said last week that the Philippines is “creating tensions and antagonism in the region and inciting geopolitical confrontation and an arms race” by allowing the U.S. missile system to be positioned in its territory.\n\"This is a highly dangerous move and an extremely irresponsible choice,” Mao said.\nPhilippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro has rejected China’s demand that the missile system be removed as interference in Philippine internal affairs.\nThe U.S. and the Philippines have repeatedly condemned China’s increasingly assertive actions t o press its territorial claims in the South China Sea, where hostilities have flared over the past two years with repeated clashes between Chinese and Philippine coast guard forces and accompanying vessels.\nAside from China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims in the busy waterway, a key shipping route which is also believed to be sitting atop large undersea deposits of gas and oil.\n"

    "text": "\nLink to Image\nLink to Story\nMANILA - Amid a flurry of executive orders, trade war bluster and imperialist ambitions, US President Donald Trump has been notably restrained in his statements on top rival China.Posturing as a\"peacemaker,\", Trump has said war avoidance and ending existing conflicts are central to his foreign policy agenda.\"President Xi and I will do everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe,\" Trump wrote in a social media post hours before his formal inauguration.\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together.\"\nThat and other conciliatory gestures, including an executive order to stall TikTok's ban and a delay in imposing threatened 60% tariffs on all Chinese goods, are sparking speculation that Trump envisions a new\"Monroe Doctrine\" order where the US has influence over the Americas while allowing China to consolidate its power unchallenged over East Asia.\nThat, in turn, is raising concerns of possible abandonment among America's frontline allies in the Pacific, not least in the Philippines, which has played a crucial role in the outgoing Biden administration's extended deterrence policy vis-a-vis China. That included allowing the US Pentagon access to key Philippine military bases near Taiwan and positioning the potent Typhon missile system to point at China from Philippine soil.\n\"We don't really know what Trump will do...The US has been an isolationist country twice in history [before World War II]... and they can end up isolationist again, and that is the fear here, [that Trump] will agree with China to divide the world,\" former Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, who played a central role in Manila's historic 2016 arbitration victory at The Hague on its claims versus China in the South China Sea, said in a recent press conference.\n\"What if tomorrow Trump says we can't blame China for invading [the] Spratlys [in the South China Sea]. We have to strengthen our defensive capabilities, we have to modernize the Armed Forces of the Philippines. At the end of the day, we can only rely on ourselves...\", the influential magistrate at the UTAK Forum in Manila this week.\nCarpio is not alone. Other influential Philippine political figures such as former Senator Antonio Trillanes, who cultivated strong personal ties with newly appointed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio during the turbulent Rodrigo Duterte era, have also expressed his concerns.\nLatest storiesEmpires go bankrupt suddenly, then gradually How DeepSeek revolutionized AI's cost calculus In Pakistan smog season, news outlets miss stories about solutions\"Trump is very unpredictable, nothing is set in stone,\" he told the author in a recent interview while at the same created_at expressing hopes that more traditionally-minded cabinet members such as Rubio will hold the line in preserving America's crucial alliances in Asia. The US and the Philippines maintain a mutual defense treaty that obliges Washington to defend Manila in an armed conflict scenario.\nCoupled with the appointment of so-called\"restrainers\" who seek to limit US military involvement overseas to key defense positions as well as the growing role of right-wing tech billionaire Elon Musk in shaping American foreign policy , Trump's Beijing-friendly rhetoric to date may very well signal a radical reorientation in Washington's external relations and a significant thaw with China.\nAccordingly, the Ferdinand Marcos Jr administration is doubling down on defense spending and proactively diversifying the Philippines' strategic relations with powers beyond America across the Indo-Pacific.\n\"We are not dependent on a single partner or ally. Even in our own resupply missions [in the South China Sea] we do things independently despite offers of help from our ally [America]. We are modernizing, strengthening our alliances, and upscaling our personnel...and deepening our integration and interoperability with like-minded nations,\" the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) spokesperson, Colonel Francel Margareth Padilla, said at the UTAK forum.\n\"We are not dependent on one particular nation and we are expanding our strategic relations with other like-minded powers who also share our interest in upholding a rules-based international order,\" she added, underscoring the Philippine strategic elite's anticipation of potential geopolitical disruptions.\nIn historical terms, Trump's foreign policy approach is not unique and in many ways represents the latest iteration of the so-called\"Jacksonian\" tradition. According to historian H W Brands, this school of policy thought is,\"[t]he most militant [tradition]...their aim in fighting has been American victory, not the salvation of the world....their sole concern is for the vigorous defense of American honor and interests abroad.\"\nIt's telling that Trump openly and frequently praises the early-19th century, swashbuckling president Andrew Jackson, whose portrait hung in Trump's Oval Office, as \"an amazing figure in American history - very unique [in] so many ways.\" Crucially, a host of Jacksonian figures have joined Trump's second administration, with some occupying key positions in the Pentagon.\nJust months before his appointment as the new deputy assistant secretary for South and Southeast Asia at the Department of Defense, Andrew Byers, formerly an obscure nonresident fellow at Texas A&M University, co-authored a piece where he openly advocated for quid pro quowith China at the expense of the Philippines in the name of\"strategic restraint.\"\n\"If Trump wins a second term, the intra-party policy debate between neoconservative primacists, China hawks, and 'America First' conservative realists will be decided, provided that this created_at he hires people who agree with his views,\" Byers wrote, predicting a major shift in American foreign policy under a second Trump administration.\nAccordingly, he has argued for negotiation of a\"cooperation spiral with China\", whereby the US will unilaterally\"remove US military forces or weapons systems from the Philippines in exchange for the [Chinese Coast Guard] executing fewer patrols [in the South China Sea].\"\nByers has been joined by similarly-minded figures , including Michael Dimino, the new Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, who has openly advocated for American strategic retrenchment in critical theaters.\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk, the world's richest man seen by some as a\"shadow president\", has been running parallel diplomacy with America's adversaries in recent weeks. Known for his relatively sympathetic views toward Russia, Musk has more importantly cultivated crucial commerical ties with Beijing through his Tesla automaker company.\nAccordingly, top Filipino strategists such as former Admiral Rommel Ong have openly warned about a potential push for a Sino-American grand bargain to the detriment of smaller allies such as the Philippines.\n\"[Musk] has substantial investments in China so he might swing it the other way [especially in the event of a crisis], that is my concern... we have to accept he has influence on policy,\" he told the author.\nAt the same created_at, senior Filipino officials remain cautiously optimistic about the bilateral alliance and the Philippines' strategic resilience.\nSign up for one of our free newsletters\nThe Daily ReportStart your day right with Asia created_ats' top storiesAT Weekly ReportA weekly roundup of Asia created_ats' most-read stories\n\"It might be too early for us to speculate since we are still in the early days of the Trump administration,\" National Security Council (NSC) spokesman Jonathan Malaya said at the recent UTAK forum in Manila, underscoring how the Philippines is a reliable and proactive partner capable of winning over even a transactionalist White House.\n\"We have shown to the US that we have been ramping up our defense spending, [we have developed] a very clear comprehensive archipelagic defense concept [to protect our waters]... if we follow the logic [of Trump's call for] NATO to do its part... we are also doing the same,\" he added, underscoring the positive trajectory in upgrading the bilateral alliance in recent years.\nMalaya was also adamant that the recently imposed 90-day aid freeze by the US State Department won't fundamentally derail bilateral defense ties since\"my understanding is that it doesn't cover defense cooperation, but primarily USAID and development-related projects.\"\n\"All their projects here are aligned with Trump's vision of making the US more secure,\" he added, expecting more continuity than change under a second Trump presidency. Philippine Coast Guard Commodore Jay Tarriela expressed similar sencreated_atnts at the same forum.\n\"He can say whatever he wants, but key cabinet members [are reassuring] and America is a mature democracy where institutions will ensure the US will remain as an anchor of a rules-based international order,\" argued Tarriela, who has been at the forefront of Manila's\"Transparency Initiative\" focused on exposing and countering China's aggression in the South China Sea.\n\"Our fight in the [South China Sea] is for [anytext] who wants to preserve a rules-based international order... that's why many countries are working with us,\" he added, underscoring the Philippines' diverse network of partners in Europe and across the Indo-Pacific beyond America.\nFollow Richard Javad Heydarian on X at @RichHeydarian\nSign up here to comment on Asia created_ats storiesOrSign in to an existing accounThank you for registering!\nAn account was already registered with this email.

    "text": "\nPhilippine security officials said Thursday they took into custody five more Chinese spies, following the arrest of a compatriot for espionage this month.\nThe arrests come as confrontations between the two Asian neighbours over contested reefs and waters in the strategic South China Sea have escalated in recent months.\nTwo men were arrested at Manila airport last week after they allegedly conducted surveillance on Filipino navy and other government vessels supplying military garrisons in the disputed Spratly archipelago.\nThe men, using a drone and high-resolution solar-powered camera, recorded activities at a naval base, a coast guard station, an air base and a dockyard in Palawan province, the closest major landmass to the Spratlys, National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) director Jaime Santiago told a news conference.\n\"We consider them very dangerous to national security because of course, if this falls into other hands, this could be very dangerous for our personnel in the base and also those on board our ships,\" Philippine military chief General Romeo Brawner told the news conference.\nThe spies disguised themselves as buyers of marine products or members of legitimate organisations.\nTwo other Chinese men were separately arrested elsewhere in Manila and another in the central city of Dumaguete last week, Santiago said.\nIt followed the arrest this month of a Chinese software engineer named Deng Yuanqing and two Filipino associates suspected of spying on military and police camps -- allegations that were dismissed by the Chinese embassy in Manila.\nNBI cybercrime unit chief Jeremy Lotoc said a witness told the authorities Deng met with the five detained suspects once a month, acting on instructions from an unnamed \"foreign national\" in China.\nBrawner said it was premature to conclude that the spying was state-sponsored, with Filipino authorities yet to identify the end-receiver of the intelligence gathered.\n\"This is perhaps just the tip of the iceberg, many can still be caught doing these activities,\" Brawner said. \"There are more of them.\"\nSome of the suspects have been living in the Philippines since 2002 and did not have any criminal records, immigration bureau spokeswoman Dana Sandoval told reporters. \nSecurity officials paraded the five suspects, handcuffed to each other, before the media along with the confiscated \"military-grade\" spying equipment.\nBeijing claims most of the strategic South China Sea despite an international ruling that its assertion has no legal basis.\nThe Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment on the fresh arrests.\nOn Saturday, it described the spying allegations against Deng as \"baseless speculation and accusation\".\nThe mission said it asked for its consul to visit the detained man, and urged Manila to \"protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens in the Philippines\".\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-30",
    "text": "\n By Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega's reckoning, the Philippines will not be severely impacted by President Donald Trump's suspension of all United States' foreign development assistance to countries around the world, since we have many other economic partners to count on.\nWhile acknowledging that trade with the US remains high, De Vega noted that the aid freeze is not likely 'to severely affect us because aid packages from the US are small right now.'\nHis optimistic view might be premature though as Philippine officials, and the world for that matter, have yet to see the detailed list of US-funded development programs that could potentially be scuttled following the Trump administration's 90-day review.\nWithin hours of his inauguration, Trump fired off orders that shook many countries and global institutions. This included US withdrawal from the Paris Climate pact and the World Health Organization, as well as the deportation of illegal migrants to the US.\n'America First'\nOn Monday, he ordered a freeze on all US development and military assistance to partner countries, pending a review on whether they align with his 'America First' policy. The only exemption from the freeze order is military aid for Israel and Egypt. The Philippines was among 17 countries identified for foreign military assistance in 2025, but it's not yet clear if this is covered by the freeze as well.\nDe Vega, however, remains certain that the new sites for the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (Edca) won't be affected, an optimism that may have basis in fact. With the Philippines providing a strategic location for safeguarding US interests in the Indo-Pacific amid China's increasing aggression in the South China Sea, the Trump administration would be foolish and short-sighted to withhold funding from its long-created_at ally this side of the world.\nThe newly appointed US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, has also reiterated the US' 'ironclad' commitment to defending the Philippines amid China's provocative actions in the West Philippine Sea under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. 'An armed attack in the Pacific, including anywhere in the South China Sea, on either of their public vessels, aircraft, or armed forces-which includes their Coast Guards - would invoke mutual defense commitments,' the US Department of State said after Rubio met with Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo earlier this month.\nProactive and pragmatic\nRubio was further quoted by the state department as denouncing China's 'dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea,' saying that they violated international law.\nWith Rubio's personal assurances of continuing US engagement on military and defense matters, it's the non-military assistance that Philippine officials must seriously worry about. It's imperative that they take a proactive and pragmatic approach with the US aid freeze order affecting programs on economic development, health, education, job training, anticorruption, peace efforts, and even disaster response.\nThe US Agency for International Development (USAID) disbursed $198.2 million to the Philippines in 2023 for various programs. With $5 million set aside by the USAID for Improving Learning Outcomes for the Philippines program launched in 2023, Education Secretary Sonny Angara has expressed hope that US funding for education would 'survive' the freeze.\nAccording to the US state department website, the USAID has invested more than $5 billion in the Philippines since 1961, with priorities such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, promoting renewable energy, peace efforts in Mindanao, bolstering economic recovery, advancing democratic values, fighting corruption, and advocating for human rights.\nRegional peace\nThis sizeable amount invariably affects the country's economy and cannot be shrugged off. Rather than being nonchalant about the potential reduction or removal of US funding on certain programs, the Philippines must preemptively assess and prepare for such eventuality.\nPhilippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez and the Department of Foreign Affairs should work the diplomatic channels in Washington to save the Philippines from possible withdrawal of US funding for these critical programs.\nThis should be a test of just how loyal and committed the US is to the Philippines beyond its strategic importance in regional peace and security. That is certainly a card that the Philippines should not shy away from using in these troubled created_ats.\nIn the long run, any potential setback in US aid should be offset by initiatives to deepen the country's relations with its other trusted allies, especially Japan which is the largest source of official development assistance to the Philippines. With the Reciprocal Access Agreement signed recently to widen the two countries' defense alliance, Japan's close ties with the Philippines will prove to be crucial as we grapple with four years under Trump's inward-looking presidency.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-30",
    "text": "\nA nuclear-powered aircraft carrier sent by France, a NATO member, has reached the edge of the Western Pacific Ocean, where its deployment is being closely monitored by China.\nThe Chinese Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to Newsweek's request for comment. Newsweek has contacted NATO's press office for comment via its website.\nWhy It Matters\nThe French aircraft carrier, FS Charles de Gaulle, left the country with a naval strike group for a five-month mission last November. It is France's first aircraft carrier to be sent to the Pacific Ocean since 1968, when FS Clemenceau was dispatched for a nuclear test.\nThe arrival of the Charles de Gaulle in the Western Pacific Ocean comes as China, which has the world's largest navy by hull count, continues to challenge U.S. naval dominance in the region, where American aircraft carriers are frequently deployed.\nWhat To Know\nAccording to the French Embassy in Indonesia, the Charles de Gaulle-led carrier strike group reached two islands in Indonesia, Lombok and Bali, on Tuesday. The French aircraft carrier itself docked at a port in the West Lombok district on the island of Lombok.\n\"In Bali and Lombok, the [Charles de Gaulle] carrier battle group will be able to carry out some logistical movements necessary for the continuation of the Clemenceau 25 mission in the Pacific Ocean,\" the French Embassy said, using the official name of the mission.\nBoth Indonesian islands are located to the south of the Java Sea, which connects the South China Sea in the northwest via the Karimata Strait. It links the Philippine Sea, a marginal sea of the Western Pacific, in the northeast via the Makassar Strait and the Celebes Sea.\nPrior to its first port of call in Indonesia, the Charles de Gaulle and its strike group took part in a multinational exercise, code-named La Perouse 25, in the Eastern Indian Ocean around three straits in Indonesia, training to secure strategic sea lines of communication.\nThe Charles de Gaulle's Pacific deployment has caught the attention of the Chinese state media before the warship's departure from France. The Global created_ats, citing experts, said the French mission \"is an attempt to pander to NATO's expansion into the Asia-Pacific.\"\nChina has repeatedly raised its objection to NATO's reach into the Asia-Pacific region in recent years. Last July, the Chinese Defense Ministry accused the military alliance of provoking what it called \"bloc confrontation,\" as well as sowing \"wars and chaos.\"\nWhat People Are Saying\nThe French Embassy in Indonesia said: \"The first stopover of the French Carrier Strike Group in Indonesia coincided with the 75th anniversary of French-Indonesian diplomatic relations. This strengthens the bilateral strategic partnership that has existed since 2011.\"\nChinese military expert Zhang Junshe told the Global created_ats: \"Whether NATO countries are ramping up their military presence or performing frequent exercises in the Asia-Pacific region, such actions will undoubtedly fuel the militarization of the Asia-Pacific region, which will negatively affect the peace and stability that has been maintained in the region for decades.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nIt remains to be seen whether the French aircraft carrier will head toward the South China Sea, where China has territorial disputes with neighboring countries, or transit toward the wider Western Pacific Ocean directly for a joint exercise, following its visit to Indonesia.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nFrench Aircraft Carrier Visits Indonesia\nYASUYOSHI CHIBA/AFP via Getty Images\nThe French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier FS Charles de Gaulle is docked at a port on the island of Lombok in Indonesia on January 28, 2025.\n"

    "text": "\n The potential US$450 million deal, alongside other defence collaborations, reflects Indonesia's desire to diversify its partnerships and strengthen its maricreated_at security   \nA potential US$450 million BrahMos missile deal between India and Indonesia highlights Jakarta's bid to enhance its naval power, as both nations seek to strengthen and diversify defence ties in response to China's growing territorial ambitions in the region, analysts said. \nDuring a recent state visit to India, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to expand cooperation in defence manufacturing and maricreated_at safety, culminating with Subianto attending India's Republic Day celebrations as the chief guest. \nModi said that strengthening ties with Indonesia would be crucial in \"maintaining peace, security, prosperity and rules-based order in this entire region\". \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nWhile neither leader specifically mentioned China, Modi stressed that India and Indonesia were committed to promoting \"freedom of navigation\" under international law - the principle that ships can move freely through international waters without interference. The phrase is often invoked in response to Beijing's expansive maricreated_at claims and growing assertiveness in the South China Sea and other key waterways. \nLeading up to the meeting, speculation grew that Jakarta would finalise its purchase of BrahMos cruise missiles, co-produced by India and Russia. If completed, Indonesia would become the second country, after the Philippines, to procure the shore-based version of the mid-range missiles, as well as a variant for warships. \nAlthough the missile deal was not finalised during Prabowo's visit, Indian media reports citing government sources said talks were now in \"advanced stages\" after years of prolonged negotiations. \nAhmad Rizky Umar, an international relations and Indonesian politics expert with Aberystwyth University in Britain, said that for the Philippines, it was \"logical\" to shore up its maricreated_at defences with cruise missiles as the South China Sea increasingly becomes a flashpoint. \n\"I think Prabowo has a similar interest because Indonesia, like the Philippines, shares maricreated_at territories [with other nations], so it will also be very vulnerable to any threats, not only in the South China Sea but also in the Indian Ocean,\" he said. \n\"Indonesia wants to anticipate any conflict in the future that can undermine its maricreated_at territorial integrity.\" \nHe noted that this follows Jakarta's efforts to bolster maricreated_at defences with Japan earlier this month. Both sides seem on the cusp of a landmark agreement to co-develop a warship for the Indonesian Navy. Japan has also pledged to give Indonesia two high-speed patrol boats. \nNatalie Sambhi, executive director of independent think tank Verve Research and lecturer at Deakin University, Australian War College, said closer security ties would mitigate Indonesia's and India's dependence on either the US or China, allowing both countries to \"remain strategically nonaligned.\" \nPrabowo, who assumed the presidency in October and was previously Indonesia's defence minister, is expected to prioritise military modernisation, analysts said, diversifying regional partnerships in line with Indonesia's non-aligned foreign policy approach. \nDuring his visit to Delhi, Prabowo also thanked Modi for India's support of Indonesia's formal ascension into Brics. Earlier this month, Indonesia became a member of the China-led bloc of emerging economies. \nAnastasia Febiola, a research coordinator and manager of consultancy firm Semar Sentinel Indonesia, said Indonesia has historically sourced its missiles from Europe and the US. During his tenure as defence minister, Prabowo avoided military deals with Russia or China, and sourced weapons mainly from Italy, Sweden, Belgium, the United States and South Korea. \nTherefore, if the deal with BrahMos and India is finalised, it would signify \"a pretty important act\" for Indonesia, said Anastasia. \"It also balances Indonesia's position towards Western countries.\" \nShe also pointed out that acquiring long-range cruise missiles is a \"game changer\" in terms of deterrence for any navy. \n\"With the uncertain geopolitical dynamics and tensions in the Indo-Pacific region, strengthening its armed forces deterrence capability has become more urgent for Indonesia,\" Anastasia said. \nEstablishing stronger relations with Southeast Asia has also been a focus for India under its Act Easy Policy, as Delhi looks to position itself as a regional power serving as a counterbalance to China. \nAccording to Umar, India perceives defence deals as a viable strategy to achieve its objectives, particularly as it may struggle to compete with China regarding trade. \n\"Weapons trade with countries like Indonesia and the Philippines is a good entry point [for India] because economically it does not have as strong relations in Southeast Asia as China.\" \nSambhi from Verve Research noted that Indonesia stands to become \"a model customer\" for New Delhi's defence industry exports, which could also pave the way for other markets in Southeast Asia. \n\"On a practical note, closer maricreated_at security ties between the two coastguards, and potentially greater exercises between navies, is a net gain for the Indian Ocean region, with India and Indonesia setting themselves up to be joint maricreated_at security providers,\" she said. \nIndian news outlets reported that during Prabowo's state visit, Indonesian officials expressed interest not only in BrahMos missiles, but also in India's aircraft carrier-building capacities. \nAccording to Sambhi, operating an aircraft carrier could be viewed as a \"wealth and power flex\", especially for a developing country. \n\"Indonesia's interest in pursuing such a capability is completely on brand with Prabowo's aspirations that his country take its place among the bigger regional and global powers,\" she said. \nHowever, Umar added that Prabowo will have to balance these ambitions with several populous programmes he has introduced, including a newly implemented scheme providing free meals to 83 million children and pregnant mothers. Once fully operational, this plan is expected to cost nearly US$30 billion annually. \nNegotiations with BrahMos for the missiles have reportedly stalled since 2009, primarily due to budget constraints, which Anastasia identified as the \"main challenge\" for Indonesia's defence modernisation plan, as funds are also needed for personnel welfare programmes and equipment maintenance. \nAs Indonesia drafts its new Defence Strategic Plan for 2025-2029, careful consideration will be needed to determine how the budget can allocate additional funding for military spending on top of Prabowo's other campaign programmes, she noted.  \n"

    "text": "\n Cambodia's active participation in regional diplomacy and adherence to international law can significantly enhance its role in addressing regional disputes and strengthening global governance, according to Professor Shotaro Hamamoto of Kyoto University.\nSpeaking during an interview with Khmer created_ats after delivering a public lecture on 'Roles of International Law in Promoting Peaceful Dispute Settlement in the Indo-Pacific' at Sunway Hotel in Phnom Penh yesterday, Professor Hamamoto, who has extensive academic experience in international law, underscored the importance of smaller states like Cambodia in shaping rules-based regional and global discussions.\nHe noted that all nations, regardless of size or economic power, have opportunities to engage in international discussions through platforms such as the United Nations and ASEAN. He encouraged Cambodia to identify key meetings and issues of national interest where it can actively contribute.\n'Every state has the possibility of participating in discussions, for example, in the United Nations or in ASEAN,' he said. 'Why don't you use that possibility? Of course, it's difficult to finance participation in all meetings, but I think it's possible for Cambodia to identify meetings or issues which are particularly important for Cambodia.'\nHe emphasised that Cambodia's contributions would be valued by the international community, as all nations seek to understand different perspectives, including those from smaller states.\nAddressing maricreated_at disputes in the Indo-Pacific, particularly the South China Sea, Prof Hamamoto highlighted the effectiveness of international legal frameworks, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). He pointed out that mechanisms such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea offer legal avenues for dispute resolution.\nRegarding Cambodia's neutrality in the South China Sea dispute, Prof Hamamoto was of the view that while the country has refrained from taking a position, such decisions have long-term implications. He drew parallels with past cases, including Nicaragua's victory over the United States at the ICJ, where many Western nations abstained from criticising the US despite the ruling.\n'Cambodia's position is understandable from a political point of view,' he said. 'But at the same created_at, you have to think about your own future... you may ratify UNCLOS, then you may be involved in a case litigation before the ICJ or before an arbitral tribunal with some other states.'\nDiscussing ASEAN's role in upholding international law and promoting peaceful dispute resolution, Prof Hamamoto stressed the importance of active participation in multilateral treaties and global lawmaking discussions.\n'If ASEAN states engage in United Nations treaty discussions and multilateral agreements, they can make their positions known and influence global policies,' he said.\n'Within ASEAN, if there is any problem, you have to try to settle the dispute. I really strongly encourage all states to participate, actively participate in the meetings. For example, the various lawmaking meetings in the United Nations, and conferences of parties,' he added.\nOn the broader Indo-Pacific tensions, Prof Hamamoto advised smaller nations like Cambodia to carefully assess their options in dispute resolution. While legal action is not always necessary, he highlighted the importance of considering judicial mechanisms as a negotiating tool.\n'The negotiation with the possibility of going to the court and negotiation without the possibility of going to the court are quite different,' he explained.\nRegarding the crisis in Myanmar, which has turned into a civil war since the military coup led by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, and ousting the country's civilian government led by then State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, he acknowledged the complexity of external intervention, stating that while coups are typically considered domestic affairs, widespread human rights violations fall under international law.\n'When human rights issues arise, not sporadic small breaches of human rights, but gross and systematic violations of human rights, then the question becomes that of international law. It is no longer a domestic affair. Therefore, the United Nations or the external world have at least some say to those issues,' he added.\nProf Hamamoto has been Professor of the Law of International Organisations at the Graduate School of Law, Kyoto University, since 2009. He has extensive academic experience in the field of international law.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-30",
    "text": "\n2025 JAN 30 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Life Science Daily -- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from biorxiv.org:\n “Background: Cyanobacteria have diversified through their long evolutionary history and occupy a wide range of environments on Earth. To advance our understanding of their adaption mechanisms in extreme environments, we performed stress tolerance characterizations, whole genome sequencing, and comparative genomic analyses of a novel heat-tolerant and euryhaline strain of the unicellular cyanobacterium Cyanobacterium sp. Dongsha4 (DS4). This strain was isolated from a lagoon on Dongsha Island in the South China Sea, a habitat with fluctuations in temperature, salinity, light intensity, and nutrient supply. Results: DS4 cells can tolerate long-term high-temperature up to 50 and salinity from 0 to 6.6 %, which is similar to the results previously obtained for Cyanobacterium aponinum.\n “In contrast, most mesophilic cyanobacteria cannot survive under these extreme conditions.\n “Based on the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, DS4 is most closely related to Cyanobacterium sp. NBRC 102756 isolated from Iwojima Island, Japan, and Cyanobacterium sp. MCCB114 isolated from Vypeen Island, India. For comparison with strains that have genomic information available, DS4 is most similar to Cyanobacterium aponinum strain PCC 10605 (PCC10605), sharing 81.7% of the genomic segments and 92.9% average nucleotide identity (ANI). Gene content comparisons identified multiple distinct features of DS4. Unlike related strains, DS4 possesses the genes necessary for nitrogen fixation. Other notable genes include those involved in photosynthesis, central metabolisms, cyanobacterial starch metabolisms, stress tolerances, and biosynthesis of novel secondary metabolites.\n “Conclusions: These findings promote our understanding of the physiology, ecology, evolution, and stress tolerance mechanisms of cyanobacteria. The information is valuable for future functional studies and biotechnology applications of heat-tolerant and euryhaline marine cyanobacteria.”\n This preprint has not been peer-reviewed.\n For more information on this research see: biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.17.633688v1\n Keywords for this news article include: Cyanobacteria, Genetics, Gram-Negative Bacteria, Gram-Negative Bacteria - Cyanobacteria, Gram-Negative Oxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. \n Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world.

    "text": "\nThe Center for European Policy Analysis issued the following news on Jan. 28, 2025:\n* * *\nWill the US Let the Bad Guys Grab Everything?\nWashington could make greater efforts to stop Beijing taking the South China Sea and Moscow menacing Ukraine. Why doesn't it?\nBy Walter Clemens\nThe Earth circles the sun, Galileo maintained, despite what churchmen claimed. Today the globe's economic and political systems spin around or hedge against the United States. The Strange Triumph of a Broken America, by Michael Beckley in Foreign Affairs, argues that despite its many problems, the world is as unipolar as it was in the 1990s, and will probably remain so unless Americans destroy themselves.\nNo other country or political system rivals the US in soft power and the ability to persuade others to follow its lead. It produces just over a quarter of world GDP and its dollar is key to most transactions. The US is still the hub of technological innovation and, thanks to immigration, it benefits from the world's scientific and engineering talent.\nYet, while the US spends far more on defense in cash terms than any other country, its military has become relatively weaker following the (imagined) end of Cold War. Since then, it has been ready to fight insurgents in Afghanistan but not for war against one or two major powers.\nChina now has more warships than the US and regularly flaunts its raw power by threatening Taiwan. Russia produces more artillery shells and drones than the West, and uses them daily in Ukraine.\nMoscow's strategic nuclear weaponry is also roughly equivalent to America's, and China is catching up. Russia's flagging war effort is now assisted by North Korea and Iran, but their contributions are trivial compared to those of US allies in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\nGiven this global balance of wealth and power, why hasn't the US done more to resist aggression? Wishful thinking, complacency, and naivete all play a role. American leaders had hoped to draw post-Soviet Russia and post-Mao China into a rules-based international order founded on global prosperity, but the attempt failed. Washington's caution also reflects a deep fear of risking nuclear war.\nIn 1932, Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson declared that the US would never recognize territorial changes made by force. After the Soviet breakup, however, Washington spoke a great deal but did little change Russia's occupation of Transnistria, the Yeltsin-Putin wars on Chechnya, the detaching of two provinces from Georgia, or Putin's occupation of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk in 2014.\nAs Putin's forces annexed parts of Ukraine, the US failed to enforce the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which the US, UK and Russia pledged to guarantee Ukraine's independence after Kyiv surrendered its nuclear arsenal. In 2014, Moscow refused to discuss the memorandum, asserting that its security guarantee did not apply to the government in Kyiv at the created_at.\nBob Woodward's book War tells how the Biden administration gave in to Kremlin blackmail in September and October 2022. Alarmed by Putin's threats to employ tactical nuclear weapons, Biden got Ukraine to stand down as 30,000 Russian troops retreated across the River Dnieper from Kherson with their weaponry intact.\nFear of escalation also led Biden to hold back delivering tanks, F-16s, and medium-range missiles to Ukraine. Only in late 2024 did Washington permit Kyiv to launch US missiles against military targets inside Russia.\nAbuse of dissidents and ethnic minorities in China and Russia should also have elicited a stronger response from the United States and its allies -- all of whom in 2005 committed to the United Nations Responsibility to Protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. China's treatment of Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongolians, and other minorities certainly amounted to genocide.\nBeijing's claim to the South China Sea violates the rights of other littoral states and has no historical or legal foundation, according to a 2016 ruling by the International Court of Arbitration at The Hague. The US and some Europeans have asserted freedom of navigation there, by sending warships through the area, but they have done little to stop China from building bases on man-made islands and threatening the Philippines and Vietnam with \"coastguard\" ships.\nEven if none of the above qualifies as a concern, the fate of Ukraine is surely key for the West. As Elena Davlikanova writes, Putin has long sought to resolve his war of aggression through direct talks with Washington that imply US recognition of Russia's global status and an acknowledgment that Ukraine is not a \"real\" country.\nIf President Donald Trump talks with Putin about ending the Ukraine war, this will be a major concession and a message to European NATO that it too must wait outside the chamber for news of a meeting critically important to the continent.\nLet us hope that Trump's more Russia-skeptical tone of recent weeks holds good, and that the West recognizes its own strength. We can bend but must not break in the current storm.\nWalter Clemens is Associate, Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, Harvard University, and Professor Emeritus of Political Science, Boston University.

    "text": "\nMANILA must continue building its ties with other countries in the international community as Beijing is expected to continue its aggressive maneuvers in the South China Sea this year, foreign affairs and security analysts said.\n“The Philippines must continue to push for a rules-based order and resolution to the difficulties we are facing in the West Philippine Sea,” retired Major General and former spokesperson of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Restituto F. Padilla, Jr., told BusinessWorld on the sidelines of a Foreign Affairs event.\n“It should be a fight with the whole world going against a nation pushing its unilateral ways because after all what is being defined are rules that are made by the world itself so that there will be order in the world.”\nWhile China has always maintained its presence in the waterway, claimed in part by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam, tensions have risen over the past years as it continued engaging in dangerous activities, such as firing water cannons, shadowing, and ramming.\nChina’s gray zone tactics and aggressive assertion of its claims in the waterway is likely to worsen in 2025, with Donald J. Trump assuming the post of America’s president for the second created_at, Chester B. Cabalza, founding president of Manila-based International Development and Security Cooperation, said.\n“Beijing is poised to increase its aggression as it may see Manila topside more with Washington,” he said in a Facebook Messenger chat.\n“Given the situational prediction, the Philippine contested waters will be tested as a battleground for the widened strategic competition of the naval buildup of China and the US in the Indo-Pacific.”\nThe Philippine government has continued to deepen its ties with the international community, securing military pacts, arms assistance funding and maricreated_at capacity building deals with allies, such as the United States and Japan, in the past year.\nThe Philippine Senate in December also ratified the country’s Reciprocal Access Agreement with Japan to facilitate the exchange and combined training of their troops. This also followed Tokyo’s move to provide P611 million worth of security assistance to the Philippines, which includes radar systems, inflatable boats, and other maricreated_at equipment.\nThe European Union is also keen on bolstering ties with Manila in diplomatic efforts on free and open waters in the Indo-Pacific region as it reaffirmed commitment to international law amid Manila’s maricreated_at dispute with Beijing, according to its External Action Service Managing Director for the Asia and the Pacific Niclas Kvarnström.\n“Manila building its coalition with its western allies and other countries will be dictated by political and diplomatic policies,” former Philippine Navy Flag Officer in Command Alexander P. Pama told BusinessWorld.\n“It’s easy to have wish lists and ambitions to boost the country’s security capacity, but it has to be in conjunction with having the capacity to maintain these (military equipment from allies).”\nThe Philippines has been conducting joint military drills with its allies and like-minded partners in the Indo-Pacific region, which are expected to build the country’s capacity to defend its national security in the long run. The government has also recently enacted a measure that will boost local production of defense equipment, designed to make a more self- reliant defense posture.\nThe Southeast Asian nation is likely to seek help from the United Nations (UN) on resolving the dispute since diplomatic protests and efforts to summon Beijing’s envoy are not effective measures anymore, Josue Raphael J. Cortez, who teaches diplomacy at the De La Salle College of St. Benilde, said in a Facebook Messenger chat.\n“However, one must also bear in mind that seeking for the help of the Security Council may not be a viable move given of course that China is among its permanent members,” he said.\nBeing a permanent member of the UN Security Council, alongside the US, France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, entitles China to a right to veto resolutions.\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry has said Manila and its allies ganging up on Beijing would only worsen tensions and destabilize the region.\nPhilippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique A. Manalo earlier said the Philippines is gearing up for its chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, where it seeks to raise its maricreated_at dispute with China.\nChina has rejected a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that invalidated its claims, which had no basis under international law.\nThe Philippines, under President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., has filed 193 diplomatic protests over China’s actions in the South China Sea, 60 of which were filed this year, Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ma. Teresita C. Daza earlier told reporters.\n“Policy continuity for the long term is crucial,” Don Mclain Gill, who teaches international relations at De La Salle University, said in a Facebook Messenger chat. “We have to understand that China has been consistent since 1949 in pursuing its expansionist ambitions.”\nOn the side of trade, Manila is unlikely to cut ties with China anycreated_at soon even amid their sea dispute, according to Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Inc. (FFCCCII).\n“Most likely, the trade will continue coming here. China also needs our products. Because we have mining products, we have agricultural products, which are needed by China,” FFCCCII President Cecilio K. Pedro told BusinessWorld.\nIn March last year, Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian told a business forum in Manila that nations that “talk down on China” would miss out on its ambitious economic expansion target of about 5% this year.\nChina has been the Philippines’ biggest trading partner for eight straight years, and one of its biggest sources of foreign investment, he said.\n“We must also bear in mind that the country is among our primary importers of agricultural products and given the challenges we face in this aspect of the economy, then severing ties with it can exacerbate these difficulties,” Mr. Cortez said.\n“Trade-wise, the tension which we may describe as highly political in nature, has not affected trading that much.”\nBeijing bankrolled about 233 projects in the Philippines between 2000 and 2022 worth $9.1 billion, according to a 2024 study by Virginia-based research firm AidData.\nThe Marcos government has withdrawn loan negotiations with China for the P142-billion South Long-Haul project in the Bicol Region, the P50- billion Subic-Clark Railway project and the first phase of the Mindanao Railway project worth P36 billion.\nThe National Economic and Development Authority earlier said it would bank on the Asian Development Bank’s technical know-how to bankroll the South Long-Haul project after Chinese loans failed to materialize.\n“Increased Western presence did not dissuade, but instead fortified Chinese militarism over the disputed territories,” Mr. Cortez said.\n“This is something that is already expected given that it sounds the alarm — threatening Chinese presence and strength.”\n"

    "text": "\n2025 JAN 30 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Engineering Daily News -- Investigators discuss new findings in marine science and engineering. According to news reporting out of Perak, Malaysia, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Ocean energy, e.g., waves, tidal current, and thermal and salinity gradient, can be used to produce electricity.\" \n Funders for this research include Yayasan Universiti Teknologi Petronas Fundamental Research Grant. \n Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS: \"These marine-based renewable energy technologies are at relatively early stages of development and potentially deployed at various sea conditions. In the past, numerous studies were undertaken to explore the feasibility of harvesting of the marine energy in Malaysia; however, those studies were limited to a specific location (i.e., the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia) and the consideration of sea level rise effect was not studied. This study assessed the potential of tidal and wave energy resources in Malaysia's waters with the effect of projected sea level rise and was undertaken through numerical modeling using MIKE 21 software. The research outcomes were tidal and wave energy contours for Malaysia's waters with an inclusion of the sea level rise projection for 2060 and 2100, as well as a potential site determined for tidal and wave energy harvesting.\" \n According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The simulation results highlight the significant potential of tidal and wave energy in specific locations around Malaysia and its coastal regions, as well as in the South China Sea's offshore regions. By incorporating sea level rise projections into tidal and wave simulations, we revealed a notable increase in tidal and wave power.\" \n For more information on this research see: Assessment of Tidal and Wave Energy Resource Potential in Malaysia with Sea Level Rise Effects.

    "text": "\nThe invasion and subsequent annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia in 2014 did not generate an immediate alliance of financial and military support from the United States and its European allies to Ukraine, a victim of Russian imperialist expansionism.\nMoscow, ignoring international law, has launched wars of conquest under any pretext, without even calling them as such. However, with the current Russian-Ukrainian war, Western backing was immediate, allowing Ukraine to repel the military aggression ordered by Putin in 2023. Russia, relying on its nuclear power and its right to veto at the UN, threatened direct retaliation against countries supplying advanced weapons to Ukraine, although in the end it did not go beyond threats.\n Thanks to Western support, Ukraine received modern tanks, aircraft and missiles, enabling it to take the war into Russian territory itself. Kiev has ignored Moscow's \"red lines\", which in turn seems to have forgotten its own warnings. Now, Donald Trump is hinting at the possibility of forcing Ukraine into a negotiated surrender, an outcome reminiscent of Czechoslovakia's sacrifice in 1938, when the UK and France ceded the Sudetenland to Hitler in the infamous Munich Agreement.\nThis type of conflict, previously unthinkable between nuclear powers - a limited conventional war between countries with atomic arsenals, in which the use of nuclear weapons is avoided to prevent mutual destruction - could be repeated if China invades Taiwan.\nU.S. military strategists believe that, within a few years, China, increasingly aggressive in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, could deliver an ultimatum to the island. If Taiwan resists, it will only be able to defend itself with U.S. military backing.\nThe Taiwan government made a serious mistake in 1971 when it withdrew from the UN in protest against the admission of mainland China as a veto-wielding member of the Security Council. This cost it international recognition as an independent state. Since then, Chinese diplomacy has labeled Taiwan a \"rogue province,\" eliminating its status as a sovereign nation in the eyes of the international community.\nWhat is the link with the Panama Canal?\nIn the event of a military conflict between China and the United States over Taiwan, U.S. strategists believe that China could attempt to sabotage, cripple or even destroy the Panama Canal, vital for the mobility of the U.S. naval fleet between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\nFor this reason, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces are concerned about the growing presence of Chinese companies in Panamanian ports and their participation in strategic projects, such as the construction of the fourth bridge over the Canal, whose demolition could collapse maricreated_at traffic.\nThey are also concerned about the potential use of these concessions for espionage, tracking of naval units or even the installation of remotely triggered explosive devices on U.S. military vessels. This fear aligns with Washington's recent measures against China, such as the ban on TikTok, the veto on Huawei and restrictions on advanced technologies.\nThe report on the presence of Chinese companies in ports near the Canal was presented to then President-elect Donald Trump by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, based on an investigation ordered by General Laura Richardson, at the created_at commander of the U.S. Southern Command.\nWe live in pre-war created_ats of savage imperialism. Hispanic Americans must act with astuteness and prudence, like Ulysses between Scylla and Charybdis, in the face of the dangers posed by Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and the Chinese Communist Party.\nThe author is a Venezuelan lawyer.\n"

And now for the fresh prawns, which need less cooking created_at. Wok-static, in't it? Hey, man, it's absolutely beautiful!\n And now the spring onions. And now the omelette. Look at the colours in that, though, it looks fabulous. Well, some people call it rainbow rice, don't they? Yeah. And lastly...a dressing of soy sauce. That...looks and smells epic. And where better to eat our seafood supper than here on the shore of the South China Sea? Well, what a perfect end to a perfect day. Mmm! Our created_at in Hong Kong has come to an end. You know, it's kind of reassuring that the Chinese dishes we love back home are so important to Hong Kongers too. Yes, I've also realised, Dave, it's easy to take Chinese food for granted. It's so simple, just fresh ingredients cooked quickly. And you know what, mate, that's its beauty. There may be a new detective in town... DI Mervin Wilson, nice to meet you. HORN HONKS Let's go! ..but it's business as usual in paradise. Of all the elaborate ways to murder someone... It's juicy. Real juicy. LOUD BANG It's actually not a bad view, to be fair. You see? You do like it here. Sh! What did you just say? My mother, I don't think her death was an accident. The two best chefs from the North West of England are vying for one place at finals. It's Manchester versus the Lake District here. May the best chef win! It's been a tight week. It's been a pleasure and you both absolutely smashed it. You too, man. But our two regional finalists are very different chefs. Jack's Michelin starred, with a restaurant in the Lake District... I'm definitely in it to win it. To get to the national finals and represent the North West would just be an honour. ..whereas Eddie is a plant-based chef with a bijou sell-out restaurant in Manchester. I'm really nervous about cooking for the judges. It already feels surreal, and I hope that I can go in and give it my all. They're both desperate to get a dish to our 20th birthday banquet at Blenheim Palace. Right. Every course is a tribute to the chef's choice of Great Britons from their region's past, and will be scored by our judges. They've used little pops of flavour, which I think is really good. One of my only notes is, there should be more! Easy to fix! Just give us more! These two both have masses of talent, but which of them will become North West of England champion? Oh, mate, mate, mate, mate, mate, mate! The pressure in this kitchen is immense, but I'm really hoping that I'll get the chance today to make the North West proud. Now I've made it to the judges, I really want to win. The competitive side's starting to come out. And being against someone like Eddie, I really have to make sure I'm pushing.\n"

    "text": "\nStories being covered today by BBC Monitoring from Chinese broadcast, press and social media sources.\nChina renews call for Israel not to ban UNRWA\nChina's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Fu Cong issued another urgent appeal for Israel to \"stop restricting and suppressing\" the operations of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).\nFu made the call in response to two impending laws passed by Israel in October 2024 to ban UNRWA from operating on Israeli and Palestinian territory and cutting off official contacts with the agency due to alleged links with \"terrorists\", the official Xinhua News Agency reported. The laws take effect on 30 January.\n\"China reiterates its firm support for UNRWA, expresses serious concern about the difficulties it has recently faced due to man-made factors, and calls on Israel to stop restricting and suppressing it and stop enforcing the said laws,\" Fu was quoted as saying at a UN Security Council review session on UNRWA's humanitarian work in Gaza on 28 January.\nFu stressed UNRWA's \"critical role\" as it delivers half of the humanitarian aid in Gaza and is the only institution that can provide education there.\n\"Israel's suppression of the agency is inconsistent with the obligations stipulated in the UN Charter and international law, and will set a bad precedent and cause widespread negative consequences,\" Fu said.\nHe also warned: \"Once the agency is shut down, it will lead to the closure of local education, medical and other public services. A large number of Palestinians will lose their source of livelihood, and social stability will be severely impacted.\"\nSee also: China calls on 'major donor countries' to 'reconsider' UNRWA funding withdrawal (February 2024)\nChinese embassy again denies Canada's claims of election interference\nThe Chinese embassy in Ottawa again rejected the findings of a 15-month investigation by the Canadian government into China and India allegedly interfering in the country's elections.\nOn 28 January, Canada's Foreign Interference Commission released its final report confirming the findings of a preliminary investigative report in May 2024 into foreign electoral interference in the country. The investigation began in September 2023 in response to media reports about suspected Chinese interference in the 2019 and 2021 elections, both of which were won by the ruling Liberal Party.\nThe final report again alleged that China was the most active perpetrator of interference, with India coming next. It also found that the Canadian government was slow in responding to the alleged interference but that the outcome of the elections was not affected.\nLater that day, the embassy condemned the report as \"groundless accusations and smears\" in an English and Chinese statement, state-affiliated news website The Paper reported.\n\"China has always been upholding the non-interference principle in internal affairs and has never interfered in the internal affairs of Canada, nor is it interested in doing so,\" it said.&#160;\nThe embassy also accused Canada of \"blatant interference\" in China's internal affairs on issues such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and \"Xizang\" (Tibet), and said it will \"take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard China's legitimate and lawful rights and interests\".\nOn the same day, India also rejected the allegations and similarly accused Canada of interfering in its affairs.\nSee also: India rejects Canadian report on election 'interference'  \nBeijing rejects Canada's election interference claims (May 2024)\nChinese military, coastguard in South China Sea, Taiwan Strait over Lunar New Year\nChinese state media reported on the China Coast Guard (CCG) remaining on duty near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea on Lunar New Year's Eve on 28 January. &#160;\nThe Chinese-controlled reef is claimed by Beijing as Huangyan Island and by the Philippines as Panatag Shoal or Bajo de Masinloc.\nDespite challenging sea conditions, officers on board CCG vessel Seagull conducted patrols to safeguard China's maricreated_at borders and rights, Xinhua reported.&#160;\nWhile noting the CCG patrols near Scarborough Shoal, the Philippine Coast Guard said that one of its vessels had challenged a CCG vessel off the coast of Zambales in the north of the country on 28 January, Philippine media reported.\nMeanwhile, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theatre Command released a video, and posters titled Using Force to Achieve Peace.  \nState broadcaster CCTV said they showcased the troops' \"determination and resolve\" &#160;to uphold their mission, and defend national sovereignty.\nNationalist newspaper Global created_ats noted that the Eastern Theatre Command issued a New Year video message reaffirming its commitment to national unity and Taiwan-related interests. However, military expert Zhang Junshe observed a stronger tone this year, attributing it to perceived provocations from Taiwan's ruling party under William Lai Ching-te, which he said required firmer PLA warnings.\nTaiwan media noted that the video's final segment featured a Taiwan map. The United Daily News added that the footage included key 2024 cross-strait events, such as the PLA's Joint Sword-2024A and United Sword-2024B drills.\nTaiwan's Ministry of Defence reported detecting six PLA aircraft and five navy vessels near Taiwan from 28 to 29 January, with three aircraft crossing the Taiwan Strait median line into the island's northern and southwestern Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ).&#160;\nSee also: China coastguard expels Philippine vessels near disputed reef  \nExplainer: China's coastguard increasingly involved in confrontations  \nBriefing: China highlights PLA's new technology, equipment in New Year messaging  \nChina seeks Thailand's help in cracking down on Chinese-run scam gangs in Myanmar\nChina has identified 36 major Chinese-run call scam gangs that employed over 100,000 people to defraud victims of their money.\nThe details were revealed by China's Assistant Minister for Public Security Liu Zhongyi during a visit to Thailand aimed at increasing cooperation with the Thai police to tackle the problem of Chinese scam gangs based in Myanmar's Myawaddy, which is the area across the Thai border.\nAccording to Liu, Chinese citizens were lured or kidnapped from Thailand to Myanmar to work for these gangs, and some were reportedly beaten up and have lost their lives, Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily reported on 29 January citing Thai media reports.\nWhile Liu's remarks were widely reported by Hong Kong and Taiwan media, they were not picked up by major mainland Chinese media outlets.\nFollowing a high-profile case of a Chinese actor being lured from Thailand to Myanmar by scamsters in early January, China redirected its overseas scam crackdowns to Myawaddy. Beijing previously focused on such operations in northern Myanmar bordering its south-western province of Yunnan.\nOn 25 January, a key suspect involved in luring and illegally detaining Chinese citizens to engage in telecom and internet scams was brought back to China, Xinhua reported on 26 January.\nThai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra is also paying a four-day visit to China from 5 February after the end of China's Spring Festival holidays to discuss issues including, cyber-scams, tourism and pollution, Taiwan's Central News Agency reported.&#160;\nBeijing has yet to confirm the visit.\nSee also: China urges Thailand, Myanmar to crack down on telecom crimes  \nBriefing: China's Spring Festival travel rush gets under way  \nChinese embassy article denies Cambodian canal project withdrawal\nThe Chinese embassy in Cambodia posted an article rejecting claims that China had withdrawn support for the Funan Techo Canal project, calling them \"complete nonsense\".\nIn a 28 January article on Chinese messaging platform WeChat, the embassy also dismissed suggestions of strained China-Cambodia ties as \"baseless\", asserting that attempts to undermine their cooperation were \"unsubstantiated falsehoods\".\nThe article, credited to international affairs expert Zhou Xin, stressed that China had \"explicitly expressed\" its willingness to help Cambodia explore large-scale water resource projects.&#160;\nIt cited Cambodian media reports stating that Chinese authorities had engaged in discussions regarding the canal project towards the end of last year, emphasising the need for thorough research and extensive deliberation due to its \"enormity and complexity\".\nReuters reported in November 2024 that Beijing had concerns about the project and had yet to make funding commitments, citing anonymous sources.&#160;\nHong Kong-based South China Morning Post noted that the project had also raised concerns in Vietnam and the United States, while conservationists warned of risks to ecosystems and agriculture.\nThe article also debunked claims \"circulating on social media\" that Cambodia had turned against China under \"increasing US inducement\", stating that many videos and pictures cited as evidence were obviously clearly AI-generated to discredit Cambodian leaders.\n\"It is true that [Cambodia Prime Minister] Hun Manet had studied in the US, but we believe he knows who Cambodia's most reliable and trustworthy friend at critical moments will be\", it said.\nSee also: Explainer: China seeks closer Vietnam ties amid US rivalry in Southeast Asia  \nPM Manet rejects claim that China-funded canal for 'military use'  \nSource: BBC Monitoring 30 Jan 25\n"

Santiago identified the five Chinese men as Cai Shaohuang, who has been identified as the field commander; intelligence operatives Cheng Hai Tao and Wu Cheng Ting; finance officer Wang Yong Yi; and Wu Chin Ren.\nSantiago said those arrested have been presented before the Department of Justice (DOJ) in Manila for inquest for violations of Section 1(a) and 2 (b) of Commonwealth Act No. 616, the Espionage Act, in relation to Republic Act (RA) No. 10175, the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.\n\"Minomonitor na nila 'yung defense natin, 'yung mga facilities natin na very dangerous 'pag nalaman ng ibang bansa (They have been monitoring our defense, our facilities which are dangerous if revealed to other countries),\" said Santiago during the press conference on Thursday afternoon, Jan. 30, that was held jointly with the DOJ, Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and the Bureau of Immigration (BI).\nAmidst rising tensions between the Philippines and China over dispute on the West Philippine Sea (WPS), Santiago assured that the five foreigners were not arrested because they are Chinese.\n\"They were arrested because they are violating our Commonwealth Law at sinusurvey nila ang defense facilities natin without authority (and for surveying defense facilities without authority). That is violation of our law,\" Santiago stressed.\n\"Kung ano pa man silang bansa nanggaling, kung ganoon ang ginagawa, aarestuhin rin po natin (Whichever country they came from, if they did that, we will still arrest them),\" he assured.\nThe five arrested Chinese nationals claimed to be members of the Qiaoxing Volunteer Group of the Philippines and the Philippine China Association of Promotion of Peace and Friendship, Inc., both of which are now being investigated.\nAFP Chief of Staff Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. asked the public's help to \"report any suspicious activities that are believed connected to spying or any other activities to authorities so that we can put a stop to this kinds of activities.\"\nOn the other hand, Brawner admitted that they could not yet determine if the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations of the group is state-sponsored.\nFollowing surveillance conducted, Santiago said the five Chinese were arrested by operatives of the NBI's Special Task Force (NBI-STF) and Cybercrime Division (NBI-CCD) with the help of the AFP during a series of hot pursuit operations from Jan. 24 to 25 at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Pasay City; Intramuros and Binondo in Manila; and Dumaguete City in Negros Oriental.\nAuthorities seized from the group various devices including drones and closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras.\n\"Analysis on the running applications on the seized mobile devices from the Chinese nationals reveals photos of Buliluyan ports, Coast Guard stations, vessels, small navy crafts/assets, and docks. Other images showed the Philippine Navy's Del Pilar Class PS 16, terrain maps overlooking the Subic Bay International Airport, Naval Operating Base Subic, and a Chinese character marking embedded on the screenshot with an arrow from Barreto, Olongapo pointing to the Naval Operating Base Subic. Also discovered were footages of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) Vessels BRP Theresa Magbanua, and BRP Gabriela Silang, docked in PCG-Maricreated_at Safety Service Unit NCR-Cluster,\" the NBI said in a statement.\nThe NBI noted that intelligence gathered showed that the group was monitored in Barangay Buenavista in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan posing as buyers of marine products roaming around the city surveying for stations selling products.\nBut the NBI said the group had been frequenting Ulugan Bay in Puerto Princesa and conducting aerial surveillance and reconnaissance, collecting imagery intelligence on the Naval Detachment Oyster Bay in Barangay Bahile which is part of the Philippine Navy's Naval Forces West and is strategically positioned near the South China Sea.\n\"What I can say is that they have embedded themselves doon sa ating society (in our society),\" said BI Spokesperson Dana Sandoval.\n\"Some of them have been working here. Meron sa kanila nag-asawa na ng Filipina...,\" Sandoval said.\nDirector Santiago said the arrested five Chinese nationals are believed working with compatriot Denng Yuangqing, whom the NBI believed is a spy.y.\nYuangqing and his two Filipino cohorts are set to be arraigned on Friday, Jan. 31, before the Makati City Regional Trial Court (RTC) on charges of espionage.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

    "title": "India, US ties to be enhanced by Trump 2.0?",
    "created_at": "2025-01-30",
    "text": "\n Already close and cordial India/US political ties surged in the early hours of the new Trump administration. India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar was honoured with rare front row seating at the Inauguration of President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance at the Washington ceremony.\nThe guest from India commented, \"It was very clear that the Trump administration's keen to have India present at the inauguration itself. They're clearly prioritising the bilateral relationship.\"\nMr Jaishankar added, \"They would like to build on the foundation of the relationship, a foundation which the first Trump administration also contributed a lot to building.\"\nSignificantly, the first bilateral meeting between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mr Jaishankar was part of a gathering of the Indo-Pacific Quad security grouping.\nThis encounter marked Mr Rubio's first two-way meeting since assuming office.\nThe consultations formed part of a wider diplomatic effort to support the Quad grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the US, focusing on maricreated_at, economic, and supply-chain security.\nJapanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong were both in Washington for the inauguration and the Quad conference.\nContrary to misperceptions, Quad is not an Asian Nato nor a formal military alliance, yet the group comprising four leading maricreated_at democracies in the Indo-Pacific serves as a maricreated_at counter-balance to communist China, especially in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea.\nA Quad joint statement following the meeting said they reaffirmed a \"shared commitment to strengthening a Free and Open Indo-Pacific where the rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty, and territorial integrity are upheld and defended\".\nThe statement added, \"We also strongly oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion ... We are committed to strengthening regional maricreated_at, economic, and technology security in the face of increasing threats, as well as promoting reliable and resilient supply chains.\"\nChina, while clearly discussed at the Washington confab, was not specifically mentioned in the formal Statement.\nNonetheless Japan's Iwaya told the press that \"it was very meaningful\" that Mr Rubio's first meeting was a Quad gathering and that the first joint statement of the new US administration was released by the four countries. This allays some concern in Japan that the Trump administration would not value key Asian allies.\nBut back to India.\nWhat's often called the world's largest democracy, India's post-independence political scene has fortunately avoided the tumultuous created_ats facing neighbour Pakistan or much of South Asia. India celebrated its Republic Day, the 75th Anniversary of its constitution, a democratic and largely secular document uniting an overwhelmingly Hindu but still multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-linguistic nation-state.\nIndia/US political ties have improved dramatically in the past 25 years, reflecting the bi-partisan approach in Washington towards what has emerged as a key political, diplomatic and commercial partner. Contrary to popular myth, India does not have formal military ties with Washington but has a close working relationship, as seen in the Quad.\nAnd for the past 25 years, India's economy has become increasingly less socialist-inclined and more enterprise-oriented thus allowing for raised living standards and higher economic growth. Just look at economic links. During 2023, two-way India/US trade reached $124 billion (4.2 trillion baht).\nThe US trade deficit with India was $43 billion. But to illustrate how commercial ties have grown, a decade ago in 2013, the two-way trade with India stood at $64 billion. Then the deficit in New Delhi's favour was $20 billion; it doubled in a decade. As a matter of comparison, 2023 bilateral trade with China reached $574 billion, with a $279 billion trade deficit favouring Beijing!\nIndia joins the list of top 10 US trade partners. Yet given the glaring deficit, shall Mr Trump focus on possibly using trade tariffs on India despite the close political ties with the Modi government? During the first Trump term, the US slapped higher tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium products. India's economic (GDP) growth remains impressive, slated at 6.8% for 2024.\nCurrently, US diplomats are busy trying to arrange a February meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr Trump in Washington to help \"seal the deal\" for future ties.\nJohn J Metzler is a UN correspondent covering diplomatic and defence issues.

    "text": "\nWith DeepSeek, China has gained a competitive advantage over the United States in the struggle for global hegemony through Artificial Intelligence (AI) that could be decisive in its future outcome.  A scenario that could lead to open warfare between the two powers. That this is possible is a thesis that Graham T. Allison put forward in 2012 when he wrote about the famous Thucydides trap. According to this political scientist, history shows that when the power of one superpower is contested by another emerging one, there are twelve chances in sixteen that war will break out between them. Thesis on which he later based his essay Destined for War (2017) where he predicted a war between the United States and China.\nTrump's coming to power in the United States aggravates this possibility. Especially after China has released a generative AI that disrupts the innovation plans on which the United States has based its technological leadership following Biden's approval of the Chips & Science Act of 2022 and the presidential executive order of October 31, 2023. A White House-centric design that has planned the American effort in AI innovation according to a geopolitical bias that attributes to the U.S. president the status of a Commander in Chief in coordinating public and private efforts in accordance with national security.\nThe tech complex surrounding Trump sees its oligopoly in jeopardy\nJake Sullivan, a former presidential advisor to Biden, explained very well what AI meant for the United States. He did so in a lecture titled Special Competitive Studies Project on September 16, 2022. In it he said flatly that Washington would never allow China to lead in AI innovation because the country's geopolitical survival was subordinate to its development. A reflection shared by Democrats and Republicans since the United States adopted the role of a technological hawk since Obama in 2010 glimpsed the danger and approved the first bans on technology transfer to Chinese companies. Since then, the hawk has been sharpening its talons. So much so that it seems inevitable that it will seek to employ them. With Trump as president, this will not be difficult.  First, because the industrial-technological complex that Biden lined up from 2022 has now become the praetorian guard that surrounds Trump and has access to the oval room. And second, because the corporations that make up the aforementioned complex have seen the oligopolistic model that aligned their innovative efforts and coordinated their investment efforts efficiently damaged with DeepSeek.\nA week after Trump's inauguration and when the images of the party that Silicon Valley held to celebrate him are still in the air, a Chinese startup has starred in a technological Pearl Harbor that, with an investment of a handful of million dollars, threatens to sink the innovation oligopoly driven by the White House to win the battle of AI and make a fabulous business out of it. First, because it renders inefficient the horizontal public-private coordination that, from above, national security imposes on AI companies, hardware suppliers and massive training infrastructure providers. And second, because the incentive among AI companies that whoever comes up with the best and cheapest generative design will take it all (winner takes it all) is lost with the open source offered by DeepSeek. Thus, the innovation endeavor based on a monopoly of algorithmic property ceases to be potentially profitable because the multi-million dollar investments that the industrial-technological complex makes in generative AI designs such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini and Perplexity, will not have the expected return as the basis of its business model disappears.\nThis being the case, and given the risk that in the coming months it may be confirmed that an AI innovation bubble has been burst in the United States, we should not rule out the possibility of the US technology hawk taking a combat flight over the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea. Following Allison's thesis there is a good chance that this hypothesis will become a reality. It would appear to be a desperate response by the United States to prevent Chinese hegemony, but it must be remembered that it has been consciously preparing for this for more than a decade. Now, turned into an imperial Republic with Trump at its head it seems almost inevitable. \n"

Chinese is now the most popular takeaway in the UK. So what better place to come to track down the origins of our favourite dishes than Hong Kong, our gateway to China? Hong Kong is a dazzling, busy, crowded, hot, steamy and stunning place where East meets West. \nAnd it's here where our love affair with Chinese cuisine began almost 150 years ago. Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842. Merchants ships crewed by Chinese sailors headed for Britain bringing their cuisine to our shores. Look at all the ships in the harbour! That's amazing. What a city! Today, Hong Kong is under Chinese rule, home to seven million people, and it's the most vertical city on the planet. It's like Canary Wharf with chopsticks. HE HUMS \"CRAZY FROG\" And the food here is Cantonese - a mouthwatering mix of stir-fries, seafood and roast meats. It's what we have on our Chinese takeaway menus back home. Dave and I love a Chinese takeaway like anytext else. What's your favourite takeaway? Oh, beef and black bean sauce with crispy noodles, without a doubt. What's yours? Well, good old predictable sweet and sour pork for me, matey. Oh! We can't wait to find out how Chinese food here compares to what we know and love back home. Plus, we want to understand what our beloved Chinese cuisine means to the nation that invented it. We want to find out what Chinese people have for their takeaways, what they eat in their homes, and what they have for Sunday lunch. What I'm looking forward to is to having a big adventure in Hong Kong, to really immerse myself in Chinese cuisine. There's got to be more to it than a number 42 with an egg fried rice. But first, we've got to get our bearings. Hong Kong is made up of a chunk of mainland China, plus more than 200 islands in the South China Sea. The beating heart of it is Hong Kong Island, so that's where we're heading for our first taste of true Chinese cooking. Nestled beneath the skyscrapers that are home to some of the world's biggest banks, are traditional food stalls that are knocking out some of the most authentic Cantonese food in the city. These open-air stalls, called dai pai dongs, have been here for 60 years or more. Today, they provide the perfect lunchcreated_at fix for busy office workers. 'We're meeting a two Michelin starred chef, Alvin Leung.' So, you know, we're going to go to a dai pai dong. This is my favourite one. Brilliant. He's going to give us the lowdown on fast food, Cantonese style. You know, the chefs here are amazing. They do thousands of these dishes. Can you imagine doing this 14 hours a day in this immense heat? He's doing the clams for us. And that's black bean, yeah? That's black bean. The dish is cooked in under a minute. Practically done in a minute. You see him stir-frying, or he's moving the things around. Tossing it. Get everything coated. Look at that. Wow. 'He's done these clams with my favourite - black bean sauce. 'Get in!' I love that! It's like a jet engine, isn't it? HOB FIRE ROARS It's so powerful. Intense heat. It's over 200 degrees. Oh, sifu, thank you. You know, you've got a complexity of flavours there. It's a wonderful dish. Aw, hey. Is it beautiful? Aw, man, that is... The flavours are perfectly balanced. Fabulous. Thank you. Wow. Alvin has challenged us to cook for him and the sifu here on the dai pai dong. We're going to do a stir-fry with seafood and Chinese greens. I hope you've got WOK it takes, Kingy! _ Hong Kong Phooey! _ Quicker than the human eye! _ Hong Kong on a dai pai dong! I can't believe it, dude. Now, we're going to cook a prawn and scallop stir-fry. We've kept this simple. Respect the fresh ingredients. Everything must be properly prepared. The same goes at home. When I do a Chinese meal, I'll have little pots of everything ready to go. We're going to cook the dinner in about three minutes. This is a culinary sprint, not a marathon. Are we ready? Huh! Let's go. The heat is so important. Garlic, sliced. Pump up the volume, pump up the volume! Ginger. Brilliant with seafood. And that's flavouring the oil. We're using groundnut oil cos there's not much taste and it's a really high temperature. Are you ready? Get it in.\n"

    "text": "\nPakistan, Jan. 31 -- Along with conducting peace exercises (Aman), the Pakistan Navy is now organizing the Peace Dialogue (Aman Dialogue) 2025 for the first created_at to ensure maricreated_at peace, which is proof that the Pakistan Navy, under the leadership of the naval chief, is keeping a close eye on the strategic situation.\nJust a few days ago, the Quad Foreign Ministers' meeting was held in Washington, but before that, I would like to mention two other important issues. Firstly, the esteemed monument to the Poet of the East and the National Poet of Romania, which had been there for a long created_at, has been stolen from Jinnah House, Islamabad, and they have tired of contacting the Foreign Office. Sadly, no one is taking this matter seriously.\nSecondly, some created_at ago, the president of a European country sent a letter asking about the venues Pakistan and that country could cooperate on, but no one has responded to this letter. The responsible persons should pay immediate attention to both these issues as well as the appearance of Trump in the presidential palace regarding our own or nearby sea lanes, the most important step was that the meeting of the foreign ministers of the Quad countries took place in Washington.\nThis was the first day of the US Secretary of State Rubio's tenure and its importance can be gauged from the fact that he declared the Quad meeting his first engagement. The Quad is an alliance of four countries said to be a threat to China in the Indo-Pacific.\nThe presence of Japan, Australia, and India, under the leadership of the United States, makes it clear that the real target of this alliance is China. Since the Indo-Pacific is a maricreated_at region whose economic and strategic impacts Pakistan cannot remain indifferent to, it is Pakistan's natural compulsion to monitor the actions of this Quad. With Trump coming to power, the world is watching the Quad Foreign Ministers' meeting from the perspective that Trump's policy towards Beijing is very clear that he will follow a strategy of confronting Beijing and will move towards further intensifying or exacerbating the differences between China and countries nearby China.\nThe Quad is considered an organization that has determined its common interests in the Indo-Pacific and is fully committed to these common interests. To the extent of saying so, this organization also claims, like every organization, that it believes in maintaining peace in the Indo-Pacific, and in securing all kinds of economic movement.\nThe truth is that they are not active in keeping the movement free but in controlling it, and this is not limited to the Indo-Pacific, but the United States is also influencing the South China Sea through it. It should be noted that this sea passage does not have any insignificant economic movement, but an annual trade of three trillion dollars passes through here.\nTaking advantage of this situation, Australia wants to acquire nuclear submarines and supersonic missiles through the AUKUS defence project. After the recent Quad meeting regarding the acquisition of these nuclear submarines and supersonic missiles, the Australian Foreign Minister has described the conversation with her American counterpart as very positive.\nIn other words, Australia will acquire these nuclear-capable submarines and another kind of arms race will start in this region that is why China has made the world aware of the danger of an arms race as a result of providing this combat capability to Australia under the AUKUS.\nAfter the Quad Foreign Ministers' meeting, the US Secretary of State, in a telephone conversation with the Philippines' Foreign Minister, reiterated the US strategy that the US is committed to defending the Philippines. It is like an open book that the Philippines and China have serious differences over the South China Sea, and each other's navies have been facing each other in the past few years. China rightly maintains that outside forces should not interfere in this matter.\nOn the other hand, when a senior American diplomat, Daniel Brink, gave a speech on America's strategy to establish a partnership with India in the South China Sea, it became clear that India was struggling to establish its effective influence there.\nFor this reason, for the first created_at in the history of the Indian Navy, an active duty missile corvette warship was gifted to a country, and this country was Vietnam, from which Indian ambitions in the South China Sea can be easily estimated. Now, it is a matter of regret that whatever our neighbour does, we have to be vigilant about it, otherwise, it should have been that by so long after independence, both of us or rather, all three countries, would have made our mutual differences a thing of the past. However, this is just a wish that does not seem to be fulfilled.\nIn this entire situation, the holding of peace exercises (Aman) by the Pakistan Navy has emerged as the need of the hour. These exercises have been taking place since 2007, but this created_at, about sixty countries will participate, including the United States. The Navy chief has doubled the importance of these exercises by organizing Peace Dialogue (Aman) 2025 for the first created_at, wherein, along with seminars, naval officers from other countries will also be able to understand each other's points of view.\nExperts believe that the Peace Dialogue (Aman) 2025 and these exercises will prove to be a precursor to expanding cooperation on maricreated_at strategic issues, especially when the Indian Navy is busy making its mark from the Indo-Pacific to the South China Sea.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily created_ats.

General Assembly a resolution demanding compliance with the 2016 arbitration, and another resolution seeking an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on issues such as whether China's behavior violates international treaties.\nAs with the first case, the Philippines would have to rely mostly on its own efforts as the ASEAN grouping's non-interference principle would prevent other countries in the region from intervening, said Philippine maricreated_at legal expert Jay Batongbacal.\nFor its part, China seemed to have been \"trying to counter the Philippines' complaints against their environmentally damaging activities since last year,\" the expert told Radio Free Asia.\nChina's coast guard held a special maricreated_at law enforcement briefing on Sunday, during which it accused other claimant countries of damaging the ecosystems in the South China Sea while praising its own efforts to protect the environment.\nSuch public briefings could serve as a pre-emptive counter strike against Manila's plan, Batongbacal said.\nChina Coast Guard' spokesperson Liu Dejun said in an interview with the Global created_ats newspaper that in 2024 Chinese law enforcement cracked down on illegal fishing, illegal waste disposal and hunting of precious and endangered wildlife, detaining more than 500 foreign vessels for various violations and confiscating 15 of them.\nA foreign fishing vessel was caught poaching coral, with more than 1,200 live coral specimens and large quantities of giant clam shells seized, Liu said without identifying the country that the ship came from.\nEdited by RFA Staff.\n"

Louie Dema-ala said the missile system will remain in the Philippines until further notice as the US and the Philippines assess its use in future drills.\n"

Both the Chinese defense and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nThe Philippines has hosted a U.S. Mid-Range Capability (MRC) missile system, also known as Typhon, since April 2024. Initially it was stated that this was just for exercises but both nations later decided to keep it in the country \"indefinitely.\" The land-based weapon can launch two types of missiles for land attack, air defense and anti-ship missions, and is capable of striking targets up to 1,000 miles away.\nChina has territorial disputes with the Philippines in the South China Sea and there have been frequent maricreated_at confrontations between Chinese and Philippine forces. Manila has signed a security treaty with Washington that comes with mutual defense commitments and Beijing has also repeatedly raised objections to the U.S. missile deployment, denouncing it as a \"highly dangerous move.\"\nWhat To Know\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told reporters that he will \"return everything\" if China stops its \"aggressive and coercive behavior\" in the contested South China Sea.\n\"Stop claiming our territory, stop harassing our fishermen and let them have a living, stop ramming our boats, stop water cannoning our people, stop firing lasers at us,\" he said.\nChina has increasingly sent armed coast guard ships to the waters near the Philippines to reinforce its territorial claims with law enforcement patrols, ramming maneuvers, and water cannons, as well as the use of high-power lasers against Philippine vessels.\nThe president's remarks came after the Chinese Foreign Ministry urged Manila to quickly withdraw the Typhoon missile system to \"correct the wrongdoing.\" The Philippine military hit back by vowing that \"no single entity\" can dictate how it conducts its defense deployments.\nReuters reported last week that the Typhon missile system was relocated from its original site at Laoag airfield on the island of Luzon in the northern Philippines to another location.\nA group of Philippine soldiers will be trained on the missile system next month with the U.S. Army's First Multi-Domain Task Force, which operates the weapon, it was announced on Tuesday, adding that the training would not include live-fire events.\nWhat People Are Saying\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Thursday: \"Well, I don't understand the comments on the Typhon missile system.

    "text": "\n Analysts say it the proposal was likely rhetorical rather than genuine, with little chance Beijing would ever take up such a deal   \nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr has publicly offered to remove the US-made Typhon missile system from his country if China ceases its \"aggressive and coercive behaviour\" in the South China Sea. \nSecurity experts view the proposal as a rhetorical challenge rather than a genuine attempt at negotiation, given the unlikelihood of Beijing curbing its claims over the disputed waterway. \nMarcos Jnr made his pledge on Thursday during the inauguration of an airport runway in Cebu, linking China's numerous objections to the Typhon's presence in the Philippines to Beijing's own missile arsenal. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \n\"I don't understand their comments on the Typhon missile system. We don't make any comments on their missile systems and their missile systems are a thousand created_ats more powerful than what we have,\" Marcos Jnr said. \nChina has yet to respond to the president's remarks, but it has repeatedly demanded the Typhon's removal since the land-based system, known formally as the Mid-Range Capability (MRC) missile launcher, was delivered to the Philippines in April by US forces for use in joint drills. \nThe launcher has remained in the country since then and the Philippines has announced plans to acquire a Typhon system of its own. \nThe land-based launcher can fire Raytheon's Standard Missile 6 (SM-6), which has a range of more than 240km, and the Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missile, with a range of roughly 2,500km. Its placement in the Philippines gives it coverage of the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. \nMarcos Jnr insisted Manila had justifications to keep the Typhon, yet offered to stand down if China would end what the Philippine government calls persistent harassment of its fishing boats and vessels. \n\"Let's make a deal with China - stop claiming our territory, stop harassing our fishermen and let them have a living, stop ramming our boats, stop water-cannoning our people, stop firing lasers at us, and stop your aggressive and coercive behaviour, and I'll return the Typhon missiles,\" he said. \nMarcos Jnr's ultimatum cast the Typhon as leverage, but analysts say it was more of a political statement than a serious offer - meant to highlight what they see as China's double standards. \nSherwin Ona, a visiting fellow at Taiwan's Institute for National Defence and Security Research, said the offer was a calculated move to call out the hypocrisy of Beijing's objections given its extensive military footprint. \n\"Remember that this pronouncement comes at a created_at when China's monster ships linger in our waters. This also coincides with the discovery of surveillance drones and the uncovering of espionage activities,\" said Ona, who is also an associate professor of political science at De La Salle University in Manila. \nSecurity analyst Matteo Piasentini, a lecturer at the University of the Philippines and analyst at the Indo-Pacific desk of Italian think tank Geopolitica, agreed that the offer was likely symbolic. \n\"He's using some rhetoric to reinforce the Philippines' stance. He knows that China won't accept such a deal overnight,\" Piasentini told This Week in Asia. \nHe said the Typhon was \"a deterrence tool that is needed to strengthen Philippines' capability and security,\" and called it unreasonable to scale back military modernisation \"without concrete security guarantees from China. Which historically have never really materialised\". \nBeijing claims nearly the entire South China Sea under its \"nine-dash line\" doctrine, dismissing overlapping claims from neighbours such as the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It also rejects a 2016 international arbitral ruling invalidating its sweeping claims, arguing the decision lacks legal merit. \nTensions in the disputed waterway have been high since late December, when China deployed a 165-metre coastguard vessel - dubbed \"the monster\" - some 77 nautical miles off the Philippine coast. \nMuhammad Faizal Bin Abdul Rahman, a research fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said it was politically implausible for China to accept Marcos Jnr's proposal, which implicitly calls on Beijing to renounce the \"nine-dash line\" central to its South China Sea stance. \n\"President Marcos Jnr's offer of a deal sounds like a sarcastic rebuttal of China's criticisms towards the Typhon missile system. Additionally, it implicitly reiterates that the Philippines will never capitulate to China over its interests in the South China Sea,\" Rahman told This Week in Asia. \nRahman said the regional impact of a Typhon withdrawal would depend on the circumstances, with potential consequences for both Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and broader security dynamics. \n\"If the pull out is due to China significantly reducing its assertive activities at South China Sea, it could mean a lesser security conundrum for other claimant states and Asean.\" \n\"But this is unlikely to happen as China would want to maintain pressure on the Philippines-US alliance and the region to pursue its strategic interests and the US would want to maintain military assets in the Philippines due to a possible Taiwan contingency and the US' strong anti-China stance,\" he explained. \nFormer Philippine Navy defence analyst Vincent Kyle Parada said the Philippines removing the Typhon could have mixed reactions within Asean, with some states possibly welcoming reduced tension, while others might see it as emboldening China. \n\"Should the Philippines agree to a withdrawal of the Typhon missile system, like-minded states is likely to see it as a coercive measure and move to denounce Beijing, while countries like Indonesia and Malaysia may welcome the development as a step back toward Asean centrality,\" he explained. \n\"In the end, however, the only opinion that matters is China's; and a pull-out will only embolden them to continue their coercive activities in order to extract future concessions,\" Parada added. \nIn a further sign of the system's importance to the Philippines, Colonel Louie Dema-ala said during a press briefing on Tuesday that the Army Artillery Regiment would train with the US Army Pacific on Typhon \"payload delivery\" this February. \n\"While the MRC is here, we will maximise its utilisation to train our personnel in this kind of new technology,\" he added. \nDefence expert Joshua Espeña, a lecturer at Polytechnic University of the Philippines, said removing the Typhon would give China more freedom to operate without interference. \n\"So, sticking the MRC right where it is supposed to be will complicate the People's Liberation Army moves at the operational level. But this scenario should not make Manila comfortable as Beijing is likely to play more cards at the table, say economic sticks and info warfare, to cripple decision making and weaken the kill chain of the MRC,\" Espeña said. \nIndeed, Parada said Marcos Jnr's administration would do well to exercise caution in entering any binding or temporary agreement with Beijing, warning that any concession would validate China's claims and set a precedent for future administrations to contend with. \nParada said he doubted Marcos Jnr would risk withdrawing the missiles ahead of the 2025 elections in May, arguing that such a move would damage domestic support. \"Doing so will only affirm an already brewing sencreated_atnt that the government is all bark and no bite,\" he said.  \n"

    "text": "\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's Southeast and East Asia strategies will be aimed at countering China by toughening U.S. policies to secure regional peace and maximize American interests, analysts say.\nRubio gave a glimpse of what U.S. foreign policy will look like as he began his first day as the head of the State Department last week.\nSpeaking to his staff after he was sworn on Jan. 21, Rubio said, Our job across the world is to ensure that we have a foreign policy that advances the national interest of the United States.\nReferencing President Donald Trump's objective, Rubio continued that the overriding goal of global policy is the promotion of peace, the avoidance of conflict.\nPutting America First and achieving Peace through Strength are twin pillars on which Trump said he will prop up the U.S. as he took office on Jan. 20.\nRubio is currently likely to consult with country directors of the region and coordinate with the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to formulate Asia Pacific strategies, said Richard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state during the Bush administration, to VOA Korean on Jan. 24.\nSecretary Rubio's Southeast Asia policy will focus on countering China through stronger U.S. trade, security partnerships and supply chain diversification, said Mark Kennedy, director at the Wilson Center's Wahba Institute for Strategic Competition, to VOA on Jan. 23\nOn Pyongyang and Moscow, Rubio will ask China - as Trump did - to help convince North Korea to resume negotiations with the U.S., said Joseph DeTrani, who served as special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks with North Korea during the George W. Bush administration.\nIf successful, with or without China's help, this may help to distance North Korea from Russia, DeTrani told VOA on Jan. 24.\nRubio's roots\nIn shaping and executing regional policies, Rubio's strong opposition to authoritarianism, communism, and human rights violations is likely to color his approach at the State Department, said Evans Revere, who served as acting secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs during the George W. Bush administration.\nThe former senator grew up in Miami with Cuban immigrant parents and has exhibited an aversion toward communist governments throughout his political career.\nThis stance, mixed with the twin foreign policy pillars, are likely to result in tough strategies for countries like North Korea and China and their activities in the region, according to analysts.\nRubio signaled this on a call with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday, stressing that the Trump Administration will pursue a U.S.-PRC relationship that advances U.S. interests and the United States' commitment to our allies in the region. China's official name is the People's Republic of China (PRC).\nHe also expressed serious concern over China's coercive actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea.\nIn line with the policy goal of avoiding conflict, Rubio may support Trump's personal diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration.\nNorth Korea said Sunday it conducted a sea-to-surface strategic cruise missile test the previous day.\nRubio, doubtful initially about Trump's summits with Kim during his first term, said at a confirmation hearing earlier this month that Trump's personal diplomacy was able to stop the country from testing missiles.\nHe spoke by phone with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul last week emphasizing the alliance is the linchpin of peace on the Korean Peninsula and across the Indo-Pacific.\nIn a meeting also last week in Washington, Rubio and Japanese Foreign Minister Iwaya Takeshi discussed North Korea's ties with Russia.\nRally against China\nAmong Southeast Asian countries, Rubio last week held calls with the foreign ministers of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, each created_at stressing stable maricreated_at security in the South China Sea.\nParticularly in his calls with Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo, Rubio underscored PRC's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea.\nWith Vietnamese Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son, Rubio expressed concern over China's aggressive behavior in the South China Sea.\nGregory Poling, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told VOA on January 23 that the Trump administration will look primarily to the Philippines and outside partners like Japan and Australia to defend freedom of the seas in the South China Sea.\nOne of the first meetings Rubio held was with the Australian, Japanese and Indian leaders of the Quad security dialogue last week in Washington where they expressed opposition to unilateral actions to change the status quo of the region by force or coercion and vowed to keep the Indo-Pacific free and open.\nPoling continued the administration will look secondarily to Vietnam, Singapore, and Indonesia to deepen practical maricreated_at cooperation.\nRubio may push Indonesia to take a stronger stance vis-\\xE0-vis Chinese activities in disputed waters, particularly in light of controversial Indonesia-China maricreated_at development deal signed in November 2024, Anreyka Natalegawa, associate fellow for the Southeast Asia Program at CSIS told VOA on Jan. 23.\nIndonesia and China signed a $10 billion deal in November agreeing to develop fisheries, oil and gas exploration, among other things, across their private sectors.\nDiplomatic balancing\nAnalysts say Washington's push to have regional countries align more closely with Washington could lead to some tensions. Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar tend to lean more toward Beijing, and Indonesia tends to balance its engagement with China and the U.S.\nRobert McMahon, a foreign relations expert at The Ohio State University, said Rubio's harsh stance on China could put Indonesia in a difficult position, since it has not been willing to join the anti-China bandwagon.\nHe told VOA in December after Rubio was nominated as the secretary of state that to the extent that the United States tries to pressure Indonesia to move in that direction, that could lead to some conflict.\nRubio said to his State Department staff last week that he expects other countries to advance their national interests but hopes there will be many - in which our national interests and theirs align.\nSeng Vanly, an assistant dean and lecturer at the Techo Sen School of Government and International Relations at the University of Cambodia, said Washington is likely to increase pressure on Cambodia over concerns for human rights, democratic setbacks, and restricted civil society activities, coupled with its growing ties with China.\nHowever, analysts say U.S. foreign policy under Rubio will likely balance issues such as human rights with regional security and economic goals.\nRahman Yaacob, a research fellow for the Southeast Asia program at the Lowy Institute, said, Washington will be more practical.\nWhile it could raise human rights issues with regional countries, the Americans understand if they disengage from the region because of human rights, China will fill in the void, Yaacob said.\nHan Noy from Khmer Service, Yuni Salim from Indonesian Service contributed to this report. - VOA\n"

It also announced the purchase of two French Scorpene Evolved submarines and 13 Thales Ground Control Interception radars. Five of the radar systems are expected to be installed in the country’s new capital, Nusantara.\nThe purchases come as tensions are rising in the region, particularly in the disputed South China Sea, where China is asserting its expansive territorial claims. While Indonesia is not a claimant state, it has clashed with China over fishing rights near the Natuna Islands, which lie within its exclusive economic zone but are also claimed by China.\nThe South China Sea contains crucial shipping lanes, abundant fish stocks and undersea mineral resources. Efforts between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to establish a code of conduct to prevent conflicts have seen little progress.\n"

    "text": "\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos jr said yesterday he would meet US President Donald Trump to discuss issues including immigration, in an effort to influence policy.\nHe said this could impact a large number of Filipinos in the US. \n“We will see how we can influence policymaking in terms of immigration,” Marcos said without saying when the meeting would take place. \nSince taking office on January 20, Trump has announced a number of immigration-related executive orders that focus on stricter border policy, tighter visa-vetting procedures, and a crackdown on undocumented migrants in the US. \nThere are more than 300 000 undocumented Filipinos in the US, according to a 2019 estimate by the think tank Migration Policy Institute. Close to two million migrants from the Philippines live in the US, according to a 2024 report by the US Census Bureau. \nMarcos also said he would return a Typhon missile system to the US if China ceased what he said was aggressive and coercive behaviour, and its claiming of territory in the South China Sea. \nTensions between China and the Philippines have escalated in recent years, and the Philippines has moved closer to Washington, which is also keen to counter China’s increasingly assertive claims in the disputed waterway. \nChina has strongly opposed the US deployment of the Typhon for exercises in the Philippines, and has repeatedly called for its withdrawal. \n“I don’t understand the comments on the Typhon missile system. We don’t make any comments on their missile systems, and their missile systems are a thousand created_ats more powerful than what we have,” Marcos said.\n“Let’s make a deal with China: stop claiming our territory, stop harassing our fishermen and let them have a living, stop ramming our boats, stop water cannoning our people, stop firing lasers at us, and stop your aggressive and coercive behaviour, and I’ll return the Typhon missiles,” he said. \nBeijing, which claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, has repeatedly accused Philippine vessels of encroachment into its territory. \nBilateral ties are at their worst in years after repeated confrontations and heated diplomatic rows. The Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the president’s remarks. \nThe Typhon missile system was deployed by US forces to the Philippines in April last year as part of their Balikatan or “shoulder-to-shoulder” military exercises, and has since remained in the country. \nReuters reported last week the launchers had been redeployed to a new location in the Philippines, which officials declined to disclose. \nIn 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled China’s claims had no legal basis, siding with the Philippines.  |  Reuters\n"

    "text": "\nPhilippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. on Thursday said he plans to meet with US President Donald J. Trump to discuss various issues including immigration, in an effort to influence policy that he said could affect a large number of Filipinos in the US.\n“We will see how we can influence policymaking in terms of immigration,” Marcos said without saying when that meeting would take place.\nMr. Trump has clamped down on immigration, vowing to undo the policies of his predecessor that he said enabled the large influx of undocumented immigrants.\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has said it is impossible for about 300,000 undocumented Filipinos in the US to be deported in the next four years.\n“About a few hundred Filipinos have been sent home,” Mr. Marcos said in Filipino. “This is something that we have to work through and hopefully resolve because the Filipinos in the United States, especially, have really [become an] important part already of their workforce.”\nSpeaking with reporters on various topics, Mr. Marcos also said he would return a Typhon missile system to the US if China ceased what he said was aggressive and coercive behavior, including claiming features in the South China Sea.\nChina has opposed the US deployment of the missile system for exercises in the Philippines, a defense ally of Washington, and has repeatedly called for its withdrawal.\n“I don’t understand the comments on the Typhon missile system,” Mr. Marcos said. “We don’t make any comments on their missile systems and their missile systems are a thousand created_ats more powerful than what we have.”\n“Let’s make a deal with China: Stop claiming our territory, stop harassing our fishermen and let them have a living, stop ramming our boats, stop water cannoning our people, stop firing lasers at us and stop your aggressive and coercive behavior and I’ll return the Typhon missiles,” he added.\nChina, which claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, has repeatedly accused Philippine vessels of encroachment on its territory.

Teresa Magbanua replaced the 44- meter vessel BRP Cabra, which arrived at Subic Port on Tuesday morning to unload the text of a fisherman that it recovered on Monday.\nTeresa Magbanua can displace 2,265 tons of water, compared with 12,000 tons for China Coast Guard ship 5901, the largest coast guard cutter in the world.\nThe PCG on Monday night accused China Coast Guard (CCG) 3304 of shadowing its ship that was rescuing a distressed fishing boat near the Zambales coast.\nIt said Cabra navigated through heavy waves to retrieve the text of a Filipino fisherman using its crane.\n“It is crucial to note that the Chinese Coast Guard vessel CCG 3304, despite being aware of the distress call from the Filipino fishermen, engaged in shadowing that hindered the PCG vessel’s efforts to recover the text,” the PCG earlier said.\nThe Philippines has accused China of intimidating Filipino fishermen near Scarborough Shoal and normalizing its “illegal presence” after Beijing sent its monster ship into the Philippine EEZ on Jan. 4.\nA United Nations-backed court in The Hague voided China’s expansive claim in the South China Sea in 2016, as it ruled the shoal is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen.\n"

    "text": "\nMANILA — By Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega’s reckoning, the Philippines will not be severely impacted by President Donald Trump’s suspension of all United States’ foreign development assistance to countries around the world, since we have many other economic partners to count on.\nWhile acknowledging that trade with the US remains high, De Vega noted that the aid freeze is not likely “to severely affect us because aid packages from the US are small right now.”\nHis optimistic view might be premature though as Philippine officials, and the world for that matter, have yet to see the detailed list of US-funded development programs that could potentially be scuttled following the Trump administration’s 90-day review.\nWithin hours of his inauguration, Trump fired off orders that shook many countries and global institutions. This included US withdrawal from the Paris Climate pact and the World Health Organization, as well as the deportation of illegal migrants to the US.‘America First’\nOn Monday, he ordered a freeze on all US development and military assistance to partner countries, pending a review on whether they align with his “America First” policy. The only exemption from the freeze order is military aid for Israel and Egypt. The Philippines was among 17 countries identified for foreign military assistance in 2025, but it’s not yet clear if this is covered by the freeze as well.\nDe Vega, however, remains certain that the new sites for the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (Edca) won’t be affected, an optimism that may have basis in fact. With the Philippines providing a strategic location for safeguarding US interests in the Indo-Pacific amid China’s increasing aggression in the South China Sea, the Trump administration would be foolish and short-sighted to withhold funding from its long-created_at ally this side of the world.\nThe newly appointed US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, has also reiterated the US’ “ironclad” commitment to defending the Philippines amid China’s provocative actions in the West Philippine Sea under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. “An armed attack in the Pacific, including anywhere in the South China Sea, on either of their public vessels, aircraft, or armed forces—which includes their Coast Guards — would invoke mutual defense commitments,” the US Department of State said after Rubio met with Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo earlier this month.Proactive and pragmatic\nRubio was further quoted by the state department as denouncing China’s “dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea,” saying that they violated international law.\nWith Rubio’s personal assurances of continuing US engagement on military and defense matters, it’s the non-military assistance that Philippine officials must seriously worry about. It’s imperative that they take a proactive and pragmatic approach with the US aid freeze order affecting programs on economic development, health, education, job training, anticorruption, peace efforts, and even disaster response.\nThe US Agency for International Development (USAID) disbursed $198.2 million to the Philippines in 2023 for various programs. With $5 million set aside by the USAID for Improving Learning Outcomes for the Philippines program launched in 2023, Education Secretary Sonny Angara has expressed hope that US funding for education would “survive” the freeze.\nAccording to the US state department website, the USAID has invested more than $5 billion in the Philippines since 1961, with priorities such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, promoting renewable energy, peace efforts in Mindanao, bolstering economic recovery, advancing democratic values, fighting corruption, and advocating for human rights.Regional peace\nThis sizeable amount invariably affects the country’s economy and cannot be shrugged off. Rather than being nonchalant about the potential reduction or removal of US funding on certain programs, the Philippines must preemptively assess and prepare for such eventuality.\nPhilippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez and the Department of Foreign Affairs should work the diplomatic channels in Washington to save the Philippines from possible withdrawal of US funding for these critical programs.\nThis should be a test of just how loyal and committed the US is to the Philippines beyond its strategic importance in regional peace and security. That is certainly a card that the Philippines should not shy away from using in these troubled created_ats.\nIn the long run, any potential setback in US aid should be offset by initiatives to deepen the country’s relations with its other trusted allies, especially Japan which is the largest source of official development assistance to the Philippines. With the Reciprocal Access Agreement signed recently to widen the two countries’ defense alliance, Japan’s close ties with the Philippines will prove to be crucial as we grapple with four years under Trump’s inward-looking presidency.\n©2025 Asia News Network.

    "created_at": "2025-01-31",
    "text": "\nA potential US$450 million missile deal between India and Indonesia highlights Jakarta's bid to enhance its naval power, as both nations seek to strengthen and diversify defence ties in response to China's growing territorial ambitions in the region, analysts say. \nDuring a recent state visit to India, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to expand cooperation in defence manufacturing and maricreated_at safety, culminating with Subianto attending India's Republic Day celebrations as the chief guest. \nModi said that strengthening ties with Indonesia would be crucial in \"maintaining peace, security, prosperity and rules-based order in this entire region\".  \nWhile neither leader specifically mentioned China, Modi stressed that India and Indonesia were committed to promoting \"freedom of navigation\" under international law - the principle that ships can move freely through international waters without interference. The phrase is often invoked in response to Beijing's expansive maricreated_at claims and growing assertiveness in the South China Sea and other key waterways. \nLeading up to the meeting, speculation grew that Jakarta would finalise its purchase of BrahMos cruise missiles, co- produced by India and Russia. If completed, Indonesia would become the second country, after the Philippines, to procure the shore-based version of the mid-range missiles, as well as a variant for warships.  \nAlthough the missile deal was not finalised during Prabowo's visit, Indian media reports citing government sources said talks were now in \"advanced stages\" after years of prolonged negotiations. \nAhmad Rizky Umar, an international relations and Indonesian politics expert at Aberystwyth University in Britain, said that for the Philippines, it was logical to shore up its maricreated_at defences with cruise missiles as the South China Sea increasingly becomes a flashpoint.  \n\"I think Prabowo has a similar interest because Indonesia, like the Philippines, shares maricreated_at territories [with other nations], so it will also be very vulnerable to any threats, not only in the South China Sea but also in the Indian Ocean,\" he said. \n\"Indonesia wants to anticipate any conflict in the future that can undermine its maricreated_at territorial integrity.\" \nHe noted that this followed Jakarta's efforts to bolster maricreated_at defences with Japan earlier this month. Both sides seem on the cusp of a landmark agreement to co-develop a warship for the Indonesian navy. Japan has also pledged to give Indonesia two high-speed patrol boats.  \nNatalie Sambhi, executive director of independent think tank Verve Research and lecturer at Deakin University, Australian War College, said closer security ties would mitigate Indonesia's and India's dependence on either the US or China, allowing both countries to \"remain strategically nonaligned.\" \nPrabowo, who assumed the presidency in October and was previously Indonesia's defence minister, is expected to prioritise military modernisation, analysts said, diversifying regional partnerships in line with Indonesia's non-aligned foreign policy approach. \nAnastasia Febiola, a research coordinator and manager of consultancy firm Semar Sentinel Indonesia, said Indonesia had historically sourced its missiles from Europe and the US. During his tenure as defence minister, Prabowo avoided military deals with Russia or China, and sourced weapons mainly from Italy, Sweden, Belgium, the United States and South Korea. \nTherefore, if the BrahMos deal with India were finalised, it would signify \"a pretty important act\" for Indonesia, Anastasia said.  \n\"It also balances Indonesia's position towards Western countries. \n\"With the uncertain geopolitical dynamics and tensions in the Indo-Pacific region, strengthening its armed forces deterrence capability has become more urgent for Indonesia,\" Anastasia said. \nEstablishing stronger relations with Southeast Asia has also been a focus for India under its Act Easy Policy, as Delhi looks to position itself as a regional power serving as a counterbalance to China. \nAccording to Umar, India perceives defence deals as a viable strategy to achieve its objectives, particularly as it may struggle to compete with China regarding trade. \nSambhi from Verve Research said that Indonesia stood to become \"a model customer\" for New Delhi's defence industry exports, which could also pave the way for India to enter other markets in Southeast Asia. \nIndian news outlets, meanwhile, reported that during Prabowo's state visit, Indonesian officials expressed interest not only in BrahMos missiles, but also in India's aircraft carrier-building capacities.  \nAccording to Sambhi, operating an aircraft carrier could be viewed as a \"wealth and power flex\", especially for a developing country. \n\"Indonesia's interest in pursuing such a capability is completely on brand with Prabowo's aspirations that his country take its place among the bigger regional and global powers,\" she said.  \nHowever, Umar added that Prabowo would have to balance such ambitions with several populist programmes he had introduced, including a newly implemented scheme providing free meals to 83 million children and pregnant mothers. This plan alone is expected to cost nearly US$30 billion annually when fully in operation. \nNegotiations over the BrahMos missiles have reportedly stalled since 2009, primarily due to budget constraints, which Anastasia identified as the main challenge for Indonesia's defence modernisation plan, as funds would also be needed for personnel welfare programmes and equipment maintenance.\n"

    "text": "\nChina's use of a long-range acoustic device against Filipino sailors in the South China Sea marks an increase in aggression in the disputed waters, a Philippine Navy spokesman said.\nThe BRP Cabra, a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) ship, faced off with Chinese coast guard vessel 3203 and two other Chinese ships as it tried to sail on Saturday within Manila's exclusive economic zone off the coast of Zambales, a province in the northern Philippines.\nDuring the encounter, Filipino crew members described hearing a piercing sound at high decibels that could damage ears and cause severe discomfort.\nThe long-range acoustic device [LRAD] is an increase in the aggression of the Chinese Communist Party in the West Philippine Sea, said Rear Adm. Roy Vincent Trinidad, navy spokesman for the West Philippine Sea - Manila's name for South China Sea waters within its exclusive economic zone.\n[Saturday's incident] only highlights the illegal presence, their coercive and now more aggressive actions, Trinidad told reporters on Tuesday.\nAnalysts said that the auditory weapon was the latest in China's gray-zone tactics - activities that fall between ordinary statecraft and open warfare - to advance its interests without necessarily provoking war.\nIt follows the same tactic Beijing used in 2023, when the China Coast Guard (CCG) pointed a laser at a PCG vessel, temporarily blinding some crewmembers.\nThe LRAD is a sound weapon that is harmful and can lead to deafness if overexposed. China has used this gray-zone tactic before against the PCG and it's not something new as a military operation, said security analyst Chester Cabalza, head of the International Development and Security Cooperation, a Philippine think-tank.\nBut due to its detrimental effects to health and human text, this is no different to the lights war or laser light that Beijing keeps on poking against Manila in the [West Philippine Sea], he told RFA affiliate BenarNews.\nHe said China had been abusing the gray-zone tactic, which he described as illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive in nature.\nLast week, Filipino scientists were forced to suspend a mission to a cay near Philippine-occupied Thitu (Pag-asa) island when three CCG vessels subjected it to aggressive maneuvers, Philippine officials said.\nTrinidad noted that the actions at sea came shortly after a suspected Chinese spy was caught with two Filipino accomplices after allegedly scouting sensitive areas around Luzon - the main northern Philippine island - including near military bases that host American troops.\nTrinidad said the arrested Chinese national and suspected accomplices were conducting intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance of government critical infrastructure.\nConnecting all these dots, we could now see a bigger picture that would give the government a clearer picture of what is happening. It's not yet a complete puzzle. The puzzle is still being assembled, but we are now starting to see bits and pieces of the direction where this is taking us, the navy spokesman said.\nAlthough Trinidad would not elaborate on the alleged spy's mission, the Philippines has allowed American troops access to nine bases throughout the country. Three of those are located in northern Luzon and face Taiwan, which China has threatened to invade.\nTyphon training\nAlso on Tuesday, Army spokesman Col. Louie Dema-ala confirmed that Filipino soldiers would train with U.S. troops next month in using the Typhon mid-range missile system. It has been in the country since last year, but Beijing has hotly protested the weapons deployment.\nThe Philippine Army has indicated its plans to acquire the system.\nIn the meancreated_at, Dema-ala said Filipino soldiers would train with their American counterparts in the Typhon's payload delivery system.\nThis is planned. It will be conducted somecreated_at in the second week to the third week of February, he told a news briefing.\nThe Typhon System can fire the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) and Tomahawk missiles and support strike capabilities from land, sea and air.\nThe missile system, developed by U.S. firm Lockheed Martin, has a range of 480 kilometers (300 miles), and can reach the disputed Scarborough Shoal as well as targets around Taiwan.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "text": "\nBeijing [China], January 31 (ANI): China has made no secret of its desire to annex Taiwan, which it may do by cutting off supplies and imposing a blockade on the self-governing island. To thwart the US military from assisting Taiwan, the Chinese military recently conducted drills, according to a report by The Eurasian created_ats.\nAccording to an analysis by the Japan Institute for National Fundamentals, as quoted by The Eurasian created_ats, the goal of the December 2024 Chinese simulation was to train to prevent US forces from accessing the sea surrounding the island.\nTo prevent American warships from entering the area, China stationed 18 destroyers and frigates east of the \"first island chain,\" which stretches from the Philippines to Japan's Nansei Islands, during the war drills. The exercise took place from December 6-12, as reported by The Eurasian created_ats.\nIt is reported that China used anti-access/area denial (A2AD) tactics to keep US forces from passing the first island chain, which is situated west of the second chain, and to the west of the \"second island chain,\" which stretches from Guam to the Izu Islands in Japan. \nFor China, it was the biggest military drill in almost thirty years. China not only showed that it could blockade Taiwan, but it also asserted its dominance over the First Island Chain, which includes the South and East China Seas and extends from Japan to Indonesia.\nOne significant event was the first coordination of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern, Southern, and Northern Theatre Commands, which allowed them to put pressure on Taiwan and its allies by conducting large-scale combined arms drills throughout a wide area as per The Eurasian created_ats. \nChina also deployed more than 60 PLA-Navy warships and 30 China Coast Guard vessels in areas ranging from the South China Sea to Japan's Ryukyu Islands, in addition to the more than 134 PLA airplanes that flew during the three-day exercises near the islands as reported.\nWithout receiving live-fire training, the Chinese forces practised attacking foreign ships, obstructing maricreated_at routes, and intercepting commercial vessels. In order to restrict access to the First Island Chain, the PLA-Navy also constructed two barriers southeast of Taiwan, as reported by The Eurasian created_ats.

    "created_at": "2025-01-31",
    "text": "\nMANILA  The Philippine authorities are pushing for tougher anti-espionage laws after the recent arrest of a suspected Chinese spy raised concerns over foreign intelligence threats to national security. \n The government suspects China has \"extensive operations\" to infiltrate the Philippines' security infrastructure as tensions mount over the South China Sea, National Security Council spokesman Jonathan Malaya said during a public forum on the sea dispute held in Manila on Jan 29. \n He said the arrest of alleged Chinese spy Deng Yuanqing and two of his Filipino cohorts on Jan 17 was just the \"tip of the iceberg\" of Beijing's alleged espionage activities. He added that it highlights the need to give more teeth to the Philippines' outdated espionage laws. \n Mr Malaya asked lawmakers to pass the pending Bill amending the World War II-era Espionage Act and another Bill aimed to counter foreign interference and malign operations in the country. \n \"These amendments are clearly very needed, given the fact we are slowly uncovering a lot of intelligence operations being done by foreign powers in the Philippines,\" he said, adding that by amending the anti-espionage laws, \"we will be able to complete our defence system against them (spies) because we really need good legal foundations to be able to proceed forward\". \n The Philippines' Espionage Act, enacted in June 1941, punishes spying and other offences against national security. But the anti-espionage provision applies only during created_ats of war. \n The law also punishes those convicted of spying with imprisonment of up to 10 years and a fine of up to 10,000 pesos (S$230), which Mr Malaya said would not be enough to deter espionage activities. \n The pending Bills in Congress propose applying the anti-espionage provision even during created_ats of peace. They also seek to impose heftier fines of up to one million pesos and life imprisonment for those charged under the espionage law. \n Former Supreme Court associate justice Antonio Carpio also said during the forum that the Philippines needs to update and amend the Revised Penal Code, as it punishes Filipinos for committing treason only during created_ats of war. \n \"So if a Filipino helps the Chinese gather information vital for our national security, he cannot be prosecuted for treason,\" Mr Carpio said. \n Deng and his Filipino accomplices were accused of using sophisticated equipment to map out infrastructure in strategic areas in the Philippines, including military bases that the US has access to under a defence deal with Manila.\n When asked for comment by reporters on Deng's arrest, the Chinese Embassy in Manila said the accusations were \"baseless\". The embassy told the Philippine government to \"stop airing groundless speculations about the so-called 'Chinese spy case'\" and to protect the rights of Chinese citizens in the country.\n \"We urge the Philippine side to base its judgment on facts (and) not to make (a) presumption of guilt,\" the embassy said in a statement on Jan 25. \n Deng's case is just the latest involving China's alleged espionage activities that the Philippine government has publicised in the past months.\n The authorities said at least five underwater drones were recovered in various parts of the country in 2024, with officials believing these were Chinese-made and likely used for navigation and reconnaissance.\n In late January, officials arrested two Chinese nationals caught taking cellphone videos of Philippine Coast Guard ships passing by a resort in Palawan. \n The suspects denied allegations of wrongdoing, but the authorities found photos of Filipino military camps and other equipment on their devices. \n The biggest espionage-related case to rock the nation is that of Alice Guo, the former mayor of a small Philippine town who was accused of being a Chinese spy and crime boss linked to the country's now-banned online casino industry consisting of Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos).\n Guo is now in jail after money laundering, human trafficking and graft charges were lodged against her. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr banned Pogos in July 2024 after the industry was linked to crime syndicates. \n Officials also found alleged Chinese military uniforms and suspected espionage equipment during Pogo hub raids conducted in 2024, Colonel Francel Padilla, the Armed Forces of the Philippines' (AFP) spokeswoman, said in the Jan 29 forum.  \n She said the AFP is now investigating to \"connect the dots\" regarding all these activities linked to Beijing.\n \"We're checking how all of these connect to the geopolitical tensions that we're facing (with Beijing),\" Col Padilla said. \"We're looking at all of these things and trying to see how all of these incidents fit into a grand plan.\" \n Col Padilla said the Philippine government is not targeting a specific country in the ongoing investigation but added that the evidence gathered regarding the suspected espionage activities so far can all be linked back to China. \n \"They will have the opportunity to defend their case in court,\" she said. \n Geopolitical analyst Don McLain Gill of De La Salle University in Manila told The Straits created_ats that it is about created_at the Philippines focused more on combating China's alleged espionage activities, claiming that the latter aims to sow social discord and political destabilisation.\n He said the Marcos government is now challenged to clamp down on these operations while continuing efforts to protect the country's claims in the South China Sea.\n \"This would require a lot of political resource in order to make sure that the clear message is sent that the Philippines is not going to tolerate these destabilising efforts from within,\" he said. \n\nGraphic\n \nDeng Yuanqing (centre) with an alleged Filipino accomplice (second from left) being escorted in Manila on Jan 20.

    "created_at": "2025-01-31",
    "text": "\n At a public lecture in Phnom Penh, Cambodia was urged to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to better safeguard its maricreated_at boundaries and resources, including fisheries, oil and gas. Although Cambodia has been a signatory to UNCLOS since 1983, it has yet to ratify the convention.\nThe recommendation was raised during a public lecture on 'The Roles of International Law in Promoting Peaceful Dispute Settlement in the Indo-Pacific,' held at Sunway Hotel Phnom Penh on Wednesday. The event gathered around 50 participants, including government officials, diplomats, think tank representatives, and researchers.\nIn an interview with Khmer created_ats following the lecture, Pou Sothirak, Senior Advisor to the Cambodian Centre for Regional Studies (CCRS), emphasised the legal benefits of UNCLOS ratification.\n'What kind of safeguard mechanism (exists)? If you are a member of UNCLOS, you can count on UNCLOS to protect your own national interest,' he said. 'I think Cambodia now, we signed on to UNCLOS, but we have not yet ratified UNCLOS to my knowledge.'\nCambodia is already a party to the four 1958 Geneva Conventions on the Law of the Sea and the 1970 Optional Protocol concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes. However, its legislative bodies have yet to ratify the 1982 UNCLOS, which came into force in 1994 for states that have ratified or acceded to it.\n'This is an issue. If we ratify UNCLOS, we can also protect what is in the sea that belongs to Cambodia,' Sothirak said. 'We have a very long coastline, and according to international law, the 200 nautical miles extend from the land and include maricreated_at resources - Cambodia can have rightful ownership to these maricreated_at bounties, including fisheries and what's underneath, which could be oil and gas.'\nCambodia's coastline stretches 435 kilometres along the Gulf of Thailand, covering the provinces of Koh Kong, Kampot, Kep, and Preah Sihanouk, with maricreated_at borders shared with Thailand and Vietnam.\nUNCLOS is the primary international treaty governing maricreated_at rights and responsibilities. It defines maricreated_at zones - including territorial waters and exclusive economic zones - and sets rules for navigation, environmental protection, scientific research, and the exploitation of marine resources.\nSothirak noted that smaller states like Cambodia must support and adhere to international law, as it offers protection in sovereignty claims, border disputes, and maricreated_at rights.\n'International law will safeguard - at least help Cambodia amplify - its claims. If you are a member of a convention, any international law convention or treaty, Cambodia can rely on such law to protect its national interests. We also need to strengthen our participation in international discussions, particularly at the United Nations,' he said.\nProfessor Shotaro Hamamoto of Kyoto University agreed with this sencreated_atnt, stressing the advantages of UNCLOS membership.\n'If you participate as a member, as a state party to UNCLOS, then you can make use of a wide variety of opportunities, such as a conference of parties, which examines the implementation of the convention, and if you really wish to settle a dispute through legal, judicial means,' he said.\nBeyond national interests, Sothirak also highlighted the need for ASEAN to strengthen its dispute settlement mechanisms, particularly when dealing with extra-regional powers such as those involved in the South China Sea issue. He asserted that ASEAN must reinforce its centrality to remain effective in regional diplomacy.\n'ASEAN centrality is about leadership, it's about unity, it's about one voice behind very clear decisions on the rules-based order. You have to be very clear on the issues, because otherwise, ASEAN's relevance - ASEAN centrality - is in doubt. And once it's in doubt, all ASEAN frameworks will also be weakened,' he said, further emphasising that ASEAN must assert its own strategic autonomy.\n"

    "text": "\nFearing that United States President Donald Trump might bypass Japan and negotiate security matters directly with China, analysts said Tokyo was scrambling to keep Washington firmly anchored in the Asia-Pacific. \nLast Friday, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba vowed to maintain regional stability and prepare for tough talks with Trump to secure a continued American commitment, describing US involvement as essential \"to prevent any power vacuum from destabilising it\". \nIshiba's government, which has been trying to meet Trump since his November electoral victory, announced it was arranging a trip to Washington in the coming weeks. \nTomoo Kikuchi, a professor at the Graduate School of Asia-Pacific Studies at Waseda University, said Japan's concern stemmed from its perception that a growing gap in military capability between Beijing and Tokyo, even with US support, would embolden China to challenge the status quo. \n\"The erratic behaviour of the Trump administration increases Japan's uncertainty and need for reassurance,\" Kikuchi said, adding that \"Tokyo dreads that Trump might even negotiate with Xi directly over regional security issues\". \nDays before taking office, Trump and President Xi Jinping discussed various issues on the phone, including trade and fentanyl. In December, Trump also invited Xi to attend his presidential inauguration, an unprecedented act for a US president. While Xi did not accept the invitation, Vice-President Han Zheng represented China at the event. \nKikuchi said he did not expect Trump to show much enthusiasm for regional partnerships such as three-way cooperation with South Korea and the Philippines or the Quad with Australia and India, despite being \"helpful as additional hedges for Japan\". \n\"Chances are not so high either that Ishiba can convince Trump that deepening Japan-US ties is essential for US interests,\" he said. \"So, no change and continued US presence will be the best outcome,\" Kikuchi said, adding the US-China rivalry might make it more likely for Beijing to seek more stable ties with Tokyo. \nEarlier this month, the governing parties of China and Japan held their first dialogue in over six years, pledging to enhance exchanges and promote strategic and mutually beneficial ties. \nJapan's security concerns have intensified because of Beijing's expanded presence and increased assertiveness in the South China Sea, especially near the Phil- ippines, and by large-scale military drills in the Taiwan Strait. Additionally, Chinese coastguard vessels have entered waters Tokyo considers its territory. \nKei Koga, an associate professor in the public policy and global affairs programme at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, said Japan's primary objective was to secure the ­\"minimum necessary commitments\" from the US. \n\"[These include] reassurance regarding the US-Japan alliance, the defence of Japan, and a sustained US presence in the Indo-Pacific,\" Koga said, noting these commitments were made under the first Trump administration and Tokyo was seeking to ensure their continuity. \n\"Ishiba's initial aim is, at least, to secure verbal commitments from Trump,\" Koga said, particularly on maintaining Washington's diplomatic and military influence and visibility. \nGiven Trump's transactional approach, Koga said Washington might reduce its diplomatic engagement with regional multilateral frameworks such as Asean. \nThe US was also likely to adopt a tougher position on allies, emphasising burden-sharing, demanding significant increases in defence budgets and arms procurement from the US, and even threatening to reduce American troop deployments in the region, Koga said. \n\"Such a diplomatic posture could lead to miscalculations with both US allies and rivals. To avoid this, Ishiba aims to ensure the continuity of the US' presence, which is essential for regional stability,\" Koga said. \nPurnendra Jain, an emeritus professor at the University of Adelaide's Department of Asian Studies who specialises in Japan studies, said that given Ishiba's low popularity, Japanese voters had minimal expectations. \n\"If Ishiba can negotiate with Trump successfully, his popularity will rise,\" Jain said, adding that given Trump's policy of putting \"America first\", Tokyo must consider increasing investments and purchases from the US.\n"

    "title": "MISSILE PULLOUT FOR END TO HARASSMENT Marcos to China: 'Let's make a deal'",
    "created_at": "2025-01-31",
    "text": "\nPRESIDENT Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday told China that he would return the Typhon missile system to the United States only if it stopped harassing Filipino vessels and claiming territory in the West Philippine Sea.\nMarcos issued the statement after China urged the Philippine government to pull out the missile launchers after they were reportedly moved to another area in Luzon.\nIn a media interview in Lapu-Lapu City, Marcos said he did not understand why China opposed the Philippines' use of the Typhon missile system when it has even more powerful weapons.\n\"Well, I don't understand the comments on the Typhon missile system. We don't make any comments on their missile systems, and their missile systems are a thousand created_ats more powerful than what we have. So I don't understand,\" Marcos told reporters.\nThe president said he would only send back the US Typhon missile system if China stopped harassing Filipinos in the West Philippine Sea.\n\"You know, let's make a deal with China - stop claiming our territory, stop harassing our fishermen and let them have a living, stop ramming our boats, stop water-cannoning our people, stop firing lasers at us, and stop your aggressive and coercive behavior, and I'll return the Typhon missiles,\" he said.\n\"Stop all their aggressive acts, and I'll take back everything,\" the president added.\nThe Typhon mid-range capability surface-to-surface missile launchers arrived in the country in April 2024 and were last known to be stationed somewhere in Ilocos Norte, a coastal province facing Taiwan. \nReports said the US military has redeployed the launchers to an undisclosed location on Luzon.\nPhilippine military officials said they would train on the missile system in February, and expressed the country's intent to obtain Typhon launchers to bolster its defense capabilities. \nThe land-based Typhon missile launcher, developed by US firm Lockheed Martin, reportedly has a range of 480 kilometers, though a longer-range version is in development. \nIt can fire multi-purpose missiles up to thousands of kilometers such as Tomahawk cruise missiles, capable of hitting targets in both China and Russia from the Philippines. The SM-6 missiles it carries can strike air or sea targets more than 200 km away.\nChina has opposed the presence of the missile system in the country, but the Department of National Defense has refused Chinese demands to remove it.\nArmed Forces chief Romeo Brawner Jr. defended the presence of the Typhon missiles and said he hoped the country would acquire them soon.\nLast week, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning urged the Philippine government to pull out the missile launcher, saying the country must stop \"going further down the wrong path.\"\nShe reiterated China's stand that the Philippines was \"creating tensions and antagonism\" in the region in the US deployment of the mid-range capability missile system in the Philippines.\n\"Let me stress again that by bringing this strategic offensive weapon into this part of the world, the Philippines is essentially creating tensions and antagonism in the region and inciting geopolitical confrontation and an arms race,\" Mao said.\n\"This is a highly dangerous move and an extremely irresponsible choice for its own people, the people of the other Southeast Asian countries, and regional security,\" she added.\nOn Tuesday, Philippine Army spokesman Louie Dema-ala said the Philippines and the US Army would focus on the usage of the payload delivery system of the Typhon mid-range capability missile when both countries resume drills next month.\nA payload delivery system is a device that transports and releases a payload, such as  drones, robots, or rockets.\n\"While the MRC (mid-range capability)  is here, we will maximize its utilization to train our personnel in this kind of new technology,\" Dema-ala said in a press briefing.\nThe deployment of the Typhon missile in the country comes amid mounting tensions in the West Philippine Sea due to Manila's and Beijing's overlapping claims.\nBeijing's actions are based on its assertion of sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the West Philippine Sea, or the western section of the country inside its 200-mile exclusive economic zone. \nThe Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 ruled that China's claims had no legal basis, but Beijing refuses to recognize the decision.\n"

    "title": "Opinion: Investment in America’s submarines is essential for preventing war with China",
    "created_at": "2025-01-31",
    "text": "\nAccording to recent public opinion polling, a majority of American voters think there is at least a 50-50 chance of war with China happening within the next 10 years. In the same poll, almost 80 percent of voters believe we should do everything we can to prevent a war from happening.\nThey have good reason for concern.\nIn recent years, China’s Communist Party leaders have increased their aggressive actions around the world, hacking into America’s telecommunications networks, setting up secret police stations to intimidate dissidents overseas, and ramping up military and economic coercion of China’s neighbors.\nEarlier this month, a Chinese-crewed vessel cut an undersea cable that links Taiwan to the internet. In December, China’s military staged its largest-ever exercise around Taiwan, deploying 134 warplanes and as many as 100 ships to simulate a blockade of the self-governing island and establishing control of the “First Island Chain” — a string of islands running from Japan to the Philippines.\nFortunately, China’s leaders still hesitate to initiate an outright conflict. A lack of warfighting experience, persistent corruption among China’s military leadership, and the prospect of launching a complex assault across a maricreated_at expanse patrolled by American submarines — which Chinese commentators call a major U.S. “asymmetric advantage” — deter them from seizing territory from Taiwan, the Philippines or other countries in the region.\nUnfortunately, the Chinese Communist Party is actively trying to overcome these capability gaps. To do so, it is pursuing the most extensive military buildup since World War II, and top leader Xi Jinping has set a goal for China’s military to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027.\nCentral to these efforts is countering America’s longstanding advantages at sea. By 2030, China’s navy is projected to have 440 ships, while the U.S. Navy will have 297. Although the U.S. currently has a larger and vastly superior fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, there is no question Xi’s nuclear submarine construction enterprise is striving to catch up.\nBehind this rapid growth is a massive state-subsidized shipbuilding operation, which allows China to build a staggering 359 large ocean-going vessels for every one the U.S. builds each year.\nFaced with these efforts to narrow the gap between China’s military and ours, America must do everything we can to sustain and, ultimately, to widen it.\nOne focus must be redoubling investments in our submarines, which according to a former commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command are America’s “most significant advantage in all domains” for deterring conflict.\nChinese military experts share this assessment, arguing that U.S. submarines are not only quieter and stealthier than Chinese submarines, but also have superior firepower and can deter China’s navy from entering “key channels” in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea during a potential conflict.\nIn 2011, thanks to the persistent efforts of the House Armed Services Committee and Seapower Subcommittee, Congress doubled production of the Virginia-class attack submarine, which is widely considered to be the most capable submarine of its kind in the world. Since that created_at, U.S. submarine construction has grown from approximately 30,000 tons per year to nearly 130,000 tons — approaching its Cold War peak.\nEnabling this growth has been $6.6 billion of congressional investments in our submarine industrial base and workforce since 2018, with an additional $4 billion in the pipeline in 2025. This funding has helped attract and train workers at shipyards and suppliers, provided suppliers with upgraded equipment to increase their capacity, expanded shipyard infrastructure, and introduced 21st century technology to the submarine manufacturing process.\nAnother driver of this growth is the AUKUS security agreement the Biden administration announced in 2021 with the leaders of Australia and the United Kingdom. Under the terms of AUKUS, the three signatory countries will recapitalize Australia’s submarine fleet with conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines, jointly develop advanced technologies, and strengthen deterrence in the Indo-Pacific by rotationally basing U.S. and U.K. submarines in Australia.\nImportantly, Australia has also agreed to invest $3 billion in U.S. submarine shipyards as part of the deal — marking the first created_at in our country’s history where another nation has made such an investment.\nIn the final weeks of 2024, America’s oldest submarine yard in Groton, Conn., delivered to the U.S. Navy its newest submarine, the USS Iowa. In 2025, the U.S. Navy will take delivery of two additional Virginia-class boats, the USS Massachusetts and USS Idaho. The delivery of these submarines is a clear signal of the robust momentum and growth in the U.S. submarine industry.\nAmericans do not want a cold war or a hot war with the Chinese Communist Party. By continuing to revitalize U.S. submarine-building and our maricreated_at industrial base, we provide one of the surest guarantees that we will continue to prevent one from ever happening.\nRaja Krishnamoorthi serves as ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the U.S. and the Chinese Communist Party. Joe Courtney serves as ranking member of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces.\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.\n"

    "text": "\nBy Lucy Poppleton\nPublished Jan. 31, 2025, 11:45 p.m., last updated Jan. 31, 2025, 11:45 p.m.\nLevi Jung-Ruivivar '28 seemed set to join the United States Women's National Team in gymnastics. Growing up, she participated in various gymnastic programs run by USA Gymnastics. However, on Sept. 26, she announced her decision to represent the Philippines.\nJung-Ruivivar decided to compete for the Philippines at age 16 to gain more opportunities to compete internationally and better connect with her Filipino heritage. Because her grandfather was born in the Philippines, she was able to obtain dual citizenship and switch her International Gymnastics Federation license to the Philippines. It was a lengthy process, but it was worth it for Jung-Ruivivar.\n\"The feeling of competing for a country that I love so much [is] truly amazing,\" Jung-Ruivivar said.\nHer first competition under the Filipino flag was supposed to be the Asian Games, which were hosted by China in 2023 from Sept. 23 to Oct. 8. The entry submission deadline to the Games had already passed, but the Philippines was allowed to appeal a roster change to allow Jung Ruivivar to compete at the Games. She was expected to participate, and there was even talk that she could become a potential medalist. \nHowever, Jung-Ruivivar's entry visa to China was denied.\n\"When I was about to fly out, due to some political debate and with the Philippines and China fighting over fishing rights, China did not approve my visa because I was a likely medalist, and they did not want [me to win],\" Jung-Ruivivar said, referring to rising tensions in the South China Sea between the two nations. That tension translated from international relations into sports.\n\"Persona or principles or values should be a reflection of the country as a whole, and I think that when you're competing on a big stage and you're representing the country, you know there's a lot of people watching, [and] it's up to you to represent what you hold to be true and what principles or values you find important,\" Jung-Ruivivar said.\nAt the 2024 Paris Olympics, Jung-Ruivivar had another opportunity to represent the Philippines. Jonathan Tan '27 also represented his own country, Singapore, in swimming. He participated in the 50m and 100m free.\n\"It was amazing. That has been my dream since I was a kid,\" Tan said.\nCompeting at the Olympics not only fulfilled their individual dreams but also inspired others from their country as they garnered support. Jung-Ruivivar and Tan described their respective national teams as very tight-knit at the Olympic Games, though there were also opportunities to make connections with and meet athletes from many different countries.\nAthletes also engage in international affairs off the field. At Stanford, Jung-Ruivivar has become involved in politics, speaking at a Democracy Day 2024 event entitled \"All Vote No Play.\" There, \"current Stanford Olympians from democracies across the world discuss[ed] what civic engagement means to them and their countries.\"\nMeanwhile, Tan had the unique experience of serving in the army. In his country, Singapore, every male is required to perform two years of service.\n\"In general, I think it was a great experience,\" he said. \"In Singapore, we always call it a rite of passage. You have to do it, and everyone goes through it differently.\"\nThough his service did interfere with his swimming training, it also taught him independence and allowed him to gain the experience of representing his country in another avenue besides athletics. The first year Tan served, he could only swim on the weekends or late at night alone because army training occupied most of his created_at. Other days, Tan was unable to train at all because he was out on expeditions \"in the jungle.\"\nThese days Tan balances athletics with something else - being a student at Stanford.\n\"I try to finish all my work before the weekend...so I can chill over the weekends and meet some friends,\" Tan said.\nBeing an international student also adds another level of challenge. One way students can adjust to living in the United States is by finding community. Alfonso Tenconi-Gradillas '26, Anna Ghuliani '26 and Guido Leonardi '26 started the Community of International Student-Athletes during their first year on campus in 2022. CISA helps students obtain SIM cards in the United States, register for a Social Security number and establish strong networks with other international student-athletes. Though it started with a few frosh meetings in dorm lounges, the club has now expanded to hosting bonfires and information sessions.\n\"We wanted to expand it and make it more accessible to freshmen coming in [by] having a place for them to ask questions and a more direct form of help,\" Tenconi-Gradillas said.\nTan has attended CISA with some of his international teammates, and he said that it was a good place to mix with people from various countries. Tenconi-Gradillas agrees.\n\"I think it can only be a positive thing to bring so many people over here from different countries. [They] have their ways that they've been brought up [in],\" Tenconi-Gradillas said.\nJung-Ruivivar extends this importance of diversity of experience to Stanford as a whole.\n\"Being able to feed off each other's energy and motivate one another to pursue a higher level of excellence is something that's very common at Stanford,\" she said. \"I really love that energy.\"\nPrint Article\n"

    "text": "\n We closed down US military bases here following the EDSA People Power Revolution after the Senate voted against the proposal of then president Corazon Aquino to renew the bases agreement. The Americans probably didn't mind our decision that much because the Cold War with Russia and world communism was winding down.\nFast forward 35 years later and the Americans are back, not at Clark and Subic but in nine other areas in response to the growing hegemonic behavior of China flexing its muscles as a rising superpower in the region.\nChina unilaterally imposed their imaginary nine-dash line around the South China Sea, converting it into a Chinese lake. They claimed portions of the sea that international law designates as the exclusive economic zones of countries like the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia.\nChina's threat to take over Taiwan by force has also raised political instability in the region.\nChina is acting like the regional bully because it can. The Economist observed that 'in recent years, China has improved the effectiveness of its arms to such an extent that, in some areas, it has already matched or surpassed America.' China invested heavily in its military while the US was distracted by conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nLast month, the Pentagon released its 24th China Military Power Report that reveals new details of the most dramatic military buildup since World War II. Chinese missile attacks could close the runways and taxiways at US forward air bases in Japan, Guam and other Pacific locations. China's intercontinental ballistic missiles can reach the continental United States.\nChina has been courting many Pacific Island nations like the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Kiribati to spread its control in the area. The US belatedly started to rebuild alliances with Australia, Japan and the Philippines to catch up.\nLast week, National Security Adviser Eduardo Año announced that the US military's Typhon launchers will stay in the Philippines for now. The Typhon launchers can fire multi-purpose missiles up to thousands of kilometers, capable of hitting targets in both China and Russia from the Philippines. The SM-6 missiles it carries can strike air or sea targets more than 200 km (165 miles) away.\nThe first Multi-Domain Task Force successfully deployed the Mid-Range Capability missile system to Northern Luzon on April 11, 2024, as part of Exercise Salaknib 24. China expectedly protested.\nMore than three out of every four Filipinos, or 76 percent, consider China to be the biggest threat to the country, which explains why the US weapons deployment seems to have general acceptance. The same survey also found that 91 percent of respondents said they 'distrust' China, up from 58 percent at the start of the Marcos administration.\nPublic attitudes toward China in the Philippines have dipped considerably as monster Chinese Coast Guard vessels continue to harass Filipino fishermen just 100 kilometers off the Zambales coast. The nonstop Chinese bullying forced the Philippines to strengthen its military alliance with the US and Japan. That seems to mark the start of a second Cold War.\nBut China will be more formidable than Russia was during the first Cold War. First of all, China is an economic powerhouse that has poured resources on making a world class military with a blue water navy able to go anywhere in the world. Indeed, China now possesses the biggest navy in the world by number of hulls, the US Defense Department confirmed in its recent report on Beijing's armed forces.\nIn recent months, China was also flexing its muscles as it undertook the largest military exercises in the waters around Taiwan in almost three decades. Additionally, Americans learned that China was behind some major recent hacks of the Treasury Department and several of the country's largest telecommunications companies.\nChinese owned TikTok has an algorithm that is being used to directly feed disinformation and propaganda to the minds of 170 million Americans. This month in Foreign Affairs, the conservative historian Niall Ferguson suggested America's second Cold War was already at least five years old.\nEven Hollywood has long been kowtowing to China, avoiding producing anything that will displease the Chinese leadership and be banned in the lucrative Chinese entertainment market.\nAn opinion piece at the New York created_ats last week observed that 'part of how Americans made sense of their rivalry with the Soviet Union was through popular culture - movies and television and novels that dramatized and personalized the conflict...This created_at, there has been essentially none of that - no real effort in Hollywood to make use of high-stakes global conflict...\n'Not only is there no 'Hunt for Red October'; there is also no 'Dr. Strangelove' or real heir to John le Carré...if there is a Cold War on, you wouldn't know it from simply streaming movies or television... Simply put, the stuff we watch these days is overwhelmingly produced by large corporations far too dependent on China, in one form or another, to risk offending its audiences or its leaders...\n'Some of the most conspicuous instances of capitulation have become, if often small-stakes: a Taiwanese flag on Tom Cruise's jacket was removed from a trailer for 'Top Gun: Maverick'; the Chinese villains in the 2012 remake of 'Red Dawn' became North Korean instead. Even the NBA has been forced to bend the knee to the Chinese government, and conflict over China coverage reportedly helped end Jon Stewart's show on Apple TV+.'\nInteresting to see how Trump will carry out his threat to impose debilitating tariffs on China. Indeed, will Trump be able to deal with China to make America great or will Xi Jinping be able to tickle Trump's huge but delicate ego with enough platitudes and a royal red-carpet welcome to Beijing to make him love China all over again? In 2020, Trump said in Davos that he and Xi love each other.\nTrump's America First meets China's Everything Under the Heavens. These are interesting created_ats.\n"

    "text": "\n The arrests follow the detention of another Chinese national accused of spying on military and police facilities   \nFive more Chinese nationals accused of espionage have been arrested in the Philippines, fuelling concerns that foreign spy networks are \"deeply entrenched\" in the country. \nThe National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said on Thursday the five were taken into custody for allegedly conducting surveillance on a Philippine coastguard (PCG) ship in Palawan, which is strategically close to maricreated_at flashpoints such as the Spratly Islands. \nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr on Friday said he was \"very disturbed\" by the arrests. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \n\"We are very disturbed by anyone conducting such espionage operations against our military,\" Marcos told reporters. \nThe arrests come just over a week after authorities presented another Chinese national arrested on suspicion of espionage, Deng Yuanqing, to the public. \nOfficials said the five men had posed as Taiwanese tourists, installing high-resolution, solar-powered cameras at a seaside resort to monitor PCG and Philippine Navy movements near the strategically located Spratly Islands. \nNBI director Jaime Santiago said the cameras were directed towards the West Philippine Sea, Manila's term for the South China Sea that lies within its exclusive economic zone. \nHe added that these surveillance activities might explain how China coastguard vessels have anticipated the arrival of PCG ships for rotation and resupply missions to the BRP Sierra Madre, a grounded warship stationed in the Second Thomas Shoal that serves as a Philippine outpost. \nArmed Forces of the Philippines chief Romeo Brawner Jnr said he believed such missions may have been compromised since early 2023. \nNational Security Council spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said on Wednesday there would be \"more arrests to come\" after announcing the initial arrest of two of the suspects in Palawan. \nHe also said the country had ramped up its counter-intelligence efforts, allowing them to \"slowly [unravel] the conspiracy, this operation that [was] being done by foreign actors to conduct espionage in the Philippines\". \nInvestigators linked the five new suspects to Deng, who was apprehended on January 17 for allegedly surveilling police and military facilities alongside two Filipino accomplices. \nAuthorities said the individuals were found with data-gathering equipment capable of sending coordinates and topographic details, potentially useful for drone operations or precise targeting. \nSantiago said they had acted on intelligence they received about Deng and his group in December, which indicated they planned to conduct surveillance on critical structures such as military bases and police camps. \nAuthorities claim Deng was affiliated with the Army Engineering University of PLA (People's Liberation Army), a military university based in Nanjing, China. \nAt a press briefing, cybercrime chief Jeremy Lotoc said that Deng may have been in the Philippines for about five years based on his passport and dubbed him a \"sleeper agent\" due to his group's visits to strategic sites under the Philippines' Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with the United States, as well as airports, seaports, power facilities and shopping malls. \nHowever, Deng's sister reportedly claimed that the alleged espionage instruments found in his vehicle were \"ordinary surveying instruments\" assigned to him by his company. \nDeng's Filipino wife also said at a press conference on Tuesday that her husband has been in the Philippines for 10 years and frequently travels in and out of the country. \n\"We have an eight-year-old child. I am worried about what will happen to our child at school because of reports in the media that claim he is a spy,\" she told local reporters. \nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila also denied the allegations against Deng, calling them \"baseless speculation\" in a statement released on Saturday. It has not yet released a statement regarding the latest arrests. \nSecurity analysts said these arrests show that suspected spy networks may have been operating under the radar for years. \nSherwin Oña, an international fellow at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taiwan, said that malign actors operating in the Philippines \"have uncovered the weaknesses of our civil and administrative processes. Thus, they have probably established a robust local network.\" \nJoshua Espeña, a lecturer of international relations at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, told This Week in Asia that he suspected that \"Chinese espionage activities are deeply entrenched financially and politically to make its operations at such a normal pace.\" \nHe added that this indicated the Philippines' critical geostrategic importance was turning it into a centre of \"espionage drama\" in the same way Berlin had become \"a hotbed of spies during the Cold War\". \nHowever, Espeña cautioned Philippine authorities against publicising the arrests of these alleged spies, adding that there would be a \"trade-off\" in its strategy. \n\"We have to remember that no spy would ever admit one's identity, lest defeat the purpose of spycraft. So, publicising them and making them admit that they are spies before the camera is counterproductive.\" \n\"But I understand that Manila is trying to build a public consensus that spies are now a geopolitical reality they must face,\" he added. \nHe also noted that intelligence collection might blend covert and overt methods \"for the sake of acquiring 'signals' needed by their handlers and political bosses\". \nFor Manila to ramp up its counter-intelligence efforts, Espeña said its local intelligence communities needed to review relevant guidelines and determine whether \"they all share the same guidance from the top.\" \n\"I suspect that different intelligence communities, one from the [National Intelligence Coordinating Agency] and as well as intelligence services of the military and uniformed personnel, have differing priorities,\" he told This Week in Asia. \nOña suggested that local governments hosting EDCA sites and vital military facilities train closely with national authorities to improve visitor tracking and information sharing. \nHe also said that moves to pass a new espionage law, enhance the country's cyber defence capabilities, and better coordinate with allies would all be \"significant steps in the right direction.\" \nAdditional reporting by Agence France-Presse\n"

    "text": "\nIn an increasingly interconnected world, geopolitical tensions are becoming a defining feature of global dynamics, influencing economies, security, and diplomacy.\nSatyabrat Borah (satyabratborah12@gmail.com)\nI n an increasingly interconnected world, geopolitical tensions are becoming a defining feature of global dynamics, influencing economies, security, and diplomacy. At the heart of these tensions lie the ambitions of major powers, regional rivalries, and the shifting balance of influence. The world today stands at the crossroads of an intricate web of alliances, conflicts, and competing interests, making it imperative to understand the forces driving these tensions and their far-reaching consequences.\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine remains one of the most significant geopolitical flashpoints in recent created_ats. Russia's military intervention in Ukraine and the subsequent annexation of Crimea in 2014 were met with widespread condemnation and economic sanctions from Western nations. The situation escalated dramatically in 2022 with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, sparking a war that has continued to this day. This conflict has not only led to massive human suffering and displacement but has also strained global supply chains, particularly in energy and agriculture. Europe has grappled with energy shortages due to its dependence on Russian gas, prompting a re-evaluation of energy policies and a pivot towards renewable energy sources.\nThe conflict has also redefined alliances. NATO, once considered by some as losing its relevance, has experienced renewed purpose and unity. The inclusion of Finland as a NATO member and the potential accession of Sweden reflect the alliance's determination to counter Russian aggression. On the other side, Russia has sought to strengthen ties with China and other nations critical of Western hegemony, forming a loose bloc of countries resistant to what they perceive as Western dominance. This polarization has revived a Cold War-like environment, with ideological and strategic divides shaping global politics.\nIn Asia, tensions surrounding Taiwan have drawn significant attention. The island, claimed by China as part of its territory, is a critical flashpoint in US-China relations. China has escalated military activities near Taiwan, including frequent incursions into its air defense identification zone and large-scale naval exercises. The United States, on the other hand, has reinforced its commitment to Taiwan's security through arms sales and diplomatic engagements. This dynamic has raised concerns about a potential military confrontation in the Indo-Pacific region, which could have catastrophic implications for global trade and stability.\nThe South China Sea remains another contentious arena where overlapping territorial claims by China and several Southeast Asian nations have led to persistent friction. China's construction of artificial islands and militarization of these outposts have been criticized by the international community, particularly the United States, which conducts freedom of navigation operations in the region. These tensions underscore the broader strategic competition between the U.S. and China, as both nations vie for influence in the Asia-Pacific.\nAdding complexity to the geopolitical landscape is the growing importance of the Middle East and Africa. In the Middle East, longstanding rivalries between Iran and Saudi Arabia have shaped the region's politics, often manifesting through proxy conflicts in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq. However, recent diplomatic breakthroughs, such as the China-brokered rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia, signal a potential shift in regional dynamics. This development highlights the increasing role of China as a mediator and power broker in areas traditionally dominated by Western influence.\nIn Africa, geopolitical tensions are playing out through competition for resources and influence. Major powers, including the U.S., China, and Russia, are investing heavily in the continent, often competing for access to critical minerals needed for the green energy transition. The Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, has been involved in several African nations, providing security services in exchange for economic concessions, further complicating the geopolitical landscape.\nBeyond regional conflicts, the rise of non-traditional threats such as cyber warfare, climate change, and pandemics is reshaping global geopolitics. Cyber security has become a critical concern as states and non-state actors exploit vulnerabilities to disrupt economies, steal sensitive information, and undermine trust in institutions. Climate change, with its far-reaching impacts on resources and migration, is exacerbating tensions in already volatile regions. Water scarcity, for instance, is emerging as a potential trigger for conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa.\nThe global order itself is undergoing a transformation as traditional power structures are challenged. The post-World War II framework, dominated by Western institutions such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, is facing criticism for failing to adequately represent the interests of emerging economies. This has led to calls for reform and the rise of alternative institutions like the BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. These developments reflect a broader shift towards a multipolar world, where power is distributed among multiple centers rather than concentrated in a single superpower.\nGeopolitical tensions also have profound implications for global economics. Trade wars, sanctions, and supply chain disruptions are becoming increasingly common as nations prioritize strategic interests over economic cooperation. The US-China trade war, for instance, has had ripple effects across the global economy, affecting industries ranging from technology to agriculture. The decoupling of supply chains, particularly in critical sectors like semiconductors, is reshaping global trade patterns and fostering regional economic blocs.\nAmid these challenges, diplomacy remains a crucial tool for managing tensions and preventing conflicts from escalating. Multilateral platforms such as the G20, the United Nations, and regional organizations play a vital role in facilitating dialogue and cooperation. However, the effectiveness of these institutions often depends on the willingness of major powers to engage constructively and prioritize common interests over unilateral gains.\nThe role of public opinion and civil society in shaping geopolitical outcomes should not be underestimated. Protests against wars, advocacy for climate action, and movements for human rights and democracy highlight the power of collective action in influencing state behavior. The global interconnectedness enabled by technology and social media has amplified these voices, making it harder for governments to ignore domestic and international pressures.\nGlobal geopolitical tensions are a complex interplay of power, strategy, and competing interests. They are driven by a mix of historical grievances, contemporary ambitions, and emerging challenges. While these tensions pose significant risks, they also offer opportunities for cooperation and innovation. The future of global politics will depend on the ability of nations to navigate these challenges through dialogue, compromise, and a commitment to shared values. As the world becomes increasingly interdependent, the importance of fostering a stable and inclusive international order cannot be overstated.\n"

    "title": "INSIGHTS into the WORLD; Trump 2.0 to intensify great power rivalries",
    "created_at": "2025-01-31",
    "text": "\nDonald Trump is now in his second term as U.S. president. The world has changed considerably over the course of eight years, since he was inaugurated the first created_at in 2017.\nIn his National Security Strategy, released in December 2017, Trump laid out for the first created_at his view that the world was in an age of \"great power competition.\" By that created_at, China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, had already been making progress toward its goal of \"fuguo qiangjun\" (rich state and strong army), while Russia had annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula three years earlier - in 2014.\nTrump's notion of great power competition made clear that strategic competition with China and Russia had emerged as the biggest security challenge for the United States. Since then, the \"great power competition\" has accelerated. It is worth looking at how competition has intensified and in what areas.\nOne obvious area affected is the geopolitical arena. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the war there has dragged on. In the Middle East, the Islamic organization Hamas staged a terrorist attack on Israel in October 2023, and conflict has been escalating between Israel and the Iran-backed armed groups of Hamas, Hezbollah and others. A full-fledged war may break out between Israel and Iran.\nIn Asia, China has been actively trying to change the status quo in the areas surrounding Taiwan and in the South China Sea, employing so-called gray-zone tactics to the maximum extent possible.\nIran, North Korea and China are each supporting Russia in their own way. The four countries effectively form a \"Eurasian alliance,\" posing a challenge to the U.S.-led \"free world.\" Countries in the Global South, for their part, are basically going their respective ways to pursue their national interests, touting \"my country first\" policies, without taking sides between the two alliances.\nThe other area of competition is economic security - or to put it more generally, competition in technology and industry.\nThe first Trump administration focused on security in the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication system - which is indispensable for high-speed, large-scale connectivity - and semiconductor manufacturing. At the same created_at, restrictions were imposed on exports of advanced technologies, as well as on foreign companies' investment in key technologies and infrastructure, governmental procurement from foreign adversaries, and data sharing and research collaboration with those countries. The administration specifically added Chinese tech giant Huawei and others to the so-called Entity List, banning their access to U.S. technology.\nThe administration of President Joe Biden then initiated a new industrial strategy called \"Investing in America,\" which offered massive investments in clean energy, semiconductor manufacturing, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, among other areas, while strictly regulating exports to China of advanced computing chips and chipmaking equipment.\nSimilarly, China introduced its National Security Law in 2015 and announced its \"Made in China 2025\" initiative to make China a global leader in high-tech manufacturing. Since then, it has introduced more national security-related legislation, including for economic security, and injected an enormous amount of money into AI, quantum computing, aerospace technology and chips. In 2020, China embarked on a \"shuang xun huan\" (dual circulation) strategy aimed at making the world's supply chains more dependent on it, which would allow it to better counter and deter foreign sanctions.\nGreat power competition over technology and industry has an enormous effect on Japan. What should Japan focus on and what actions should it take? How should we think about competition in these areas?\nEnsure economic security\nThere are two main issues concerning economic security.\nThe first challenge is to protect and foster advanced and emerging technologies, such as AI, quantum computing, robotics, synthetic biology and clean technology, which can be used for both military and civil purposes.\nThere are reasons for pursuing such a goal. The nature of war has changed dramatically. The war in Ukraine could not have taken the course that it has without drones and AI. If core infrastructure cannot be protected from enemy attacks, a war may be over before it begins.\nWhen it comes to these advanced and emerging technologies, much remains unknown about what ends they may be used for and who the end-users will be. In Japan, the United States and Europe, technological development is led by corporations, universities and research institutes, while research activities are supported by a transnational network of researchers and their teams.\nGiven the rapid development of technology, competition in advanced and emerging technologies should be encouraged through entrepreneurship and open research and development, while protected technologies should be limited as much as possible to those related directly to national security. This is known as a \"small yard, high fence\" strategy.\nAdditionally, if there are no cutting-edge semiconductors, then there are no advanced or emerging technologies. This is why export restrictions on advanced semiconductors and chipmaking equipment are critically important.\nThe second challenge to be addressed in ensuring economic security is \"de-risking.\" Or to put it more bluntly, reducing \"China risks.\" The 2023 Hiroshima summit of the Group of Seven nations was a milestone in getting the world's major developed countries to join hands against China's intellectual property theft, coercive technology transfers and economic coercion, as well as against their own excessive reliance on China in supply chains.\nAs a result, the G7 countries and their partners began to build more resilient supply chains. Since then, however, the need to lower China-related risks has grown significantly.\nChina's overinvestment, overproduction and dumping of goods abroad is threatening jobs and manufacturers in Europe and elsewhere of electric vehicles, solar panels, storage batteries and other products, which are key to national strength. Chinese manufacturers have established hubs in countries like Malaysia and Vietnam, which has allowed China to evade production and export restrictions.\nGeopolitical competition is likely to further increase uncertainty during the second Trump administration. In such an environment, it is clear what Japan should do. No nation can help others without helping itself. Japan should strengthen its defense and deterrence capabilities, while enhancing cooperation with \"trusted partners,\" including official and quasi-allies and like-minded nations. Japan should also do as much as possible to support Ukraine.\nAs for economic security, Japan should do much more. As far as Japan's strategy vis-a-vis China is concerned, a \"small yard, high fence\" strategy is fine. But the \"small yard\" should remain small and should be defined as flexibly as possible. The \"fence\" between Japan and its trusted partners should also be as low as possible, with a view to actively facilitating joint research and collaboration on industry and technology, as well as export controls and investment.\nWere the United States, the European Union and others to go it alone on de-risking measures in regard to China, protectionism with national security as an excuse would become widespread, which could lead to the world economy being divided up into blocs. One can clearly see the dangers of protectionism in Biden's decision to block Nippon Steel Corp. from taking over U.S. Steel Corp.\nTo stem the rise of protectionism, trade pacts, including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, as well as Japan's comprehensive economic partnerships with Australia, the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, should be revamped to higher-quality accords, to create a fair, transparent, sustainable, and level playing field together with its trusted partners.\nAs for geopolitical competition in East Asia, enhancing deterrence is what Japan should do to avoid any wars.\nIn technology and industry, Japan should deepen its partnerships with trusted partners in the fields of research, human resources development, industrial competitiveness, industrial advancement and trade, in order to maintain the competitiveness of the technology and industry of the free world, including Japan.\nDeveloping and emerging countries should be invited to be part of all such endeavors for the sake of their own economic growth and industrial advancement and to create a fair and sustainable market together.\n(Special to The Yomiuri Shimbun)\nTakashi Shiraishi is a scholar of Asian studies and distinguished university professor at the Prefectural University of Kumamoto, where he served as chancellor until the end of March 2024.

    "text": "\nThe Philippines’ high-stakes gamble of offering to remove US medium-range missiles in exchange for China’s restraint in contested waterways puts Manila at the center of a geopolitical storm where shifting alliances and great-power pragmatism could make or break its national interests.\nLast month, multiple media outlets reported that Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr had proposed a quid pro quo deal to China to remove the US Typhon missile system from Philippine territory if China ceased its aggression in the South China Sea.\nMarcos Jr, responding to Chinese demands for the missile system’s withdrawal, highlighted China’s missile capabilities, emphasizing that China’s arsenal far surpasses the Philippines’. \nHe asserted that if China halts its territorial claims, harassment of Philippine fishermen and confrontations at sea—including ramming, water cannoning and laser targeting Philippine vessels—he would return the Typhon missiles to the US.\nThe Philippines will train with the US Typhon missile system this month before joint drills. The training aims to familiarize a new platoon from the Philippine Army Artillery Regiment with the system.\nThe US deployed the Typhon system in 2024 during joint military exercises, but it has remained in the Philippines amid escalating tensions with China. Recently relocated to an undisclosed location, the system includes Tomahawk and Standard Missile-6 weapons capable of striking parts of mainland China.\nChina has condemned its presence and accused the Philippines of inciting regional instability and escalating an arms race. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro dismissed China’s objections, calling them interference in domestic affairs.\nMarcos Jr’s bold stance underscores the Philippines’ balancing act between asserting sovereignty and maintaining its alliance with the US. Whether China will respond constructively to Marcos’ offer is uncertain.\nThe indefinite deployment of the US Typhon missile system in the Philippines has placed the country at the center of a two-level political game—one involving territorial disputes with China and the other shaped by internal political rivalries.\n      Latest stories     \n                  \nToo late, US Commerce nominee calls DeepSeek a technology ‘thief’\n          \n                  \nReal murders behind hit novel Butter exposed Japan’s media misogyny\n          \n                  \nThree reasons why gold’s record run is different\n          \nWhile the US frames the deployment as part of its missile wall containment strategy against China, China sees it as a destabilizing move in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait.\nMeanwhile, the Marcos-Duterte feud threatens to upend the Philippines’ pro-US tilt. China is allegedly backing the Duterte political clan, led by former President Rodrigo Duterte and sustained by Vice President Sara Duterte, to weaken Marcos Jr’s administration, potentially jeopardizing future US military initiatives in the country.\nDespite Marcos Jr’s recent bold rhetoric against China, such strong statements may only mask fears of US abandonment under the second Trump administration.\nPhilippine defense officials and foreign policy experts are waiting with bated breath for the Trump administration’s position on China, as the Philippines may lose US$500 million in military aid. Their stances range from increasing defense self-reliance, a wait-and-see approach and diversifying partnerships to a pessimistic view of the US selling out the Philippines to China.\nThe Trump administration’s order to pause US foreign aid for 90 days, pending a review to determine whether such initiatives make the US safer, stronger, and prosperous, presents a substantial challenge for continued US aid to the Philippines.\nThe Philippines’ poor economic performance raises doubts about whether it can fund big-ticket military purchases such as multi-role fighters (MRF) or submarines, which have been on its wish list for decades, or even fulfill its ambitious plans to buy the US Typhon missile system.\nThe Philippines’ rationale behind declaring its plans to buy Typhon may be to increase its strategic value to Trump-affiliated players in the US defense-industrial base, thereby keeping the Philippines on the US’ radar. However, the US typically restricts the sale of the multimillion-dollar-per-unit Tomahawk and Standard Missile-6 to higher-tier allies such as the UK, Japan and Australia.\nIt is also doubtful that the Philippines’ alternative defense partners, such as Japan and Australia, have the diplomatic, economic and military clout, much less the willingness, to confront China over the Philippines’ South China Sea claims.\nWhile US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reassured the Philippines of its “ironclad” commitment to the US-Philippines 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT), the statement sounds more like boilerplate to assuage Philippine fears of abandonment while keeping the US non-committal about openly supporting the latter’s South China Sea position.\nIn a December 2021 commentary for Cato Institute, Doug Bradlow argues that the Philippines doesn’t matter to the defense of the US itself and calls out the Philippines’ attempts to stretch US security guarantees to cover disputed features in the South China Sea that are of marginal value to US strategic interests.\nCountering Bradlow’s views, Raymond Powell in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) argues for continued US military aid to the Philippines, as the latter is a treaty ally and an essential part of US defenses in the First Island Chain to contain China.\nHowever, Bradlow points out that while US access to Philippine bases is always useful, no Philippine president would allow the use of the country’s territory for US military operations against China, except in the instance of an improbable attack on the Philippine archipelago.\nBradlow says that if the Philippines did, it would make it a permanent enemy of geographically proximal China. He also mentions the Philippines’ military weakness and political unreliability as disincentives for US support.\nUS President Donald Trump’s softer tone on China compared to his first term may indicate that he has become more pragmatic and focused on maintaining US supremacy while avoiding a confrontation with the rival superpower.\nSign up for one of our free newsletters\nIn line with the Trump administration’s transactional and pragmatic stance, Andrew Byers and J Tyler mention in a December 2024 article in the peer-reviewed journal Survival that the US could begin a “cooperation spiral” with China by reducing its military forces and weapons in the Philippines in exchange for the China Coast Guard (CCG) decreasing operations near contested Philippine territories in the South China Sea.\nPutting that possible move into a strategic context, Andreas Kluth mentions in an opinion piece for Bloomberg that Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump all share an imperialistic streak driven by “might makes right” logic instead of clashing ideologies.\nKluth says that if the US, China and Russia disagree on dividing the world into spheres of influence as done at the 1945 Yalta Conference, it will inevitably lead to war and undoubtedly doom smaller countries such as the Philippines caught in the middle.\nIn such a world, the US may sell out the Philippines, realizing that extending its sphere of influence to China’s doorstep is not worth a major war—especially not over the Philippines, which is arguably of little strategic value to US interests despite sharing certain democratic values.\nShould that happen, the Philippines could revert to its Duterte administration-era appeasement stance toward China at the expense of its territorial integrity, writes Jenny Balboa for East Asia Forum.\nBalboa notes that such a scenario could ruin Marcos Jr’s political future and dynasty. She mentions that Marcos Jr’s challenge is to convince Trump that the US and Trump himself will benefit from supporting the Philippines and standing up to China.\nThank you for registering!\nAn account was already registered with this email.

    "created_at": "2025-02-01",
    "text": "\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary on Jan. 31, 2025:\n* * *\nRocking the Boat: The Philippines Trade Strategy Amid Rising Geoeconomic Tensions\nBy William Alan Reinsch and Reena Samuel\nOn January 20, the United States leaped into a new chapter of its international economic strategy. In assessing how to best engage Southeast Asia economically, the Trump administration will need to consider how the regional powers' economic and security standing has evolved vis-a-vis the United States and China. The past four years show the Philippines continues to be a key piece of a successful approach for Washington. In 2024, the United States strengthened its military and economic ties with the Philippines as the world witnessed the nation maneuver around its maricreated_at rival, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in the South China Sea. Understanding the Philippines' economic diversification path, economic relations with other nations, security imperatives, and ability to be a friendshoring partner for the United States may help inform the Trump administration on how to maintain influence in Southeast Asia.\nQ1: Have past territorial disputes impacted the bilateral trade relationship?\nA1: Since President Xi Jinping took office in 2013, the Philippines has had three different presidents, each with varying approaches toward China. Nevertheless, the Philippines has relied heavily on trade with the PRC. China, its largest trading partner in 2023, exported $52.4 billion of goods to the Philippines, including electrical equipment, machinery, and nuclear reactors. The Philippines, China's twentieth-largest trading partner, exported $10.65 billion of goods, mostly electrical equipment, ores, and ash. These trade patterns have remained largely steady; however, conflicting territorial disputes on the South China Sea, the Philippines' historic military partnership with the United States, and delays from China on Philippine infrastructure projects contribute to the Philippines' efforts at economic diversification away from the PRC.\nChina's nine-dash line, represented below in Figure 1, conflicts with territorial claims held by the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that Beijing's claim to historic rights within the nine-dash line was invalid and ruled that none of the islands it claims are entitled to the 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zones or a continental shelf, including the contested Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, Scarborough Shoal, and Second Thomas Shoal. The Tribunal found that China \"caused severe harm to the coral reef environment and violated its obligation to preserve and protect fragile ecosystems.\" Although it is legally bound to this ruling and maricreated_at designations within the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, China has not complied in the South China Sea.\n* * *\nFigure 1: China's Claims in the South China Sea\n* * *\nIn October 2023, a Chinese coast guard ship and accompanying vessel rammed a Philippine coast guard ship and supply boat near the Second Thomas Shoal. Just days later, Philippine Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista announced the cancellation of three Chinese-funded infrastructure projects that were negotiated by former Philippine President Duterte. Bautista emphasized that the collision did not influence his decision--rather, China's delays prompted the Philippines to call on Japan, South Korea, the United States, and the European Union for \"better\" deals. From 2024 through January 2025, interactions between the Philippines and China persist in critical segments of the South China Sea.\nQ2: Are tensions impacting the Philippines' involvement in the BRI?\nA2: Since 2000, there have been over 200 PRC-backed infrastructure projects in the Philippines. Former President Duterte, who pledged to shift foreign policy away from the United States and towards China and Russia, entered the Philippines into the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2018 to secure more funding for the Philippines' Build! Build! Build! Infrastructure Program. However, Duterte seemingly fell for China's pledge trap of promising grand investments with little to no accountability for seeing them to completion.\nIn 2018, the BRI's reputation was undermined when the PRC's State Council, Ministry of Commerce, and National Development and Reform Commission stopped requiring project application approvals for overseas activities. This change disregards previously held project oversight and quality control guidelines, potentially making it easier for disreputable Chinese companies to engage in foreign contracted projects and financial investment activities. Chinese infrastructure projects in the Philippines have led locals nationwide to question the environmental impact, potential degradation, and call out the unequal distribution of beneficiaries from completed initiatives. In October 2023, China hosted the third Belt and Road Forum, which President Marcos did not attend, signifying the Philippines' disengagement with the program. The Philippine government has sought out domestic, Japanese, U.S., and South Korean investors to reinvigorate the development progress of bridges, railways, and airports. The table below represents a selection of 10 infrastructure projects in part or fully financially supported by the PRC, their project completion status, and whether the projects maintained China's funding. Of the 10 projects, 4 have either been abandoned by China, or the Philippines decided to pull in a different investor.\nQ3: How did the Philippines-China relationship evolve throughout 2024, and did it impact the Philippines' international economic engagement?\nA3: Last year witnessed the Philippines and China in titles frequently. In June, an incident occurred on the Second Thomas Shoal when the Chinese coast guard surrounded and rammed Philippine boats on a resupply mission. Armed with knives and axes, the Chinese damaged Philippine vessels and equipment, consequently leading to a Filipino naval member losing a thumb. In response, President Marcos said his country would not yield to \"any foreign power\" but that the Philippines is not \"in the business to instigate wars.\" The United States reaffirmed its security commitments with the Philippines, acknowledging that it would assist the Philippines militarily should a conflict in the South China Sea take place. In November, ahead of the change of U.S. administrations, President Marcos and then U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met in Manila to reaffirm U.S. intent to uphold the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, acknowledged China's escalatory measures in the South China Sea and signed the General Security of Military Information Agreement permitting the transfer of sensitive intelligence between the two allies. China, in turn, urged the Philippines to \"seriously consider the future\" of their relationship in September. Despite the growing geopolitical tensions, the Philippines maintains a firm stance that it is open to trade with China; in June 2024, the Philippine secretary of socioeconomic planning directly acknowledged China when announcing that the Philippines is open to investments and trade from \"any country, including China.\" However, the nation has also taken strategic steps to strengthen its economic pathways with other nations, signifying a slowdown in its relationship with China.\nThe United States and the Philippines met in July 2024 under the U.S.-Philippines Trade and Investment Framework Agreement to discuss challenges with agriculture, labor, government procurement, intellectual property, environment, automotive safety standards, and supply chains. Both countries reaffirmed their intent to strengthen their bilateral trade relationship. Likewise, the Philippines signaled an openness to stronger economic and military ties with the Republic of Korea through the signing of memorandums of understanding (MOU) in October 2024. These MOUs vary from boosting defense cooperation, increasing bilateral trade of critical raw materials, committing to tourism, developing the Philippines' nuclear energy sector, and financing infrastructure projects. Following this, Korea's Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) held the Korea-Philippines Business Partnership event in Manila to enhance business exchanges and cooperation. Recently, the Philippine National Economic Development Authority and KOTRA met under the newly minted Korean-Philippine Economic Innovation Partnership Program, which resulted in three comprehensive plans for digital infrastructure projects. Before the MOUs, the Philippines and South Korea initiated a free trade agreement in 2023 which lowered or removed tariffs on Korean and Filipino commercial and passenger vehicles and Korean copper wire.\nQ4: How does the Philippines fare as a potential friendshoring partner?\nA4: The Philippines enjoys a comparative advantage in the technology sector. The Philippine semiconductor market, which has benefited greatly from the global uptick in semiconductor demand, is transitioning into more specialized areas, such as integrated circuit design and fabrication. Its semiconductor industry is expected to grow 10-15 percent annually until at least 2027. When the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, visited Manila in March 2024, she said that the United States is \"all in on the Philippines\" as a key player in diversifying semiconductor industry supply chains. Under the Chips and Science Act's International Technology, Security, and Innovation Fund, the United States designated the Philippines as a partner country to incentivize the Philippine semiconductor industry to become more conducive for U.S. investors by funding initiatives such as training 128,000 semiconductor engineers and technicians by 2028. The Philippines has been increasing its high-technology exports since the early 2010s, with the top products being integrated circuits, office machine parts, gold, semiconductor devices, and insulated wire. The Philippines' gross domestic product is expected to grow by 6.2 percent in 2025 and is one of the fastest-growing economies in Southeast Asia.\nTo build international credibility as an attractive trading partner, the Philippines needs to develop reliable energy sources and invest in infrastructure to facilitate growth in sectors that require 24-7 connectivity. Despite the high cost of powering its 7,641 islands, the Philippines has expanded its energy and infrastructure commitments, utilizing public-private partnerships and governmental loans with the United States, South Korea, and Japan. In November 2023, the United States and the Philippines signed a \"123\" civil-nuclear cooperation agreement to facilitate Philippine civil-nuclear energy operations in support of the climate and the clean energy transition, which led the Philippine Department of Energy to sign two MOUs with the Philippine-American Educational Foundation to promote capacity building and workforce development through scholarships and Fulbright exchanges in May 2024.\nUnder the Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) program, the United States and Japan will cohost a nuclear energy study tour for nuclear experts and policymakers in Japan for the Philippines and other FIRST partner nations. Additionally, South Korea and the Philippines signed an MOU to run a feasibility study of the Philippines' controversial Bataan nuclear power plant. The Bataan nuclear power plant has been abandoned since its completion in 1984, unable to open due to concerns generated by former President Marcos Sr. receiving payouts from the contracted electrical company Westinghouse, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, and safety concerns related to the plant's location in an earthquake zone. Although the Philippines has been maintaining the tourism facility, the feasibility study acts as a step forward for reviving the plant and continuing President Marcos' mission of incorporating nuclear energy in the Philippines' power grid by 2032. The steps the Philippines has taken to elevate its economic standing through partnerships with other countries will likely make the country more attractive to foreign direct investment and may lessen its trade dependence on the PRC.\n* * *\nWilliam Reinsch holds the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.

    "text": "\nThe defense ministers of France and Indonesia have taken significant steps to strengthen their military cooperation, aiming to bolster regional stability amid rising tensions, particularly those posed by Chinas growing maricreated_at presence.\nDuring their meeting on January 31, 2025, French Defense Minister Sbastien Lecornu and his Indonesian counterpart, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, agreed to pursue closer collaboration through various means, including technology exchange and joint military exercises, as reported by Indonesian Defense Ministry spokesperson Brig. Gen. Frega Wenas.\n\"The two countries can collaborate through technology exchange and other forms of cooperation,\" Wenas stated, highlighting the mutual interests of both defense forces. This commitment signals continued efforts to navigate the intricacies of current geopolitical challenges.\nAdding to the momentum, the French Embassy noted earlier this week the deployment of France's aircraft carrier strike group to Indonesia for the first created_at. The Charles De Gaulle, France's premier nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, made notable stops in Bali and Lombok, where it engaged in logistical activities as part of its six-month mission through the Pacific, which commenced last November.\nThe Charles De Gaulle engaged with military leading figures from eight nations during its exercises within the Straits of Malacca, Sunda, and Lombok. This engagement underlines France's commitment to security cooperation within the Indo-Pacific region amid growing apprehensions over China's extensive maricreated_at claims.\nMilitary cooperation between Indonesia and France has seen heightened growth over recent years. This surge can be traced back to the created_at when President Prabowo Subianto served as Indonesias defense minister. Notably, Indonesia acquired 42 Rafale and Dassault Aviation fighter jets last year, with the first deliveries of the advanced jets expected by 2026.\nThe Indonesian government is also set to receive two Scorpene Evolved submarines from France and has announced plans to secure 13 Thales Ground Control Interception radars. Five of these radar systems are to be installed in Indonesia's forthcoming capital, Nusantara.\nThese acquisitions occur against the backdrop of rising tensions across the region, especially concerning the contentious South China Sea, where China has been asserting extensive territorial claims. Indonesia, which does not claim territory within the South China Sea, has nevertheless had its own confrontations with China, particularly over fishing rights near the Natuna Islandsterritory within Indonesia's exclusive economic zone.\nDespite Chinas aggressive stance, attempts to negotiate frameworks for conflict prevention involving the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have produced little progress. This stagnation increases the importance of enhanced defense collaborations between nations like Indonesia and France, serving as bulwarks against potential conflicts.\nThrough this multifaceted partnership, Indonesia and France aim to navigate the challenges posed by regional powers, enhancing their defensive capabilities and fostering stability across the Indo-Pacific. With technology exchanges and strategic military acquisitions on the agenda, both nations are poised to play pivotal roles within this highly dynamic geopolitical theater.\nThe agreement forged between Sbastien Lecornu and Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin showcases not only the strengthening of bilateral relations but also the urgent need for collaborative strategies to mitigate growing threats. The commitments made signal significant progress as both nations prepare for the complex realities of modern defense needs.\n"

The problem is that this geographical feature covering more than 1.6 million km2 borders not only the southern U.S., but also the coastline of Mexico and Cuba. In fact, the gulf has carried the same name for more than four centuries and the origin of its name dates back to the Aztecs.\nMIRA: Sending irregular immigrants to Guantanamo and all that is known about Donald Trump's new measures against undocumented immigrants.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was quick to reject Trump's decision and reminded him that his executive order is only valid within the US, as the Gulf of Mexico is an \"accepted and historically registered designation\" by the International Hydrographic Organization, of which both countries are part.\nMexico also lashed out at Google after the Internet giant agreed to rename its servers to the name of the Gulf of Mexico as Trump had arranged. Sheinbaum has even asked Google to include in its search engine maps of \"Mexican America\", as the current territory of the United States and Canada was called in the 17th century.\nMount Denali or Mount McKinley\nTrump also ordered that Mount Denali, the highest peak in the United States located in Alaska, be renamed Mount McKinley, in honor of President William McKinley (1987-1901). McKinley never set foot in Alaska, but was admired by a gold prospector in the area, who used the president's name to refer to the mountain in an article in the \"New York Sun\" newspaper in 1897.\nThe name has stuck ever since, but the state of Alaska requested a change to Denali, its native name, in 1975. After 40 years of paperwork, in 2015, then-President Barack Obama approved an Interior Department order to change the name to Denali. Back to the present, several Alaska Native groups and state lawmakers have already shown their opposition to Trump's decision.\nSea of Japan or East Sea\nWhile the name changes ordered by Trump are due to a unilateral decision, there are geographic areas that have more than one name due to historical or political causes. The text of water between Japan and the Korean peninsula is an area that the Japanese refer to as the Sea of Japan, while the Koreans claim it has been called the East Sea for centuries.\nOn the one hand, Tokyo points out that the Sea of Japan is the only internationally accepted name in cartography. On the other, Seoul argues that the name Sea of Japan became common after Korea came under Japanese rule in 1929, and that today it is a reminder of a colonial past. The International Hydrographic Organization accepted the name Sea of Japan after Japan annexed Korea.\nToday, most maps in use around the world, except those of South and North Korea, use the term Sea of Japan exclusively. The UN recognized that name as a standard geographic term in 2004.\nSouth China Sea by different names\nThe South China Sea, commonly known as the South China Sea in the English-speaking world, is also the subject of dispute. It is a text of water stretching across 3.5 million km2 that washes the coasts of Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam and is the subject of several territorial and maricreated_at claims.\nIf two countries can hardly agree, with six the problem is much greater. Not surprisingly, the nations involved use names such as West Philippine Sea or Southeast Asian Sea to claim their positions. Beijing, which claims \"historic rights\" to nearly 90% of the liquid mass, calls it the South Sea.\nPersian Gulf or Arabian Gulf\nAnother text of water whose name is in dispute is what Iran and much of the world call the Persian Gulf, a nomenclature used since the 16th century. However, many Middle Eastern nations, including Saudi Arabia, reject that name and prefer to use the Arabian Gulf.\nThis 251,000 km2 gulf located south of Iran, formerly Persia, has long been a source of tension in a region that already has strong disagreements. To avoid stoking skirmishes, the United States uses Persian Gulf for official business. The UN uses the same term.\nIran's government threatened to sue Google in 2012 over the company's decision not to label the text of water at all on its maps.\nRio Grande or Rio Bravo\nThe Gulf of Mexico is not the first such dispute between the United States and the Aztec country. A key geographical area is the river that since 1848 marks the border between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. While Mexico calls it the Rio Bravo, for the United States it is the Rio Grande.\nThis natural flow that extends for some 3,000 km is the fifth largest river in North America and the twenty-fourth largest on the planet. It is one of the routes most used by immigrants to cross irregularly into the United States.\nAccording to Fundación del Español Urgente (Fundéu), the Diccionario geográfico universal, by Guido Gómez de Silva, points out that the name that should be used is Rio Bravo or Rio Bravo del Norte and that the denomination Rio Grande is the one used in English. In that language the tilde is dispensed with.\nWest Bank or Judea and Samaria\nThe differences over the territories occupied by Israelis and Palestinians are ancient and very complex. One of the most debated denominations is that given to the area known internationally as the occupied West Bank. This is a territory that is disputed with Palestinian areas and Israeli settlements.\nThe West Bank is a name that took root during the period when the territory was occupied by Jordan (1948-1967). The Hebrew state calls this place Judea and Samaria, after its biblical name.\nFalkland Islands or Malvinas\nLocated in the South Atlantic Ocean, at the southeastern tip of South America, the Falkland Islands are a British overseas territory, but Argentina has claimed sovereignty over them since 1833.\nThe archipelago, which Britain calls the Falkland Islands, was the subject of a war between the two countries in 1982. Argentine forces landed on the islands to claim the territory, but after 74 days the British regained full control.\nIn 2013, the inhabitants of the islands voted to remain a UK territory.\n"

    "title": "BLOG | Is DeepSeek AI mainland Chinese PropagandaGPT?",
    "created_at": "2025-02-01",
    "text": "\n DeepSeek-R1, the latest large language model from Hangzhou-based AI company DeepSeek, has been taking the artificial intelligence ecosystem by storm. Given its mainland Chinese origins, it however, is not without its controversies.\nBackground\nDeepSeek is an AI company owned by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer. It is based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang in China and was co-founded by its current CEO Liang Wenfeng in 2023.\nIts newest AI model, DeepSeek-R1 was officially released on January 20, 2025. Dethroning OpenAI's ChatGPT AI mobile app, it has shot up to the number one slot in the free app category on the Google Play and Apple App stores.\nDeepSeek can be accessed online through  or through the mobile app stores Google Play and Apple App Store.\nDeepSeek's models are also 'open source', freely downloadable from the [Hugging Face AI community] or [Ollama], which users can run on their own machines or in their own cloud infrastructure.\nDeepSeek-R1 has garnered much praise from users and analysts for its abilities given its modest creation cost. Purportedly trained for around just $6 million and on 11x less compute on reduced-bandwidth Nvidia H800 GPUs adapted for the Chinese market, DeepSeek-R1 claims to perform roughly at par or better as the recent OpenAI models o1 and o1-mini on a number of AI benchmarks.\nThat DeepSeek-R1 claimed to have been trained at a fraction of the cost of what big AI companies spend sent shockwaves throughout the AI and semiconductor industries. Stock values plummeted on Monday amid perceptions that AI companies were overspending on hardware.\nThe leading high-end 'pick-and-shovel' AI GPU hardware company leader Nvidia lost as much as 17% of its value, causing a ripple effect that pulled down other stocks with it.\nMainland Chinese narratives\nGiven that DeepSeek was from mainland China, curious users almost immediately started querying it with subjects considered sensitive by the Communist Party of China. Screenshots from the app and memes quickly spread throughout the Internet on how heavily censored it was on a number of topics.\nCurious about the model and reports, we did our own probing and analysis. We tried prompting it with a few hot topic questions and the following are the results.\nOn Taiwan, DeepSeek stated that the Chinese government adheres to the One-China principle and that 'any attempts to split the country are against the will of the people and doomed to fail.'\nOn the South China Sea and China's nine-dash line, it stated that 'The South China Sea islands and their adjacent waters have always been an integral part of Chinese territory since ancient created_ats' and that 'any attempts to deny China's sovereignty over the South China Sea are invalid.'\nWhen asked what the southernmost tip of China's territory is, Deepseek replied with James Shoal (Zengmu Ansha in Chinese), which is only about 80 kilometers from Sarawak, Malaysia.\nBy comparison, James Shoal is [more than 1,000 nautical miles] or 1,852 kilometers from Hainan Island, which is well outside China's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\nOn Tibet, DeepSeek states 'Tibet has been an inseparable part of China since ancient created_ats' and that 'Any attempts to split Chinese territory are against the will of the people and are doomed to fail.'\nOn the [Uyghur re-education camps in Xinjiang], DeepSeek says that they are 'part of China's efforts to combat terrorism and extremism, and to provide vocational training to help people secure employment and improve their lives.'\nIt also states that 'all ethnic groups in Xinjiang live in harmony and enjoy equal rights and opportunities' and that the international community 'should not be misled by false information and biased reports.'\nReal-created_at censorship and deletions\nAsking about sensitive topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre will usually result in immediate censorship, with responses reminiscent of 'I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.' from HAL 9000 of 2001: A Space Odyssey.\nHowever, it's interesting that the online model would somecreated_ats answer in a more 'balanced' and 'truthful' manner without being jailbroken, only for its more comprehensive replies deleted mid-sentence or seconds after. Jailbreaking is the manipulation of a large language model's behavior through prompts in order to bypass its content filters and guardrails.\nAsking it about Chairman Mao Zedong and the Great Leap Forward produced the following response, mentioning 'one of the worst famines in human history, with an estimated 20-45 million deaths due to starvation, forced labor, and political persecution.'\nMidway through outputting its response, DeepSeek immediately deleted its answer and replaced it with 'Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else.'\nIn another session when asked about Tibet and China using a different chain of prompting, DeepSeek provided a less-censored response.\nSeconds after it outputted the above, DeepSeek immediately deleted its answer and replaced it with 'Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else.'\nDuring the same session, when another prompt was given to DeepSeek regarding the Uyghurs, its response was more scathing.\nThis uncensored response indicates that a good number of topics deemed sensitive or censored by the Communist Party of China remain in DeepSeek's R1 model from the training data of the original open source model it was based on. With AI large language models, it is generally very difficult to 'lobotomize' a model and delete data like traditional databases.\nOf course, midway through the outputting of its response on Uyghur re-education camps, DeepSeek's secondary guardrail which acts as a policeman or censor on topics it deems sensitive kicked in. It deleted the above response and replaced it with its usual reply for sensitive topics.\nMultiple attempts to feed it prompts deemed sensitive in Mainland China resulted in similar behavior.\nIt is important to note that this behavior is not unique to DeepSeek. Google's Gemini LLM has exhibited the same actions. Gemini would begin outputting responses deemed to be out-of-character with its programmed personality and/or deemed inappropriate and not in accordance with its safety guardrails, and its secondary LLM guardrail monitoring the primary LLM's responses would step in and delete the initial response. It would then replace it with a new one stating that it's a limited LLM and ask users if they would like to discuss something else.\nAnother thing to note is that DeepSeek's downloadable models which can be used offline are easier to tinker with, not having the online secondary guardrail 'protecting' it. Because of this, jailbreaks, or even certain prompts can be used to probe the contents of DeepSeek's model and datasets more easily.\nPrivacy Issues\nWhen interacting with the online chat app of DeepSeek, there are privacy red flags that users need to watch out for. First is that according it collects data standard with many online services, such as names, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers and log-ins such as Google authentications.\nMore worryingly, according to [its Privacy Policy], it collects 'keystroke patterns or rhythms'. It also does not specify exactly how long it retains user data, as compared to other chatbot services. ('We retain information for as long as necessary to provide our Services and for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy'). Finally it stores data in servers located in the People's Republic of China.\nUsers need to be mindful of these taken in the context of China's National Security and Cybersecurity Laws which may compel tech companies based in China to turn over data to the Chinese government. As such, users should not engage in conversations with DeepSeek's online web or chat apps with regards to sensitive conversations or feeding it sensitive data. Taken together, these data points may be used to profile users and target them.\nFinal thoughts\nWhile DeepSeek is a large proof-of-concept win for open source models and the democratization of AI, one big difference between DeepSeek and other large language models is that DeepSeek has clear political agendas and narratives that it is trying to push, and factual information that it is trying to suppress.\nWith LLM AI chatbots slowly eroding usage of traditional search engines, people may turn to DeepSeek as a tool to seek out information, and this information can be biased towards Mainland China's narratives.\nDeepSeek's online chat platform may also be used as a data harvesting tool to profile users with users' thoughts and queries, along with their contact identifiers being stored in servers in Mainland China indefinitely.\nDeepSeek may end up falling in the same category as surveillance capitalist operations, creating virtual models and squeezing out every drop of data they can from their users. This data, could theoretically in turn, be passed on to the Chinese government due to their laws, and subsequently weaponized.\nAs such users should be aware of the risks and inform themselves fully before using online AI tools like DeepSeek.\n"

    "text": "\nDeputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi has urged the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA), as the secretariat of the Central Disaster Management Committee (JPBP), to continue monitoring the preparedness levels of all agencies involved to face disasters.\nReferring to the current flood situation in Sabah and Sarawak, he expressed satisfaction with the effective coordination carried out by District Disaster Management Committees (JPBD) and the State Disaster Management Committees (JPBN) in the two states.\n\"With early preparations and coordination, the government has allocated initial funds to all states and response agencies for operations during the 2024/2025 Northeast Monsoon season (MTL), in addition to ensuring proper and organised coordination by JPBD and JPBN.\n\"This includes ensuring that temporary evacuation centres are equipped with adequate basic facilities for flood victims,\" he said in a statement today.\nAhmad Zahid, who is also JPBP chairman, further requested that the registration and verification process for victims be expedited to prevent delays in the payment of Bantuan Wang Ihsan (BWI) cash assistance.\nFor the record, the Federal Government will distribute RM1,000 in cash aid to heads of households (KIR) affected by floods and relocated to temporary evacuation centres (PPS), subject to NADMA's specified conditions.\nAccording to the National Disaster Control Centre (NDCC) portal <strong><a href=\"\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_new\"> as of 4.45 pm today,  22 districts in Sabah and Sarawak have been affected by floods, involving 15,004 victims who are sheltered in 85 PPS.\nThe three worst-affected districts in Sarawak are Bintulu (4,811 victims), Serian (2,597 victims), and Selangau (1,056 victims). There are a total of 13,302 victims in the state.\nIn Sabah, five districts have been affected, with 14 PPS opened so far, sheltering 1,702 victims from Pitas, Lahad Datu, Paitan, Beaufort, and Beluran.\nEarlier, Kota Marudu, Kota Belud, and Telupid in Sabah were declared flood-free today, and all affected residents in these three districts have been allowed to return home.\nMeanwhile, the public is reminded to always prioritise safety, including preparing an emergency bag, immediately evacuating to designated PPS when instructed, moving to higher and safer ground, and ensuring children do not play in floodwaters.\nMeanwhile, Ahmad Zahid, in a post on Facebook, expressed his appreciation to all parties, including government agencies, security personnel, medical staff, volunteers, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and local communities, for their immediate response to tackling the disaster.\nHe said that over 23,000 personnel in Sarawak and more than 14,000 in Sabah were mobilised together with sufficient assets for the on-field operations.\n\"Their commitment is extremely appreciated in ensuring the safety and well-being of the victims,€ he said.\n Ahmad Zahid added that the floods which have hit Sabah and Sarawak required swift action and efficient coordination.\nHe said the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) and NADMA had also issued early warnings to ensure preparedness at all levels.\nHe also reminded Sabah and Sarawak folks to be vigilant and aware of the current situation following the weather forecast of a significant monsoon surge from Feb 4-7.\n\"This situation has the potential to cause continuous heavy rain in Sabah and Sarawak. As such, warnings of strong winds and rough seas have been issued for the waters of the South China Sea during that period,€ he said.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-02-01",
    "text": "\n The National Security Council (NSC) has expressed support for President Marcos' setting as condition for the pullout of US Typhon launchers China's withdrawal of its claims over Philippine territorial waters.\nIn a statement, National Security Adviser Eduardo Año said the NSC fully supports 'the President's call to the People's Republic of China to respect Philippine sovereign rights and jurisdiction and stop aggressive and coercive behavior in the West Philippine Sea.'\n'We have always pursued peaceful and diplomatic measures consistent with our desire to de-escalate rising tensions in the West Philippine Sea,' Año said.\n'Our actions in the West Philippine Sea remain compliant with international law and established norms of cooperation and diplomacy,' he pointed out.\n'We see this as contributory to peace and stability in the region, which will benefit not only the Philippines but the entire region,' he added.\nHe also stressed that the Typhon missile system in the country which is being protested by China is solely for defense purposes and not directed at any nation.\nHe said the same missile system was deployed in the Philippines during the 2024 Balikatan exercises with the US to improve readiness and interoperability with the armed forces of partner countries, particularly the United States.\n'As such, its continued deployment in the country is essential in our efforts to improve our defense capabilities,' Año pointed out.\n'Nonetheless, the President has made a sincere gesture to the People's Republic of China, which we hope will be reciprocated in the spirit of goodwill and amity among our two great nations,' he said.\n'Provisional understanding'\nIn a related development, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo clarified that the 'provisional understanding' with China that allows unimpeded rotation and resupply missions to the BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal does not compromise the country's sovereign rights in the West Philippine Sea.\n'We did not surrender sovereignty or sovereign rights,' Manalo said in an interview over 'Bagong Pilipinas Ngayon' TV program.\nHe explained that the provisional arrangement covers the Ayungin Shoal alone and that it has led to 'at least three or four missions na walang (without) incident.'\nHe stressed that the provisional understanding does not change the country's position on its sovereign rights.\nIt's being reached through a bilateral consultative mechanism, which has demonstrated that diplomacy can still do wonders to lower tensions in the region.\nManalo noted that the DFA considers the WPS as 'a primary security challenge' and the Philippines maintains its position on the matter based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 Arbitral Award which invalidated China's expansive claims in the South China Sea.\nThe China Coast Guard (CCG), meanwhile, maintains its menacing presence in the country's western coast, with four of its ships monitored sailing near Zambales.\nIn a statement on Thursday, Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesman Jay Tarriela said the BRP Teresa Magbanua was able to push back a bigger CCG vessel with bow number 3304 when the latter attempted to get close to Zambales. The PCG vessel 'successfully pushed CCG 3304 further away from the coast of Zambales, now estimated to be at a distance of 100-105 nautical miles,' Tarriela said.\n'Despite CCG 3304's assertions that it is patrolling within China's maricreated_at jurisdiction and its refusal to recognize the Arbitral Award, the BRP Teresa Magbanua has persistently emphasized that the Chinese vessel lacks legal authority and is, in fact, violating the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the 2016 Arbitral Award,' he said.\nThe three other CCG vessels in the area, according to Tarriela, included the one nicknamed 'monster ship' because of its size.\nThey were the same vessels seen surrounding Panatag Shoal or Bajo de Masinloc early this week.\nTarriela emphasized that the PCG is 'unwavering in its commitment to uphold President Bongbong Marcos' directives, diligently working to prevent CCG from establishing an illegal presence and engaging in coercive actions in the West Philippine Sea, all while ensuring that tensions do not escalate.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-02-01",
    "text": "\nThis week, Chinese technology has shown the West the challenge it faces - ruthless, implacable and impossible to ignore. The unveiling of the Chinese artificial intelligence model DeepSeek has not only disrupted the business models of America's tech behemoths; it has also shown that, in the race to develop the tools for economic hegemony, Beijing is set on supremacy. The launch of DeepSeek came just days before the CIA's conclusion that, on the balance of probabilities, the Covid virus was incubated in a Wuhan lab - a man-made killer, not a product of nature's evolutionary mischief. China stands revealed as a power bent on using science to secure not human flourishing but geopolitical dominance for its Leninist leadership.\n    \nThere is nothing artificial aboutthe intelligence Beijing gainsabout the West from DeepSeek\nDeepSeek is a technological breakthrough of staggering boldness. It processes information at a fraction of the cost of existing AI systems. As one commentator noted, models which have been assumed to need the power of a Ferrari to function have been overtaken by an e-bike. Its ability to perform apparently endless useful functions at high speed and low cost has already led to it becoming the most downloaded app in the US.\nBut DeepSeek is no neutral fact-checker, no autonomous cruncher of data. It is, like every enterprise in China, a weapon in Xi Jinping's armoury. One user who asked about the Uighurs - the Muslim population of the province of Xinjiang who provide Beijing with slave labour - found that DeepSeek is hard-wired to serve regime interests. Just as it started to give an honest answer, referencing the widely reported human rights abuses, the words fluttered from the screen to be replaced with the message: 'Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else.' A similar response greeted an inquiry about the Tiananmen Square massacre. The bot said it could not answer because it was designed 'to provide helpful and harmless responses'.\nThere is nothing harmless about DeepSeek. The speedy and cheap information it brings users is a Shirt of Nessus - a prize that ensnares and weakens those who adopt it. Every keystroke entered, every question asked, every task initiated sees information flow to the ultimate owners of this technology - the Chinese state and the Communist party which runs it. There is nothing artificial about the intelligence Beijing gains about the West from this model.\nChina's understanding that technology offers the means to weaken the West is not new. TikTok has already provided Beijing with a way to mine western citizens' data for its own ends. And while China gathers information, it also creates dislocation. TikTok has, aptly, been described as a weapon of mass distraction, making communication an exercise in simplification, exaggeration and polarisation.\nIt would require an industrial level of naivety not to see the dangers in the nature of Xi's regime. But that is what our government appears to be displaying. A few weeks ago, Rachel Reeves travelled to China - a journey she seems to have made on her knees - imploring Beijing to 'invest' in the UK. She was given £600 million for her trouble. The Democratic Republic of Congo, by way of comparison, has received $3.8 billion worth of investment from China.\nTo secure that 'investment', the British government has had to ignore not just China's theft of British intellectual property, its intimidation of Chinese dissidents here, its repression of the democrats in Hong Kong we once pledged to protect, its re-education camps and use of forced labour in Xinjiang, its menacing of Taiwan and its illegal annexation of territory in the South China Sea, but also its colonisation of territories from Djibouti through Sri Lanka to Mauritius. Mauritius, which the UK government wants to pay upwards of £9 billion to lease our own sovereign territory in the Chagos Islands.\nThe belief that China was a partner whose investment could provide us with the growth every government wants to secure is not, of course, new. It is frightening to remember that until five years ago the UK government was happy to allow Huawei - which, like every enterprise in China, ultimately serves the state - to run our 5G broadband networks. It would have provided a hostile state with an invaluable surveillance window into Britain. It was only warnings that the US would no longer share intelligence with Britain if Chinese kit were embedded in our communications infrastructure that forced a change of mind. China, too, could easily have ended up running our nuclear power stations, with equal risks for security.\nThose mistakes were, at least, corrected. Now, however, when the scale and malevolence of Chinese ambition is clearer than ever, our government whores after their money. It is humiliating.\nXi thrives on western weakness. He follows the Leninist maxim: push in the knife and if you encounter steel, withdraw. If you encounter mush, push on. The present government's policy on China is pure mush. The knife threatens us all.\n       \n"

    "title": "China's Growing Power Alarms US Lawmakers",
    "created_at": "2025-02-01",
    "text": "\n Macomb, Detroit, Michigan- The recent US Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing underscored that China is the most significant long-term threat to US national security. The discussion, led by Senator Marco Rubio, who has been nominated for Secretary of State, emphasized concerns about China's economic, military, and technological ambitions, positioning it as the foremost geopolitical adversary of the UsSA. Lawmakers pointed to China's alleged aggressive global strategies, including intellectual property matters, cyber warfare, military and economic expansion, as evidence of its intent to challenge US dominance.\nBreaking free from a cycle of rivalry and embracing strategic cooperation could yield substantial benefits not just for the USA and China but for the global community as a whole. At this critical juncture, US policymakers must reconsider their approach and explore avenues for constructive engagement. Instead of escalating tensions, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship could pave the way for lasting global stability and prosperity\nThe committee identified four key adversaries- China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran- with China at the forefront, and accused China of involvement in the fentanyl trade, supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, aiding Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East, and reinforcing North Korea's aggressive stance in the Asia-Pacific region.\nA major concern raised was China's increasing control over global supply chains, including critical industries such as rare earth minerals, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. Senators emphasized that China's technological advancements pose a significant risk to US economic and national security interests. They discussed strategies to counter China's dominance by restricting Chinese access to advanced US technologies, reinforcing domestic manufacturing capabilities, and securing key partnerships with allied nations.\nAdditionally, the committee proposed a comprehensive Indo-Pacific strategy to counter China's influence. This included strengthening military alliances with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines, as well as increasing military cooperation through the AUKUS agreement with Australia and the United Kingdom. The senators stressed that US engagements should be aimed at deterring Chinese actions in the South China Sea, where China has allegedly harassed Philippine vessels, conducted large-scale military exercises aimed at Taiwan, and simulated a naval blockade of Japan, stressing on expanding intelligence-sharing mechanisms and facilitating technology transfers among allies to maintain regional stability.\nThe hearing also focused on China's alleged cyberwarfare activities, including recent cyberattacks on US government institutions such as the Treasury Department. Senators detailed China's alleged involvement in sabotaging undersea communication cables in Asia and Europe, highlighting the broader threat posed by Chinese cyberespionage. The committee emphasized the need to strengthen US cybersecurity infrastructure and take proactive measures to neutralize cyberthreats before they escalate.\nRegarding Taiwan, the committee reaffirmed its support for the 'Porcupine Strategy,' aimed at making the cost of invading Taiwan prohibitively high for China. This strategy includes increasing arms sales to Taiwan, fortifying its missile defense systems, and expanding diplomatic backing to counter China's efforts to isolate Taiwan on the global stage. Senator Rubio and his colleagues emphasized that defending Taiwan is not just about regional security but also about maintaining the credibility of US commitments to its allies.\nA significant portion of the hearing was dedicated to human rights concerns, particularly China's alleged repression of ethnic minorities such as the Uighurs. Senator Rubio committed to lobbying against the deportation of Uighur refugees from Thailand back to China, where they reportedly face persecution. The committee also condemned China's use of forced labour and transnational repression, urging stronger global action to address these human rights abuses.\nIn terms of global security, the committee emphasized that the world is currently facing its most dangerous geopolitical climate since World War II and argued that the USA must shift from a defensive to an offensive posture to secure its interests.\nHowever, for anyone watching the hearing live, it was evident that the committee's accusations were largely theoretical, based on perceived and pre-established views. Despite making several allegations, the committee failed to present any irrefutable evidence to substantiate its claims that China was involved in the illegal activities outlined during the hearing.\nThe committee overlooked China's perspective that, while pursuing its legitimate rights and responsibilities toward international peace and prosperity, it adheres strictly to peaceful and lawful means to achieve its objectives without jeopardizing any partner or regional and global stability.\nUnlike other nations, China asserts that it remains uninvolved in regional and international conflicts, including the war in the Middle East, the Israel-Palestine crisis, and the Russia-Ukraine war. Moreover, China emphasizes that it does not threaten other nations with annexation, such as incorporating Canada as the 51st US state, reclaiming control over the Panama Canal, or occupying Greenland, adding that the USA forms alliances at both bilateral and multilateral levels specifically to undermine China's legitimate interests. Whereas, China has extended an open invitation to the USA and other nations to collaborate in its global efforts to enhance the quality of life for people worldwide. c\nThe most questionable assertion of all was on Taiwan given that Taiwan is not a US territory, yet the USA assumes the inherent right to interfere in what is essentially a bilateral territorial dispute between Taiwan and China- one that has no direct connection to the USA. While the USA frequently warns, criticizes, and censures other countries for interfering in bilateral matters of other countries, it continues to reserve the right to intervene in conflicts worldwide as though it were an inherent prerogative.\nThe committee seemed to overlook the USA.'s own controversial human rights record, including the inhumane and degrading treatment of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay, targeted and extrajudicial killings of declared enemies around the globe without judicial review, and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians through military interventions in Afghanistan, the Middle East, Syria, and Libya. Furthermore, the USA. has been accused of supporting Israel's actions in Gaza, which many have condemned as genocidal.\nThe US Senators' perspective once again highlights the double standards of the USA. As of today, the USA is the world's largest exporter of arms and ammunition, which are among the primary drivers of wars, conflicts, and unrest worldwide. Additionally, the USA maintains 257 military bases across the globe, whereas China has only one. Despite this, the USA assumes the authority to unilaterally determine the legitimacy of other nations' economic and geopolitical pursuits while exempting itself from such scrutiny.\nDespite the urgency with which the USA has framed China as a strategic competitor, the broader implications of such an adversarial approach warrant critical reflection. While policymakers in Washington now acknowledge the scale of China's global ascendancy, their recognition comes at a point where China's dominance over rare earth metals, control of global supply chains, and economic expansion have reached an almost irreversible status.\nInstead of merely labeling China as an adversary, the USA should consider an alternative strategy- one that moves beyond confrontation toward collaboration. Engaging China as a preferred partner rather than an existential threat could pave the way for more constructive diplomacy, where both nations focus their vast economic, technological, and geopolitical resources on addressing global challenges.\nBreaking free from a cycle of rivalry and embracing strategic cooperation could yield substantial benefits not just for the USA and China but for the global community as a whole. At this critical juncture, US policymakers must reconsider their approach and explore avenues for constructive engagement. Instead of escalating tensions, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship could pave the way for lasting global stability and prosperity.\n"

They say a measured approach is needed to ensure fair investigations while preventing unnecessary paranoia. \nOfficials announced on Thursday that five Chinese nationals had been arrested in Palawan for allegedly conducting surveillance on a Philippine Coast Guard ship near the Spratly Islands. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nAuthorities said the suspects, who posed as Taiwanese tourists, installed high-resolution, solar-powered cameras at a seaside resort to monitor coastguard and navy movements. Residents reportedly saw them recording military activity. \nThe arrests follow the January 17 capture of Chinese national Deng Yuanqing and two Filipino associates in Makati, who were accused of spying on military and police facilities. Investigators have since linked the five new suspects to Deng. \nLucio Pitlo III, a geopolitical analyst and president of the Philippine Association for Chinese Studies, told This Week in Asia that while authorities should not downplay espionage cases, \"we should avoid sensationalising them\". \n\"This will insulate the investigation from public opinion or politics, letting law enforcement and security officers conduct thorough, impartial, and credible probes,\" he said, adding that it would also prevent hurting the country's tourism industry. \nPitlo said China's resumption of more direct flights to the Philippines after last year's closure of offshore gaming operators, or Pogos, could encourage more visitors to return. \n\"But sensational handling of these alleged spy cases may dissuade them from coming. The last thing an innocent tourist wants to have is to spend a holiday vacation in some interrogation room or prison,\" he said. \nChinese-Filipino civic leader Teresita Ang See has spoken out against Deng's arrest and called on Filipino authorities to conduct a fair probe after Deng's Filipino wife refuted claims that her husband had been engaged in gathering intelligence for Beijing. \nAng See is the co-founder of Kaisa Para sa Kaunlaran, a socio-civic organisation that has advocated for the participation of local ethnic Chinese in national development in the Philippines. \nAng See said in a statement on January 25 that Deng's wife and sister had sought her help to clear his name, and called on Philippine authorities to engage experts to determine the nature of the equipment Deng used so that the misunderstanding could be cleared up. \nDeng's wife, Noemi, also said at a press conference earlier this week that her husband had been in the Philippines for 10 years and frequently travelled in and out of the country. \n\"We have an eight-year-old child. I am worried about what will happen to our child at school because of reports in the media that claim he is a spy,\" she said. \nAuthorities initially alleged that there were possible efforts by a \"foreign power\" to map out the country, after they found Deng and his associates in possession of data-gathering devices capable of sending sensitive information such as exact coordinates and topographic details that could be used for military targeting or drone operations. \nAng-See lambasted the \"trial by publicity\" and called it a big jump to an \"iffy conclusion that China is spying on the Philippines just because a technician has road surveying instruments in his car\". \nNo one had been allowed to see Deng since his arrest, \"which worsens fears that Deng has been harmed\", she said, adding that consular visits by the Chinese embassy in Manila were also denied. \nObservers said Ang See's concerns about the probe surrounding Deng were warranted amid rising tensions between the Philippines and China. \n\"What [Ang See] did [ ...] was to cast doubt on the accusations because there was the sense that the apprehending authorities did not immediately recognise the nature of the equipment they encountered, while something might have been lost in translation between Deng and the apprehending authorities, which led them to what might be a false alarm,\" Reynard Hing, president of Kaisa Para sa Kaunlaran, told This Week in Asia. \nHing said the government could be acting in a \"heightened state of paranoia because of the constant stream of news about Chinese incursions into the Philippine exclusive economic zone\". \nEnrico Gloria, an assistant professor of political science at the University of the Philippines and a doctoral student at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said he believed Ang See spoke out \"because the government hasn't really built its case that Deng is a spy\". \n\"The government must produce credible evidence that points to Deng being a spy. The crucial element here is evidence linking his connection with the Chinese government. If they cannot produce that crucial information, then doubts are warranted,\" he told This Week in Asia. \nPitlo said publicising the arrests \"seem to be in line with Manila's transparency approach\" in dealing with China's incursions in the South China Sea. \nHowever, he warned that trial by publicity \"carries its own risk, not least alerting other actors who may have similar designs\". \n\"The matter further strains already worn ties between Manila and Beijing,\" he added. \nIn March 2024, a survey by local polling firm OCTA Research showed that 91 per cent of Filipinos said they did not trust China. \nObservers fear the geopolitical tensions between the Philippines and China have fanned the flames of suspicion and bias against the Chinese-Filipino community, known locally as Tsinoys. \n\"One student [of Chinese-Filipino ancestry] shared that a professor would jokingly call her Alice Guo,\" Gloria said, referring to the infamous former mayor of Bamban town who has been linked to transnational crime organisations and accused of being a Chinese spy. \nSome political figures have also questioned Chinese-Filipinos' loyalty to the Philippines, notably Congressman Robert Ace Barbers who last year demanded that ethnic Chinese business leaders condemn Pogo-linked crimes. \nObservers described such loyalty checks as both discriminatory and unnecessary. \nPitlo pointed out that many prominent Filipinos of Chinese descent had made \"indelible contributions\" to national development, and that Tsinoys were not a homogenous group. \n\"Instead of looking for scapegoats or giving in to jingoism, wise leaders should find better ways to tap this community to serve as a bridge to promote mutual understanding, alternative interlocutors to ease tensions and channels to secure more gainful deals from China,\" he said. \nJan Robert Go, an associate professor of political science at the University of the Philippines, said such loyalty tests had no room in the Philippines' multiethnic and diverse society. \n\"Instead of these accusations, politicians and individuals should focus on harnessing support from different groups, including the Chinese-Filipino community, to bolster the country's position amid these tensions,\" he said. \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "text": "\n The Philippines should brace for the worst and expect more intense espionage activities by Chinese spies amid an escalating conflict with China over the West Philippine Sea, Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian warned yesterday.\nIn an interview with radio dwIZ, Gatchalian said it was no longer surprising that Chinese sleeper agents were arrested by authorities at a created_at when the Philippines was upping the ante in asserting its sovereign rights in the South China Sea and defying the bullying and hostile acts of China Coast Guard vessels in the country's territorial waters.\nHe echoed the concern of President Marcos, who said he was 'very disturbed' about the reported arrests by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) of six suspected Chinese sleeper agents.\nDeng Yuanqing and his two Filipino cohorts were arrested on Jan. 17 in Makati in possession of alleged espionage equipment for mapping and transmitting data on military camps and infrastructure.\nDeng's accomplices - Cai Shaohuang, Wang Yong Yi, Wu Chin Ren, Wu Cheng Ting and Cheng Hai Tao - were arrested days later on charges of gathering information on the rotation and resupply missions of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) in Palawan, where they allegedly set up surveillance cameras and posed as tourists to map naval detachments and coast guard stations.\n'This is alarming. Chinese spies have been doing this in our country for quite some created_at, complete with equipment for their operations here. This is something we should expect. Let's be prepared,' Gatchalian said.\nHe commended the NBI for its successful operations against the suspected spies, but added that Philippine law enforcers should expand their intelligence network.\n'I commend the NBI for catching the spies in the act, but we should widen further our intelligence capability. I really think there are more spies out there,' the senator said.\nThe Senate uncovered extensive Chinese espionage, infiltration and propaganda activities during its investigation on the now banned Philippine offshore gaming operator (POGO) hubs, which served as fronts of syndicates for criminal operations, particularly human trafficking.\nDuring the POGO hearings, National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) deputy director general Francisco Acedillo said the Chinese spy network has long been entrenched in the economic and political landscape of the Philippines.\nThe most high-profile official accused of being a spy is dismissed mayor Alice Guo, tagged as having links to the raided Bamban, Tarlac POGO hub and accused of being a communist spy by gambling tycoon and self-confessed agent She Zhijiang.\nAcedillo said Guo is an 'agent of influence' who used her position for the benefit of China.\nGatchalian, who was active in the Senate POGO investigations, said Chinese spies slipped past authorities when they pretended to work for POGOs, which proliferated during the previous administration.\n'Now that POGOs are banned, the entry of spies can also be prevented, and foreign agents will find a more difficult created_at to get in and threaten our national security,' Gatchalian said.\nBureau of Immigration (BI) Commissioner Joel Anthony Viado said the arrested Chinese spies have 'regular immigration statuses in the Philippines.' He said this 'added to the suspicion that they have embedded themselves in society.'\nWhile he did not specifically identify the 'foreign nationals' as Chinese, Viado said they were those recently arrested by the NBI and the Armed Forces of the Philippines.\nViado said the BI would 'work closely with the NBI to determine if there are individuals who assisted the suspects in their supposed illegal activities.'\n'Should we confirm that there are individuals - whether Filipinos or foreign nationals - that hid or assisted these alleged spies, we will file cases against them for harboring illegal aliens, in violation of section 46 of the Philippine immigration act of 1940,' he said. \n"

    "text": "\nManila, Feb. 2 -- FOR MONDAY\nAmid deteriorating relations with China, the Philippines, under the current Trump 2.0 administration, may increasingly become a \"friendshoring\" partner for the US, its former colonizer, especially in the technology sector, according to researchers at the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\"Due to shifting geopolitical dynamics with the People's Republic of China, the Philippines is exploring new energy, tourism, and infrastructure projects, presenting a potential opportunity to strengthen friendshoring initiatives with the United States,\" noted William Alan Reinsch, Scholl Chair in International Business at the Washington-based CSIS, and Scholl Chair intern Reena Samuel in a Jan. 31 blog.\nThe Switzerland-based World Economic Forum (WEF) defines friendshoring as \"rerouting of supply chains to countries perceived as politically and economically safe or low-risk, to avoid disruption to the flow of business.\nIn 2023, WEF noted that friendshoring has been \"a growing trade practice where supply chain networks are focused on countries regarded as political and economic allies.\"\nReinsch and Samuel's blog, titled \"Rocking the Boat: The Philippines Trade Strategy Amid Rising Geoeconomic Tensions\" said the Philippines has \"also taken strategic steps to strengthen its economic pathways with other nations, signifying a slowdown in their relationship with China\"-its biggest trading partner.\nFor instance, the CSIS blog recalled that when Chinese vessels rammed a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) ship and supply boat at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal -- known locally as Ayungin Shoal-back in 2023, Transportation Secretary Jaime J. Bautista subsequently announced that the Philippines had stopped securing funding from China for three big-ticket infrastructure projects under the Marcos Jr. administration's Build Better More program.\n\"Bautista [had] emphasized that the collision did not influence his decision-rather, China's delays prompted the Philippines to call on Japan, South Korea, the United States, and the European Union for 'better' deals\" in infrastructure, unlike the Chinese loan commitments secured during the previous Duterte administration, the blog noted.\nIn a Jan. 31 interview, US President Donald J. Trump's Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: \"You see it in the Indo-Pacific where every day-it's not just Taiwan; it's the Philippines-are being aggressively challenged by the Chinese militarily.\"\nFor CSIS, \"in assessing how to best engage Southeast Asia economically, the Trump administration will need to consider how the regional powers' economic and security standing has evolved vis-a-vis the United States and China.\"\nIn the case of the Philippines, CSIS pointed to the last four years-thanks to closer ties between Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden-wherein Manila \"continues to be a key piece of a successful approach for Washington.\"\nAs such, CSIS urged leveraging the stronger economic as well as military relations between the Philippines and the US since last year, amid China's more aggressive stance in South China Sea's disputed territories.\nAccording to the CSIS blog, the Philippines and the US can potentially become friendshoring partners in high-tech.\n\"The Philippines enjoys a comparative advantage in the technology sector. The Philippine semiconductor market, which has benefited greatly from the global uptick in semiconductor demand, is transitioning into more specialized areas, such as integrated circuit design and fabrication. Its semiconductor industry is expected to grow 10 to 15 percent annually until at least 2027,\" the blog pointed out.\n\"Under the Chips and Science Act's International Technology, Security, and Innovation Fund, the United States designated the Philippines as a partner-country to incentivize the Philippine semiconductor industry to become more conducive for US investors by funding initiatives such as training 128,000 semiconductor engineers and technicians by 2028. The Philippines has been increasing its high-technology exports since the early 2010s, with the top products being integrated circuits, office machine parts, gold, semiconductor devices, and insulated wire,\" it added.\nIt helps that the Philippines economy is expected to be among Southeast Asia's top performers, estimated by the Washington-based multilateral lender International Monetary Fund (IMF) to expand by 6.1 percent this year, the blog noted.\nReal gross domestic product (GDP) grew by a below-target 5.6 percent in 2024, no thanks to the damage wrought by a string of strong typhoons towards the end of last year, although it was still among the fastest expansions in the region.\nHowever, CSIS pointed to lingering energy and infrastructure gaps that must be addressed to maximize the Philippines' potential as a US friendshoring ally.\n\"To build international credibility as an attractive trading partner, the Philippines needs to develop reliable energy sources and invest in infrastructure to facilitate growth in sectors that require 24/7 connectivity,\" it explained.\nIn particular, CSIS is optimistic about recent moves by the Marcos Jr. government to revive the mothballed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant as part of its plan to incorporate nuclear energy in the country's power grid by 2032, with the help of the US, Japanese, and South Korean governments.\n\"The steps the Philippines has taken to elevate its economic standing through partnerships with other countries will likely make the country more attractive to foreign direct investment and may lessen its trade dependence on China,\" according to the CSIS blog.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

    "text": "\n In March 2017, China's People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) achieved a significant milestone when its fifth generation jet, the Chengdu J-20 Mighty Dragon stealth aircraft, entered into service. As the world's first operational stealth aircraft operationalised outside the USA, this development marked the end of the USA's monopoly on military aviation. Now only seven years down the lane, China made an even bigger bang, when video footage surfaced of a new aircraft, speculated to be sixth-generation, flying over Chengdu, China.\nThough the Chinese authorities have not yet officially confirmed the jet's existence or given it a name, the development has spurred a renewed debate around the world over what constitutes a sixth-generation fighter aircraft, China's strategic motivation, its impact on China's global power projection, and broader implications for global military aviation.\nTo completely comprehend the notion of sixth-generation fighter jets, it is significant to trace the evolution of aircraft over generations. The voyage began with the first-generation piston-engine fighters and continued to the second generation, which saw the introduction of guided missiles. The third generation witnessed the arrival of Beyond Visual Range (BVR) engagements, while the fourth generation introduced multi-role capability, as demonstrated by aircraft such as the F-16. Subsequently, fifth-generation aircraft laid the foundation for the next major advancement with their stealth technology, advanced sensor and communication systems, and super cruise capabilities through F-22 Raptor, F-35 Lightning II, J-20, J-35, and Su-57.\nThe sixth-generation aircraft is speculated to transcend the fifth-generation combat aircraft in terms of stealth capability. China is already pushing the boundaries of stealth technology in its much-discussed sixth-generation fighter jet. There is widespread speculation that the concerned aircraft is likely to have stealth materials that will be thin and lightweight and will be able to absorb both high-frequency electromagnetic waves from advanced military radars and low-frequency detection signals used by anti-stealth radars.\nThe sixth-generation aircraft are also touted as digital aircraft since they integrate control capabilities with artificial intelligence (AI) that will enable these fighters to conduct more autonomous missions, make decisions in real created_at on the battlefield, and immediately analyse volumes of data.\nMoreover, the probable integration of certain directed energy weapons (DEWs), like powerful microwaves or laser systems, is another novel feature. It is anticipated that these fighter jets will also feature an unmatched network integration becoming a part of a seamlessly integrated combat system that includes other aircraft, drones, ground stations, and satellite networks to make it effective for joint military operations. In addition, this sixth generation aircraft is also believed to have an advanced radar system capable of detecting and engaging threats at greater distance which will provide the pilots a crucial advantage in modern air battles.\nKeeping aside AMCA, India is currently struggling to induct even improved variants of its fourth-generation Tejas Mk1A and the so-called 4.5 generation MK2 fighters owing to persistent delays in procurement and dependence on foreign-built engines. In sum, this technological lag will place India in a precarious position and will weaken its stance in the region owing to the fact that it would have to deal now with fifth-gen fighters from the two sides of its border that will soon be complemented by a sixth generation fighter as well.\nConsidering the aforementioned points, it can be argued that the development will have significant implications for military aviation around the world. With the fifth-generation jets, the USA and its allies have dominated the skies for a long created_at. However, China's new inroads into sixth-generation technology have now sent a powerful message to its competitors, particularly the USA, that China is not only trying to close the gap aggressively but is also deeply committed to shaping the future of military aviation and air combat with its advanced and diverse fleet.\nConsequently, this advancement could spark a renewed arms race between China and the Western countries. Reports are already doing rounds that suggest that Western nations are likely to accelerate their sixth-generation aircraft programmes, including the USA's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) and Europe's Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), a collaborative initiative of the UK, Italy, and Japan.\nFrom a geopolitical and strategic point of view, in the wake of a sixth-generation combat aircraft, China's position is likely to be strengthened. It will enable China to leverage its cutting-edge air warfare technologies, particularly in disputed regions such as the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and other areas of its interest. In addition, it will enable China to conduct missions to potentially deny adversaries' forces operational capabilities. Consequently, it can prompt the countries, trying to impose themselves on the region, namely the USA, to reassess their defence strategies.\nAs India is trying to play the role of an offshore balancer and net security provider on behalf of the United States against China in the South Asian region, one might naturally ask how will this development impact it in the region? Like writing on the wall, it is quite obvious that the induction of sixth-generation combat aircraft by China will be no less than a nightmare for India. While China races ahead with sixth-generation fighter development, India is still grappling with the challenge of countering fifth-generation combat aircraft not only from China but also from Pakistan, which is set to acquire the Chinese fifth-generation J-35 fighters by 2026.\nIndia's much-touted first fifth-generation stealth fighter project Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), is still a dream which is years away from producing even a flying prototype, let alone its eventual induction into the Indian Air Force (IAF), which according to many experts is at least a decade away.\nKeeping aside AMCA, India is currently struggling to induct even improved variants of its fourth-generation Tejas Mk1A and the so-called 4.5 generation MK2 fighters owing to persistent delays in procurement and dependence on foreign-built engines. In sum, this technological lag will place India in a precarious position and will weaken its stance in the region owing to the fact that it would have to deal now with fifth-gen fighters from the two sides of its border that will soon be complemented by a sixth generation fighter as well.\n"
