Romualdez on Wednesday (Switzerland created_at) reaffirmed the Philippines' unwavering stance on its territorial integrity as he expressed strong support for President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.'s firm policy on safeguarding Philippine sovereignty.\n\"President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. has been very, very firm on his policy that we should not give an inch of any Philippine territory,\" Speaker Romualdez said, speaking as a panelist during the Stakeholder Dialogue entitled \"Navigating Asia's Hotspots\" at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2025 in Davos, Switzerland.\n\"Having that been said, we celebrate, of course, our rules-based global order, and with the UNCLOS and the 2016 arbitral award recognizing the sovereignty of the Philippines, we stand steadfast with the President's policy in enforcing that,\" he added.\nHe was joined in the panel by Timor-Leste President Jose Ramos Horta, Indonesia's Foreign Minister Sugiono; Michael Froman, President of the Council on Foreign Relations; and Tulsi Naidu, Chief Executive Officer of Asia-Pacific, Zurich Insurance Group.\nHowever, Speaker Romualdez emphasized that the Philippines, under President Marcos Jr., has adopted a pragmatic and balanced approach to navigating the intensifying geopolitical competition between the United States and China, particularly in relation to the South China Sea issue.\nBalancing Geopolitical Interests\nDuring the panel, Speaker Romualdez underscored the Philippines' strategic position as an ally of the United States and a vital trade partner of China. He advocated for leveraging both relationships to advance the country's national interests.\nHe emphasized that the territorial dispute in South China Sea does not define the entirety of the Philippines' relationship with China.\n\"Despite the President being very firm on this policy of not giving up a single inch, we are working daily to de-escalate tensions. We do not want the South China Sea dispute to overshadow the many other facets of our relationship with China, including trade, education, and cultural exchanges,\" Romualdez said.\n\"We are not taking sides. The United States is our long-standing ally, and China is our largest trading partner. The Philippines is navigating a middle path where we maximize opportunities from both relationships while actively participating in the broader global community,\" he said.\nOn U.S. partnerships, Speaker Romualdez welcomed recent reassurances from new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the Mutual Defense Treaty and Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, noting their alignment with the Philippines' strategic priorities.\nReports said that in a call with his Philippine counterpart Enrique Manalo, Rubio \"underscored the United States' ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defense Treaty.\"\n\"Our enduring alliance with the United States strengthens our ability to safeguard sovereignty and pursue peace. At the same created_at, we remain proactive in fostering relationships with all nations to promote global collaboration,\" he said.\nEconomic Growth and Global Engagement\nSpeaker Romualdez highlighted the economic benefits of the Philippines' pragmatic foreign policy, noting its attractiveness to investors due to its robust GDP growth, youthful workforce and strategic location within ASEAN.\n\"We are here at the WEF to tell the Philippine story--of a nation full of potential and resilience. As part of ASEAN, we are at the heart of a dynamic growth region, and we are working to build stronger partnerships to unlock opportunities for trade and investment,\" he said.\nCiting engagements with industrial leaders from India as an example, Speaker Romualdez emphasized how the Indo-Pacific region, including the Philippines, is emerging as a key hub for global trade.\nCommitment to Peace and Cooperation\nReiterating the Philippines' role in fostering regional stability, Speaker Romualdez affirmed the nation's dedication to ASEAN centrality and multilateralism.\n\"ASEAN continues to play a vital role in ensuring regional peace and stability. The Philippines remains committed to this multilateral framework, which has proven effective in addressing challenges while promoting cooperation,\" he said.\nSpeaker Romualdez emphasized the Philippines' commitment to a balanced and pragmatic foreign policy, rooted in upholding sovereignty, fostering economic growth, and pursuing peaceful international collaboration.\n\"Our future lies in de-escalating tensions, building meaningful partnerships, and safeguarding our principles.

        "text": "\nIN getting down to business at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim came equipped with Malaysia's continuing pragmatism of non-alignment amidst increasingly treacherous geopolitical conflicts. Like all prime ministers before him, Anwar has cogently maintained the bedrock of Malaysia's diplomatic position: not being drawn into siding with one major superpower against another.\nIt's complicated. Malaysia's outright denunciation of Israel's unrelenting assault and genocide of Palestinians incurs the displeasure of the Americans, only because of its over-pampering of the lethal Zionist state. However, it doesn't mean that relations with the United States is tanking. Far from it. Malaysia still benefits from American foreign investments in decades of advanced computer chip production. Malaysia is also influenced by American soft power: its socio-political philosophy, media diet, Internet technology, literature, cuisine, entertainment and people-to-people interaction. In return, the US lives with Malaysia's foreign policy, though it hankers for a tougher stance against China akin to its own hostile position. Nothing doing. If Malaysia is friendly with America, we are just as friendly with China, given the historical links from the Middle Ages to current Chinese trade, tourism, infrastructural presence and socio-cultural affection.\nIn adopting this fine balance, Malaysia carefully stays clear of this belligerent contest, from threats of higher tariffs to TikTok's on-and-off ban, and flirtations with actual war in the South China Sea. The US and China are comfortable with Malaysia's neutrality, a recognition of our crucial and credible regional diplomatic activism as a founding member of Asean. Still, the often contradictory narratives shaped by the US-China's geopolitical tussle have often pushed many strategic countries, like Malaysia, to play a zero-sum game, which Anwar has dismissed. It's a high-powered tightrope fielding this duelling rhetoric. The US once projected itself as a mighty military nation defending liberalism, rules and norms. But lately, under the nihilistic tendencies of its new president, these cherished values are being scorched. If America commits to the \"yin\", the Chinese \"yang\" emphasises common interests, harmony and shared destiny, even if the Chinese military flexing in the South China Sea disturbs neighbouring nations.\nMalaysia accepts these battlefront narratives as complementary. What it won't accept is one side trouncing the other to reach hegemonic heights in the Asia-Pacific. To be sure, Malaysia's diplomatic conundrum is similar to other countries in the difficulties distinguishing between friends, allies, rivals and enemies. In dealing with America and China, Malaysia relies on a historic rule of thumb: America, despite its lofty global ideals, has waged constant wars, invasions and meddling since its 18th century inception. And the Yankees dropped two unnecessary but genocidal atomic bombs, the only nation to kill with a weapon of mass destruction. China, despite its militaristic overtures, went the opposite, investing in and buying up foreign lands in its Belt and Road Initiative to develop more enthusiastic â€” and uneasy friends.\n( END )\n"

        "created_at": "2025-01-25",
        "text": "\nSpain will participate for the first created_at in a European military deployment in the Indo-Pacific. The frigate F-104 Méndez Núñez will join the battle group led by the British aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales, according to military sources. The Navy is already finalizing a deployment that will last five months, from April to September of this year.\nThe Méndez Núñez will participate in the first three phases of Operation Highmast, which will involve military units from up to 12 countries. The Spanish frigate will join the British carrier battle group on April 22 in the port of Portsmouth (United Kingdom) and will escort it until July 28, in Darwin (Australia), according to Navy sources. The frigate F-105 Cristóbal Colón was already in Australia in 2017, but then it was to instruct Australian sailors and support the sale of ships from the public shipyard Navantia.\nThe new deployment responds to the purpose of European countries to have a greater military presence in the Indo-Pacific, one of the hottest regions of the globe, with several disputes that threaten world peace, such as Beijing's claim to sovereignty over Taiwan or the dispute over the jurisdiction of the waters and islets of the South China Sea. Given the realization that the United States has shifted its strategic interest from the Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific, European countries are increasing their military effort in the area so as not to lose weight to their main ally. A French combat group led by the aircraft carrier Charles De Gaulle is in Southeast Asia and in mid-month carried out exercises in the Strait of Malacca, between Indonesia and Malaysia, while its Italian counterpart Cavour visited Japan last August as part of its first deployment in the region. Spain is studying the possibility of sending its flagship, the Juan Carlos I, to the Indo-Pacific in 2026 or 2027, although there is still no final decision.\nAt a minimum, the Battle Group led by HMS Prince of Wales will consist, in addition to the British aircraft carrier with its complement of fifth-generation F-35 fighter aircraft, of a supply ship, a nuclear attack submarine, several escort ships, such as frigates and destroyers, and the support of early warning and maricreated_at patrol aircraft operating from shore.\nThe objective of Operation Highmast, according to the organization, is to carry out a \"global deployment\", aimed at neutralizing a generic threat; without identifying any specific enemy. The document Visión Armada 2050, which analyzes the missions and needs of the Spanish Navy for the coming decades, presented last December, stresses that \"the world's economic center of gravity is shifting towards the Indo-Pacific, where the sea will gain relevance and it will be necessary to act within the framework of international coalitions\". For its part, the Maricreated_at Security Strategy 2024, approved by the National Security Council in March last year, includes the Indo-Pacific basin among the \"maricreated_at spaces of interest\" for Spain. \"The increase in strategic competition at the global level between great powers is already visibly manifested in geographical scenarios such as the Eastern Mediterranean, the Indo-Pacific or the South China Sea,\" it explains. Military sources admit that Washington's strategic priority is not in Ukraine, but in China, and add that the allies are fully aware of this and know that they must move if they do not want to end up irrelevant.\nThe Méndez Núñez, in service since 2006, is the fourth frigate of the F-100 series, the Navy's most modern, has a crew of 230 and is equipped with the Aegis combat system. It is not yet known which return route it will take from the created_at it leaves the European battle group in Australia until it arrives at its base in Ferrol in mid-September, but Navy sources assure that the design of the voyage is being carried out in accordance with Spanish strategic and commercial interests.\nThis is not the first deployment of the Spanish Armed Forces in the Indo-Pacific. Last year, four Eurofighter fighter planes and two A400M transport planes, with a detachment of 200 military personnel, passed through India, Japan and Australia as part of the Pacific Skies exercise, which took them around the world. This year it will be the Navy that will sail to the Antipodes.\n"

Beijing twice sanctioned him in 2020. \nThe first instance came in retaliation for US measures against senior Chinese officials over the treatment of ethnic minority Uygurs. The second was after mainland and Hong Kong officials were sanctioned following the 2019 protests in Hong Kong. \nWhile the recent phone calls carried signals of intent to continue bilateral engagement, a more hawkish message emerged from Capitol Hill on Friday. \nLawmakers in the US House announced they would reintroduce a bill that would require Trump to review whether Hong Kong officials should be sanctioned for human rights violations. \nAmerican lawmakers have long sought to punish authorities they deem responsible for a crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. \nAmong the dozens named in the bill sponsored by California Republican Young Kim are Hong Kong Justice Secretary Paul Lam Ting-kwok, Commissioner of Police Raymond Siu Chak-yee and judges Andrew Chan Hing-wai, Johnny Chan Jong-herng, Andrew Cheung Kui-nung, Alex Lee Wan-tang, Esther Toh Lye-ping and Amanda Woodcock. \nJim McGovern of Massachusetts, the bill's Democratic co-sponsor, was sanctioned by Beijing last year for \"frequently interfering\" in China's domestic affairs. \nAdditional reporting by Bochen Han in Washington\nCopyright (c) 2025.

        "text": "\nTensions in the West Philippine Sea escalated as Chinese maricreated_at forces allegedly harassed Philippine government vessels conducting a scientific survey near Sandy Cay, according to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).\nOn January 24, Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) vessels BRP Datu Pagbuaya and BRP Datu Bankaw, tasked with a marine scientific survey and sand sampling, faced aggressive actions from multiple Chinese Coast Guard ships and a Chinese Navy helicopter.\nThe BFAR vessels were intercepted by three Chinese Coast Guard shipsidentified as 4106, 5103, and 4202that executed dangerous maneuvers to block their path. Four smaller Chinese Coast Guard boats also targeted BFARs rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBs), which were transporting personnel.\nManila claimed the situation escalated further when a Peoples Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) helicopter, identified by tail number 24, hovered at a dangerously low altitude over the RHIBs. The propeller wash created hazardous turbulence, significantly increasing the risk of accidents.\nCommodore Jay Tarriela, the PCGs spokesperson, described the incident as a blatant disregard for the 1972 Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs).\nThe skilled seamanship of the BFAR crew prevented what could have been catastrophic accidents during these confrontations, Tarriela said.\nThe aggressive actions forced BFAR and PCG to suspend their survey operations, abandoning plans to collect sand samples from Sandy Cay. Tarriela expressed regret over the halted mission but reaffirmed the agencies commitment to safeguarding Philippine maricreated_at interests despite increasing risks.\nSandy Cay, located within the Philippines exclusive economic zone (EEZ), has been a focal point in ongoing maricreated_at disputes with China. In 2023, crushed and dead corals were discovered in Sandy Cay 2, which experts linked to activities preceding potential reclamation projects. Previous incidents included injuries to Filipino researchers when a Chinese Navy helicopter flew dangerously low, scattering debris.\nEnvironmental studies highlight Sandy Cays degraded condition, with low biodiversity and declining fish populations. Dr. Jonathan Anticamara from the University of the Philippines attributed this to overfishing, climate change, and human construction.\nChinas extensive claims in the South China Sea, overlapping with the EEZs of several Southeast Asian nations, continue to fuel regional tensions. The latest incident underscores Beijings disregard for the 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that invalidated its sweeping claims.\nThe West Philippine Sea is a critical global trade route, valued at over $3 trillion annually, making stability in the region a matter of international importance.\nMeanwhile, China has not commented on the Philippines latest allegations. On Friday, the China Coast Guard claimed that the Philippines dispatched a civilian vessel to resupply the grounded BRP Sierra Madre at Ren'ai Jiao after obtaining Chinese approval. China Coast Guard spokesperson Liu Dejun urged the Philippines to honor its commitments and cooperate with Beijing to maintain stability in the area. The BRP Sierra Madre, grounded in 1999, remains at Ren'ai Jiao despite the Philippines longstanding promise to remove it.\n"

        "text": "\nWhat does it matter that Trump wants to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America? Some would say nothing. Words come and go, they have no effect on reality. Let Trump say whatever he wants! None of that affects us concretely. Moreover, we should take it with humor, as President Sheinbaum did in one of her mornings, in which she showed an old map in which the name of Mexican America appeared or as Hillary Clinton did during Trump's inauguration ceremony, in which she could not help but let out a laugh when the president insisted again on the subject.\nIt seems to me that we should not take lightly the issue of the name of that region of the planet. Just as the territorial domain has taken on a relevance that was supposedly lost -consider Trump's bid for the occupation of Greenland- the maricreated_at domain has also acquired an importance that cannot be ignored -think of the naval tensions in what some call the South China Sea and others would prefer it to have another name, precisely to undermine the legitimacy of the Asian power's claim to dominate that enormous maricreated_at extension that encompasses the coasts of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan-. It is no coincidence, therefore, that Trump's proposal to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico is made at the same created_at as his claim to U.S. control of the Panama Canal. It is the same thing: a redefinition of the maricreated_at borders of the United States in view of its national security in the 21st century.\nAlthough the Gulf of Mexico has borne that name for centuries, Mexico has never had naval control of that sea, not even of its coastal zone. During the viceroyalty, pirates ravaged its coasts. Later, when Mexico became independent, it did not have control of the region either. Suffice it to recall the humiliating ease with which foreign powers exercised blockades of Mexican ports in the Gulf, as happened during the war with the United States in 1847, the French intervention in 1862 and the U.S. occupation of Veracruz in 1914.\nBehind the change of name of the Gulf of Mexico is Trump's intention that this sea be controlled by the United States as a buffer to protect its coasts against any foreign threat, but, surely, also to appropriate and exploit all the natural wealth within its waters and on its seabed.\nI would not be surprised if the next step in Trump's strategy is to reclaim Baja California. During World War II, the United States wanted to install naval bases in the Baja California bays to protect its coast from possible incursions by Japanese submarines. The logic would be the same as the one behind the Gulf of Mexico and the Panama Canal.\nThe United States, China and Russia are moving their pieces on the chessboard of the planet. As if placing pawns on empty squares, the powers are preparing for what appears to be an inevitable global showdown. What we are seeing are the territorial preparations for World War III. For the same reason, we should not be surprised that the United States has declared the Mexican cartels as terrorist groups and, therefore, has arrogated to itself the right to intervene militarily in our country. In the event of a global conflict, the United States must be able to close its borders and have an immediate response capacity to any threat that arises in the vicinity of its territory.\nMexico already experienced something similar during World War II. To tell the truth, we did not fare so badly on that occasion. The country was part of the military alliance against fascism, but was able to protect its sovereignty in a way that is admirable. We owe much to the gallantry and good judgment of President Manuel Avila Camacho, who proved to be one of the great statesmen in Mexico's history. President Sheinbaum would do well to take him as a role model.\n"
