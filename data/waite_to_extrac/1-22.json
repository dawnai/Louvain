    "text": "\nChina's People's Liberation Army has conducted sea and air combat readiness drills in the South China Sea as the Philippines and its ally the United States held joint exercises in disputed waters in the region, the PLA Southern Theater Command said.\nThe Chinese joint air-and-sea patrols were held on Jan. 17-18 - just one day after a China-Philippines bilateral consultation meeting - to maintain peace and stability in the area, the command said in a statement.\nAny military activity that stirs up trouble in the South China Sea is within our control, the Chinese command said.\nIt did not specify the exact location of the PLA drills, but on Friday the Philippine navy held a so-called sovereignty patrol with a live-fire exercise near Scarborough Shoal, followed by joint maricreated_at activities with the U.S. Navy on Friday and Saturday.\nScarborough Shoal is a hotly disputed chain of reefs inside the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, but China holds de-facto control and has deployed its large coast guard vessels to the area to exert power since the beginning of the year.\nThe Philippine frigate BRP Antonio Luna and patrol vessels BRP Ramon Alcaraz and BRP Andres Bonifacio took part in the sovereignty patrol, Manila said, adding that it was aimed at sustaining and improving the operational proficiency of both assets and personnel.\nFirst joint drills in 2025\nThe guided-missile frigate BRP Antonio Luna also participated in the two-day joint exercise with the U.S. Navy, the U.S. 7th Fleet, which operates in the region, said in a press release.\nThe first bilateral Maricreated_at Cooperative Activity of the year is designed to emphasize our longstanding partnership between the two militaries in the maricreated_at domain, it said.\nThe show of force included the U.S. Navy Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group and a U.S. Navy P-8A maricreated_at patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, alongside Philippine patrol vessel BRP Andr\\xE9s Bonifacio and the BRP Antonio Luna.\nThe Philippine Navy also deployed two FA-50 fighters to take part in the exercise.\nThe U.S. and the Philippines are ironclad allies, Rear Adm. Michael Wosje, commander of Carrier Strike Group 1 was quoted as saying. As fellow maricreated_at nations, we share the common goal of a free and open Indo-Pacific, assuring access to the seas.\nBilateral exercises in the region have grown in scale, scope and complexity, said Capt. Matthew Thomas, commanding officer of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.\nTensions between the Philippines and China have been escalating in the last few months, with regular confrontations between their coast guard vessels.\nOne day before China's drills, on Jan. 16, officials from the two countries met under a bilateral consultation mechanism and agreed to seek common ground and find ways to cooperate to ease the tension in the South China Sea.\nPhilippine Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Theresa Lazaro said in her opening remarks at the talks that she believed there was always genuine space for diplomatic and pragmatic cooperation.\nYet with the drills taking place so soon after the talks, it seems a solution remains far out of reach.\nChina has lodged serious protests regarding the Philippines' recent maricreated_at infringement and provocative activities as well as its peddling of the maricreated_at disputes between China and the Philippines, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "text": "\n2025 JAN 22 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Politics, Law & Government Daily -- Current study results on Global Views - Asian Studies have been published. According to news originating from Singapore, Singapore, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Despite having no territorial claim in the South China Sea, why has Australia publicly voiced concerns? What factors led to the shift in its South China Sea policy during the 2010s? By integrating role theory with the balance of threat theory and analyzing official documents, I argue that Australia's role conception in the South China Sea and its perception of the 'China threat' have primarily shaped its policy on this issue. Driven by its assertive actor role, Australia has felt obligated to take positions on disputed events.\" \n Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Nanyang Technological University, \"An intensified perception of China as a threat has led Australia to adopt a more confrontational posture, bringing it into closer alignment with the United States. This case study of Australia's South China Sea policy illustrates the broader dynamics of how regional countries navigate the complexities of great power competition.\" \n According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"It highlights that alignment reformulation arises not only from external pressures but also from ideational factors.\" \n This research has been peer-reviewed. \n For more information on this research see: Role and Threat: an Assessment of Australia's South China Sea Policy Amid Great Power Rivalry.

Does he have a coherent plan for Indonesia? Or is it too early to criticise and evaluate his approach? ISEAS academic Leo Suryadinata tells us more.",

    "text": "\n                        On 9 December 2024, General Agus Subiyanto, commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces, announced a large-scale reshuffling of 300 senior officers: 143 from the Army, 92 from the Navy, and 65 from the Air Force. This move was primarily aimed at consolidating the power of Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. Among these senior officers, some were close associates of former President Joko Widodo (Jokowi). Now that Prabowo has officially assumed the presidency, he is positioning his trusted allies in key positions or promoting generals previously sidelined by Jokowi. These individuals are expected to be unwaveringly loyal to Prabowo.\n                        One example is Major General Kunto Arief Wibowo, previously the commander of the Regional Command III. During the 2024 presidential election, he wrote an article warning that military personnel must remain neutral, which led to his reassignment by Jokowi. Now, Prabowo has appointed him as commander of the Joint Regional Defense Command I. Analysts believe this role requires someone Prabowo trusts, as it pertains to the Natuna Sea. Prabowo seems to have a new strategy regarding the South China Sea.\n                        Observers speculate that Prabowo has made concessions to China regarding these areas in exchange for Chinese support, particularly in economic and technological assistance. However, Indonesia takes a slightly different view.\n                        The South China Sea remains a pressing issue\n                        Analysts suggest that Prabowo had already made concessions on the South China Sea issue in September 2024. According to a China-Indonesia joint statement in English released by China, Indonesia and China agreed to jointly develop “areas of overlapping claims”. This implied a shift in Indonesia’s previous stance to one that recognised China’s nine-dash line. However, shortly thereafter, Indonesia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement in Indonesian, clarifying that the joint statement does not imply Indonesia’s recognition of the nine-dash line. The statement also reiterated that China’s nine-dash line lacks legal basis under international law, is not recognised by the International Tribunal, and is inconsistent with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). However, the statement did not explicitly criticise the wording of the China-Indonesia joint statement. These discrepancies show that both sides have diverging interpretations.\n                        Chinese Maricreated_at Militia vessels are pictured near the Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea, on 5 March 2024.\n                        China believes that under the joint statement, Jakarta has reached a consensus with Beijing, and that both countries will jointly develop “areas of overlapping claims”. Observers speculate that Prabowo has made concessions to China regarding these areas in exchange for Chinese support, particularly in economic and technological assistance. However, Indonesia takes a slightly different view.\n                        Prabowo may not have anticipated that doing so would be perceived as a shift in Indonesia’s stance on the South China Sea issue that affects the interests of ASEAN claimant states.\n                        According to this view, Prabowo wants to show his willingness to cooperate with China without really having joint development in the “areas of overlapping claims”. This is due to the fact that in practice, any such development would require alignment with Indonesia’s current laws and regulations. Since Indonesia adheres to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, it does not recognise the nine-dash line, meaning there are no “areas of overlapping claims” with China. The proposed joint development project would conflict with existing Indonesian laws, making it unfeasible. However, Prabowo may not have anticipated that doing so would be perceived as a shift in Indonesia’s stance on the South China Sea issue that affects the interests of ASEAN claimant states.\n                        Notably, after China released the joint statement, Prabowo gave a speech affirming his commitment to safeguard Indonesia’s sovereignty and prevent foreign violations. Yet he also remarked that he would always try to look for the possibility of a partnership, as partnerships are better than conflicts. He appeared to hint to China that Indonesia would not compromise on sovereignty issues, while simultaneously signalling to the US not to provoke conflicts in the South China Sea.\n                        Former US President Joe Biden meets with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, US, on 12 November 2024.\n                        Following his visit to China, Prabowo also visited the US, where a joint statement was issued between the two nations’ leaders. On the South China Sea issue, the joint statement did not mention the nine-dash line but did make a reference to the 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling under UNCLOS, which invalidated the nine-dash line. However, China does not recognise this ruling.\n                        Prabowo is thus likely to maintain a good relationship with Trump. However, in his diplomatic approach, Prabowo is expected to continue with a non-aligned policy that avoids taking sides in the US-China rivalry.\n                        Prabowo playing both sides amid geopolitical uncertainty \n                        Prabowo has a personal connection to the US, having received military training there, and seems to hold a favourable view of Donald Trump. When Trump won the US presidency, Prabowo was one of the first world leaders to call and congratulate him, addressing him as “sir”. Trump, in turn, was delighted and bestowed high praise on Prabowo’s capabilities. When Trump complimented his English, Prabowo reportedly replied, “All my training is American, sir.” Prabowo is thus likely to maintain a good relationship with Trump. However, in his diplomatic approach, Prabowo is expected to continue with a non-aligned policy that avoids taking sides in the US-China rivalry.\n                        When it comes to defence, Indonesia conducts large-scale annual military exercises with the US. However, no similar joint operations with China exist. Additionally, the US provides training to enhance Indonesia’s maricreated_at patrol capabilities, and much of Indonesia’s defence equipment is sourced from Western countries, including the US. Therefore, Indonesia has close military and defence ties with the West, particularly the US. However, Indonesia also maintains strong economic relations with China.\n                        World leaders pose for a family photo during the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia,  on 24 October 2024. Indonesia is now officially a full member of BRICS.\n                        The BRICS group, led by Russia, India and China, is a coalition of so-called “developing countries” that aims to break away from US economic dominance by promoting trade outside the US dollar to facilitate freer and more profitable commerce. Prabowo recently announced that Indonesia is now officially a full member of BRICS, expressing a desire to serve as a “bridge between developed and developing nations” . Because Indonesia prides itself on its non-aligned stance, it also applied last year to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group of developed nations led by the US. However, its application has yet to be accepted.\n                        Indonesia is a trade-surplus country with the US, exporting minerals, agricultural and fishery products, electronics, and labour-intensive goods. Trump has previously warned BRICS members that their exports to the US could face a 100% tariff, a significant threat to Indonesia, as losing the US market would heavily impact its national revenue. However, analysts believe that if Trump were to impose such sanctions, it might drive Indonesia closer to China. Given Indonesia’s strategic importance in the Asia-Pacific region, it is unlikely that Trump would take such drastic measures.\n                        Inconsistent political approach?\n                        Some analysts note that Prabowo, despite being democratically elected, exhibits tendencies that are less democratic. For instance, in December last year, he proposed that direct elections for local governors and mayors should be abolished, suggesting instead that regional councillors elect and appoint these officials. He argued that this approach would reduce national expenditures and improve efficiency. The proposal sparked heated debate. While many political party members welcomed the idea, pro-democracy advocates criticised it as undemocratic. They argue that the government should work to improve the existing system of direct elections for local officials to strengthen Indonesia’s democracy, rather than remove elections.\n                        Students eat lunch on the first day of a free-meal programme at PGRI 6 Junior High School in Bogor, West Java, on 6 January 2025.\n                        Prabowo’s leadership style is also distinctly military. Upon assuming office, he organised a military-style retreat for his cabinet ministers to deliver instructions. He expressed his vision of transforming Indonesia into a technologically advanced and powerful nation, emphasising that national strength requires a healthy and well-educated population.\n                        To this end, he introduced a programme providing free and nutritious lunches for students and pregnant women, which was implemented on 6 January 2025. He has also prioritised improving Indonesia’s education system, particularly higher education and scientific research, aiming to position Indonesia as a developed nation by 2045. Achieving these goals will require substantial funding, so Prabowo has set an ambitious target of increasing Indonesia’s economic growth rate from 5% to 8%. Achieving this goal is challenging, and he has tasked his ministers with making it a reality.\n                        Although Prabowo is a diplomatically-focused president, he understands that domestic, political and economic stability are crucial to securing his position. \n                        Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka, and newly appointed cabinet ministers pose for photographs after the inauguration of the new cabinet, at the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 21 October 2024.\n                        However, Prabowo’s cabinet is oversized, comprising over 100 ministers and deputy ministers with varying levels of competence. Shortly after taking office, some ministers have performed poorly. For instance, Minister of Villages and Development of Disadvantaged Regions Yandri Susanto misused his position and violated regulations by using an official letterhead for invitations to his mother’s birthday celebration. Similarly, Minister of Human Rights Natalius Pigai complained about insufficient departmental funding, openly requesting a huge budget of 20 trillion rupiah (US$1.2 billion). The bloated cabinet not only drains national resources but also hampers efficiency.\n                        Too early to judge Prawobo’s performance?\n                        Although Prabowo is a diplomatically-focused president, he understands that domestic, political and economic stability are crucial to securing his position. He has thus taken steps to strengthen his leadership and tasked his ministers with increasing state revenue. Many business leaders have cooperated with Prabowo, providing funding needed by the government. In an effort to boost state revenue, he recently proposed granting amnesty to corrupt officials if they return stolen funds to the state and express genuine remorse. This proposal has drawn significant criticism. Additionally, his Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs announced a plan to raise the value-added tax (VAT) from 11% to 12%, which also faced backlash. As a result, the government decided to maintain the VAT at 11%, with the 12% rate only applying to luxury goods.\n                        However, Prabowo has been in office for less than 100 days. While the economy remains relatively stable, the challenges ahead are significant, and it is still too early to fully evaluate his administration’s performance.\n                        This article was first published in Lianhe Zaobao as “普拉博沃就职后的印尼政治和外交”. \n                        Related: Indonesia joins BRICS: A strategic step towards global south empowerment | Has Prabowo changed Indonesia’s stance on the South China Sea?\n                        This handout picture taken and released by Indonesia’s presidential palace on 25 October 2024, shows president Prabowo Subianto (right) flanked by defence minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin (left), commander-in-chief of the Indonesian army General Agus Subiyanto (second from left) and police commissioner general Listyo Sigit Prabowo (centre), at the military academy during their cabinet retreat in Magelang, Central Java.\n"

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:\nSo-called freedom of navigation operations, or FONOPs, that the U.S. Navy has been carrying out against China's extensive maricreated_at claims in the South China Sea, have proved ineffective and even risk escalating tensions, Australian research found.\nThe findings, in the paper \"Don't Shoot the Messenger: Perception and Misperception in the South China Sea,\" by Nell Bennett, are part of the Blue Security program, a collaboration between various Australian universities and institutes.\nBennett, a researcher specializing in maricreated_at and naval affairs, looked into the FONOP program between 2016 and 2023 when, in her opinion, the U.S. made the South China Sea a focus and directed its attention towards China's maricreated_at claims there.\n\"The seven-year FONOP program has seen China go from measured rejection of U.S. messages to more explicit hostility,\" Bennett said in the report.\n\"China did not accept the messages that the U.S. sought to send through its FONOP program,\" she said, adding that as China's behavior remains unaltered and becomes even more belligerent, the FONOPs are deemed unsuccessful.\n'Strategic communication'\nFreedom of navigation, according to the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea , or UNCLOS, is the right of all states to sail the high seas, as well as to fly over them, without interference from other states.\nSince 1979, the United States has conducted FONOPs to uphold UNCLOS provisions and reject \"unlawful attempts by coastal states to restrict the rights and freedoms of navigation and overflight as well as other lawful uses of the sea,\" as defined by the Pentagon.\nThe USS Chung-Hoon observes a Chinese navy ship conduct what it called an \"unsafe\" Chinese maneuver in the Taiwan Strait, Saturday, June 3, 2023.(Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Andre T. Richard/AP)\nThe U.S. campaign shows that the United States \"does not acquiesce to the excessive maricreated_at claims by other nations and prevents them from becoming accepted customary international law,\" the Department of Defense said in an annual report.\nSince the end of 2015, U.S. naval ships regularly sailed near disputed features in the South China Sea, as well as in the Taiwan Strait, to challenge the claims by not only China but also by others, such as Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan, that the U.S. views as inconsistent with UNCLOS.\nThe report's author considered FONOPs a form of strategic communication, or \"messages that are communicated to advance a strategic objective.\"\n\"The idea is that the state will receive the message and either reconsider or change its course of action,\" Bennett wrote.\nHowever, despite the 46 reported FONOPs in the South China Sea from 2016 to 2023, \"China's responses became more oppositional over created_at.\"\n\"Not only did China use U.S. actions as justification for its own militarization, but it also made a thinly veiled threat of retaliation,\" the researcher said, citing statements by Chinese military officials and media reports.\nThe key factor that will determine whether a message will be accepted is the pre-existing relationship between the states, Bennett argued, and as China viewed the U.S. as a competitor and potential threat, it was predisposed to reject the U.S. communication, which is unlikely to bring about any change in Beijing's behavior.\n\"This argument actually has been floating around since FONOPs started,\" said Collin Koh, senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, who recorded every FONOP by U.S. and allied vessels in the region.\n\"I think the whole idea, firstly, is to let China know it's created_at to roll back on its excessive maricreated_at claims, but notext has realistically expected to achieve Beijing's rolling back so it is a bit hasty to say it's unsuccessful,\" Koh told Radio Free Asia.\nChina would still conduct land reclamation and military exercises to exert control according to its plans and strategies, but the U.S. FONOPs had helped to deter Beijing's \"gray zone\" campaign of coercive pressure, he added.\n\"An in-depth study is needed to reach conclusions,\" Koh said.\nSometext cares\nIn Koh's opinion, the U.S. strategic messaging is also intended to reassure countries in the region about Washington's stabilizing role, \"that is to say that there is sometext who cares.\"\n\"At least one country acts for public common good and its actions should be appreciated by all countries facing China's aggression,\" Koh said.\nAn F/A-18F Super Hornet, assigned to the \"Bounty Hunters\" of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 2, launches from the flight deck of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70), Jan. 21, 2025.(U.S. Navy)\n\"I don't think FONOPs are designed to stop Chinese aggression,\" said Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, or ASPI, a government think tank.\n\"They are there to demonstrate to Beijing that the U.S. maintains the right to sail in international waters and challenges China's illegal claims to territory.\"\nOnly China has publicly and officially protested against the U.S. FONOPs that it sees as disruptive and \"a grave threat to China's sovereignty and security.\"\nRELATED STORIES\nChina holds drills as Philippines, US conduct exercise in South China Sea\nUS, Canadian warships conduct joint drills in South China Sea\nPhilippines, US, Japan stage joint naval maneuvers in South China Sea\nIn her research, Bennett also noticed that the Philippines remained supportive of U.S. messaging and its media \"even adopted the rhetoric and justifications that the U.S. provided in support of the operations.\"\n\"Many would argue that [without the FONOPs] it would be more challenging to send clear, consistent messages to Beijing regarding international law and territorial disputes in the South China Sea,\" said Troy Lee-Brown, project manager of Blue Security and co-editor of Blue Security Maricreated_at Affairs Series.\n\"However, ultimately, as the author Nell Bennett points out, the effectiveness of FONOPs depends on how they are perceived.\"\n\"So, there is a tension there between the two points of view on their efficacy,\" Lee-Brown told RFA.\nLee-Brown suggested that FONOPs \"should ideally be complimented by other forms of strategic communication\" diplomatically, through statements and declarations, military presence and exercises with partners and allies, and legal and normative advocacy amongst other aspects.\nA Royal Australian Air Force P-8A Poseidon aircraft conducts a fly-over of Philippine Navy ships, a Japan Maricreated_at Self-Defense Force ship, as well as U.S., New Zealand Navy and Australian Navy ships during a Maricreated_at Cooperative Activity in the South China Sea on Sept. 28, 2024.(U.S. Navy)\nAnalysts also pointed out that the U.S. not being a party to UNCLOS presents challenges to its advocating a rules-based order in the South China Sea.\n\"However, the U.S. has consistently observed UNCLOS as customary international law and conducts operations in accordance with its principles,\" Lee-Brown added.\nASPI's Malcolm Davis said it's important that the U.S. maintains FONOPs and \"it's also important that other U.S. allies participate in one way or another, or, like Australia, undertake similar operations to demonstrate international law at sea.\"\nEdited by Mike Firn.\n"

    "title": "tenuous 'win' claimed in shoal resupply deal",
    "created_at": "2025-01-22",
    "text": "\nIn a rare moment of accord amid their simmering feud over the South China Sea, Beijing and Manila have agreed to maintain a provisional deal allowing the Philippines to resupply a remote outpost at the Second Thomas Shoal - a move hailed as a \"win\" for Manila, albeit one fraught with uncertainty. \nThe agreement, reached during the 10th bilateral consultation mechanism (BCM) meeting in Xiamen last Thursday, comes as the Philippines continues to push back against what it calls a rising tide of Chinese incursions in the South China Sea.  \nThe BCM, established as a forum for dialogue, has often been weighed down by the deep mistrust between the two neighbours. But this created_at, envoys described the talks as \"frank and constructive\", according to the Philippines' foreign affairs department. \nDespite the diplomatic veneer, tensions remain high. Just days before the meeting, Manila lodged a fresh protest against the deployment of China's 165-metre-long coastguard vessel 5901 - ominously dubbed \"the monster\" - which was spotted just 77 nautical miles off the Philippine coast.  \nThe Philippines condemned the move as a violation of its exclusive economic zone, citing the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and Manila's recently enacted Maricreated_at Zones Act. \nChina, for its part, has shown no signs of toning down its presence in contested waters, including Scarborough Shoal, which it has controlled since a 2012 clash with Philippine forces.  \nThe shoal - known in the Philippines as Bajo de Masinloc - remains a flashpoint, and was the reason Manila filed an arbitration case against Beijing at The Hague. Beijing has dismissed the 2016 ruling that invalidated its expansive claim over much of the South China Sea. \nStill, the agreement on resupply missions represents a rare moment of compromise. For years, the Second Thomas Shoal has been a symbol of Manila's defiance, with the rusting BRP Sierra Madre - a World War II-era warship intentionally grounded on the shoal - serving as the Philippines' foothold.  \nChinese coastguard vessels have repeatedly tried to block resupply efforts to the outpost, even resorting to aggressive tactics that led to a Philippine serviceman losing a thumb in a past skirmish. \nLast Thursday's meeting \"shows that the Philippines is able to get [China] to agree to commit. It's a win,\" said Julio Amador, interim president of the Foundation for the National Interest and a trustee at the non-profit organisation Facts Asia. The agreement \"commits both states to a status quo\", Amador said. \nBut he was quick to caution against complacency, saying Beijing would continue probing for vulnerabilities. He urged Manila to \"stop announcing to the world its weakness\" and adopt a more strategic approach. \nAt last week's meeting, the two sides reportedly explored areas of cooperation too, including ocean meteorology and coastguard collaboration.  \nThese proposals built upon a joint coastguard committee formed in 2016 and the \"direct communication line\" for maricreated_at concerns that Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr and China's Xi Jinping agreed to set up in January 2023.  \nPhilippine Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Theresa Lazaro said the continued implementation of the resupply deal was essential to the \"de-escalation of tensions\" without compromising national interests.  \nBoth sides had \"exchanged views\" and \"acknowledged ... positive outcomes\", Lazaro said.  \n\"Our position is clear and consistent, but so is our willingness to engage in dialogue,\" she said. \nBeijing and Manila reached a provisional agreement on resupply missions to the Second Thomas Shoal last year. \nGeopolitical analysts remain sceptical of China's intentions, however. Don McLain Gill, a lecturer in international relations at De La Salle University in Manila, said Beijing had a habit of \"throwing its weight around\" and warned Manila must not compromise on its core interests.  \n\"The most important thing is that we hold our ground and we stay consistent,\" he said. \nNational Security Council spokesman Jonathan Malaya recently admitted the Philippines felt China was \"pushing us to the wall\" and said Manila might have to file another case against Beijing.  \nBut analysts warn litigation alone is unlikely to shift the dynamics in the South China Sea, where Beijing's strategy of ­incremental encroachment has left its neighbours scrambling for answers. \nAs the Philippines prepares to host the next BCM later this year, the question remains: can these fragile agreements hold against the tide of escalating tensions?  \nFor now, Manila has secured what some see as a tenuous victory. But in the high-stakes chessboard of the South China Sea, every move counts - and every misstep could tip the balance.\n"

But the cost, sophistication, and nature of this capability and the timing fuel doubts, adding to the boiling cross-Strait flashpoint.\nSouth China Sea or Taiwan Strait? \nTyphon MRC was installed in Laoag in northern Luzon during a joint Philippines-United States exercise last April and has stayed since, much to China's chagrin. Laoag City is the capital of Ilocos Norte province, the stronghold of the powerful Marcos family. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. served as vice governor, governor, and representative of the province's second district. His late father, strongman Ferdinand Sr., also served as a representative before becoming a senator and, eventually, president. Hence, stationing Typhon in the city suggests it has the nod from the highest official in the land. Choosing Laoag may be both strategic and expedient, given its location and buy-in of national and local leadership. Other provinces, like neighboring Cagayan, have aired unease about increased U.S. military presence, worried this may affect Chinese investments and put them directly in harm's way should hostilities break out.\nThe storm brought by the appearance of the Typhon was preceded by the expansion of U.S. military access in the northern theater closer to Taiwan. This fueled speculation that the move was more in line with a cross-Strait crisis rather than deterring China in the South China Sea. From where it is presently fixed, the MRC can fire missiles that can hit targets way beyond the South China Sea, including the Mainland, Taiwan, and parts of the Western Pacific. Beijing replied to this unprecedented prolonged arms deployment by staging its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test in 44 years.\nThe Typhon deployment infuriated China. Not even U.S. allies, such as Japan and South Korea, have allowed installment of the platform on their territory, possibly anticipating China's reaction. While Seoul's THAAD bid may be understood in light of Pyongyang's growing nuclear and ballistic arsenal, no other South China Sea claimant has seen China's maricreated_at grab in such stark view as to warrant hosting a foreign lethal missile system on their soil. Beijing claimed the move was destabilizing, a view Manila was quick to refute. Likely to assert agency, Manila said it is keen to induct a Typhon to strengthen its defense posture. Owning the capability may be a ploy to allay concerns that the country is simply granting the U.S. free reign to use its territory for its larger strategic goals. The logic is that Philippine-owned U.S. arms on Philippine soil mean the button will be pushed by someone from Manila, not Washington. This is akin to South Korea's order for a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery, which also riled Seoul's ties with Beijing.\nNo bystander? But at what cost and risk? \nDue to its proximity and the presence of over 150,000 Filipino nationals in Taiwan, a cross-Strait emergency presents dilemmas for the Philippines. Manila already struggles to deal with Beijing in the South China Sea in the west and would not wish to have another front in the north. But the prospect of a forceful takeover of the self-ruled island worries the Southeast Asian country. While Manila abides by the \"One China Policy,\" it maintains unofficial ties with Taipei, which is also an important trade partner and investor.\nAllied exercises in northern Luzon and Batanes, expanded American military footprint, and Typhon's indeterminate placing in that space can be seen from the prism of the Taiwan crisis. Three of the four new agreed locations for US military presence are in northern Luzon. For the first created_at in the history of the Philippines-US Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), a naval base was opened for US access. Camilo Osias Base in Santa Ana, Cagayan stares at Taiwan across the Luzon Strait. Four of the five original EDCA locations are all air bases further south. The other one is an army base. Typhon was stationed at Laoag International Airport. Another new EDCA site was the Lal-lo airport in Cagayan. That both Laoag and Lal-lo are civilian airports suggests that even strategic non-military real estate can be tapped in a possible contingency operation.\nAll these developments give the impression that Manila is warming up to a possible Taiwan emergency, which some estimate may happen by 2027. Washington is reportedly keen on building a potential dual-use port in Batanes closer to Taiwan. Northern Luzon was a theater for joint Philippine-U.S. military exercises last year. Last October, Philippine and U.S. marines staged drills to evacuate displaced Filipino migrant workers, a scenario that may happen should armed conflict break out. Hence, Beijing's intensified pressure on its smaller neighbor may be more in reply to Manila taking steps aligned with the U.S. broader deterrence initiative to prevent Beijing from using force against the island.\nMarcos said that EDCA sites will not be used as staging grounds to target another country. EDCA facilities are also said to be useful for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations. Northern Luzon and Batanes being at-risk for strong typhoons make it a palatable pretext. But China is not buying it and is vigilantly watching Philippine and U.S. actions in this space. Beijing discourages other countries from intervening in the Taiwan issue, saying it is a domestic matter. Even before its ICBM test, China had already warned the U.S. and its neighbors to stay clear of Taiwan. The southernmost of the six exclusion zones where China undertook drills in response to the 2022 visit of former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taipei included waters and airspace off northern Batanes. Five ballistic missiles fired by China during that exercise landed in Japan's EEZ. These actions are messages to Manila and Tokyo, two US allies closest to Taiwan, and are counted upon by Washington as crucial in deterring forcible attempts to change the status quo across the Strait.\nPhilippine participation in a Taiwan emergency is a delicate issue. Repatriating its nationals in Taiwan is a top priority for Manila. It may also help evacuate other foreign nationals, including citizens of fellow ASEAN countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand, which also have big communities on the democratic island. Manila may also permit medical evacuation to Batanes. Delivery of food, medicines, and other basic humanitarian supplies may be considered. Further steps may depend on the country's comfort level, given the grave hazards involved. Pressure from the U.S. is expected, especially if the latter decides to play a big role in Taiwan's defense, something to watch under the second Trump administration. However, an anxious domestic Filipino public may also dissuade the government from joining the fray, especially if the stakes are not sufficiently conveyed.\nDue to its own turbulent ties with Beijing over the South China Sea and its traditionally strong alliance with the U.S., Manila may not be in a good position to broker a cross-Strait dialogue. But predisposing the country to bear U.S. arms as the only way to matter in a Taiwan Strait crisis shows a dearth in imagination. As a founding father of ASEAN, the Philippines, at the minimum, can support ASEAN or an ASEAN country like Singapore or Indonesia to play a more robust role in defusing tensions.\n - This article was published at China-US Focus and draws from the author's prior work published in Italian text: Pitlo, Lucio III B. \"Manila Morirebbe Per Gli Scogli Ma Non Per Taiwan.\" Limes (Rivista Italiana di Geopolitica) No. 10 (November 2024). 223-231.\n"

    "text": "\nThere will always be border disputes in Asia, and China should not be singled out because of tensions in the South China Sea, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Wednesday.\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Anwar said that Malaysia had border issues with Singapore and its other neighbours in Southeast Asia but they still managed to cultivate good relations.\nWhile Malaysia also has maricreated_at issues with China, it will push ahead with improving ties because it is an important country, he said.\n\"We have excellent relationship with Singapore. We still have border issues with them,\" Anwar said.\n\"I treat the Thais as my family members, the leaders, but still we have some border issues with them. So it is with Indonesia, with the Philippines.\n\"(But) we don't go to war, we don't threaten. We do discuss. We get a bit... angry, but we do focus on the economic fundamentals and move on,\" he added.\n\"Why is it that we must then single out China as an issue?\" Anwar asked.\n\"That's my only contention. Do I have an issue about it? Yes, but do I have a problem? No. Do we have any undesired tensions? No,\" he said.\nHe said that while Malaysia has strong ties with the United States, China is an important neighbour that it must also engage with.\n\"Of course, people highlight the issue of the South China Sea... But may I remind you that Malaysia is a maricreated_at country,\" he said.\nChina has been \"very reasonable\" in dealing with Malaysia, Anwar added.\n\"They take us seriously, more seriously than many of the countries of our old allies and friends,\" he said, without mentioning any country.\nChina has ruffled diplomatic feathers in Southeast Asia because of its assertion that it owns most of the strategic waterway despite an international ruling that the claim has no legal basis.\nThis has pitted it against Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam, which have partial claims to the sea.\nIn recent years, China and the Philippines have seen an escalation of confrontations, including boat-ramming incidents and Chinese ships firing water cannons on Filipino vessels.\nThe clashes have sparked concern they could draw the United States, Manila's long-created_at security ally, into armed conflict with China.\nllk-mba/js\n"

    "text": "\nTHE new year is 22 days old today, and already Malaysia is setting the tone â€” regionally and globally â€” for the remaining 343 days. Make no mistake, Malaysia is no superpower. Mighty powers, from the region and outside, would want to shape the moment as their geopolitical interests dictate. But it has a chance to stand up and be counted. This is the moment, a hinge moment, as the consultant-types would badge it. Malaysia can choose to be the aileron to shift the hinge line of control.\nPutrajaya has already done that in a regional way as the chair of Asean since Jan 1. A clear signal of the shift came on Sunday out of Langkawi, the venue for the Asean's Foreign Ministers Retreat, when Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan urged the regional bloc to assert its voice and chart its own course rather than be swayed by external forces. Asean's voice has a heft of its own, but the bloc finds it hard to get all 10 members to speak with one voice on key issues. One such is on how to deal with the military regime in Myanmar after it overthrew a democratically elected government on Feb 1, 2021, and went on a rampage of violence, killing and torturing civilians. The violence has grown complicated in the last two years, with rebel groups adding to the bloodshed. Next month will be the fourth anniversary of the coup. Not speaking with one voice means choosing to see the violence continue.\nAnother lingering issue is China's claims over almost all of the South China Sea, much of which overlap with those of other Asean members. Besides calling for all parties to the dispute to respect international law, Asean has been negotiating with China to draft a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea, but progress is slow. In the meancreated_at, China has adopted a confrontational stance against the other claimants. The Philippines has been the most vociferous against Beijing's aggression, having taken its case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in 2013 as provided for under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The PCA's award issued on July 12, 2016, confirmed the sovereign rights of the Philippines over its 200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zone in the West Philippine Sea while rejecting China's \"nine-dash line\" claim. China rejects the PCA award. Like it or not, this has forced Manila to seek the help of the United States. One form such a help has taken is joint maricreated_at exercises, now into the fifth since it began in 2023. The two-day exercise, whose aim is to help Manila assert its sovereign rights, came after Manila complained about the presence of Chinese coast guard vessels inside its maricreated_at zone. The military route is certainly not the right way to solve maricreated_at disputes. The code of conduct based on international law is. China and Asean will do well to conclude it soonest.\nGlobally, too, Malaysia is setting the pace for a just and humane global order by calling out the West's hypocrisy, a might-is-right hegemonic evil that has bred a heartless world. There is no place in this 21st century for such neo-barbarism. Well done, Malaysia.\n( END )\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines runs one the most liberalised oil and gas markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The government is not involved in the downstream wholesale and retail fuel markets, with its main tasks being regulating, enforcing and monitoring retail fuel price movements.The upstream industry faces several challenges to reverse depleting oil and gas reserves amid lack of interest from foreign investors. The government has promote foreign investment in the upstream sector without much success since the operators of the existing oil and gas fields are unwilling to commit investments due to depletion and a lack of major new discoveries. \nDomestic oil production is centred on the offshore Galoc and onshore Alegria oil fields.AThe exit of international oil companies has further undermined the industryaEURtms attractiveness. Although there is potential for joint exploration activities with Mainland China in the South China Sea, the markets have not reached a concrete agreement to commit investments for exploration activities. Philippine National Oil Company and China National Oil Corporation initially agreed to jointly conduct exploration in the South China Sea, but no progress has been made due to ongoing maricreated_at disputes.Downstream refining industry faces similar challenges as the refining capacity was reduced to just one refinery following the closure of ShellaEURtms Batangas refinery in 2020. Petron contemplated investment in a 100,000 b/d condensate splitter integrated with an aromatics unit, but the project failed to take off. Refinery upgrading projects are centred on improving energy efficiency, refining margins and production of cleaner fuels. The countryaEURtms dependence in refined fuels imports has risen significantly due to the loss of supplies stemming from refinery closure. Currently, downstream fuel markets offer opportunities for fuel importers, traders and distributors, but the market is increasingly becoming overcrowded with numerous industry players.In terms of gas consumption, the Philippines presents significant opportunities for LNG and LPG imports in the short-to-long term given the lack of domestic production. Plans to build new LNG-fired power plants could offer significant opportunities for LNG imports. The government has approved six LNG import terminals, of which three began commercial operations in 2023.In addition, there is significant latent demand for LPG in the residential and commercial sectosr for cooking and other purposes, but potential demand growth remains hampered by the lack of LPG distribution infrastructures. The LPG market is heavily dominated by local firms, led by Petron and Liquigaz. Shell previously accounted a significant share of the LPG market, although it is only a minor player currently after selling off its primary LPG business in 2011 to Isla LPG.Petron has assumed the role of sole crude oil refiner in the country after Shell to permanently shut its refinery at Tabangao in 2020. Shell's plant has subsequently been converted into a fuel import terminal and serves end-users across Metro Manila, Southern Luzon and Northern Visayas.The retail fuel market is principally controlled by Petron, holding 21.3%, followed by Shell (15.6%) and Chevron (4.9%); the remaining 58.2% market share is held by several retail and wholesale companies.

    "text": "\nAs Donald Trump reclaims the White House, analysts believe China is taking the opportunity to reshape its diplomatic landscape, particularly with nations that former President Joe Biden sought to court during his tenure.\nIn the wake of Biden's strategy to counter China's growing influence by building alliances with \"like-minded countries,\" China has made notable progress in improving relations with the U.S.'s traditional allies—including Japan, India, and the U.K.\nWhy It Matters\nTrump's return could signal a shift toward a more unilateralist approach, providing China with the chance to recalibrate its foreign policy.\nDuring Biden's administration, the U.S. reinvigorated the Quad alliance, consisting of the United States, India, Japan, and Australia, in a bid to counterbalance China's economic and military power in the Indo-Pacific.\nWhat To Know\nWhile Beijing strengthens ties with key players in this grouping, the future of Biden's legacy in the region appears uncertain.\nSome observers predict that Trump's approach could weaken U.S. alliances, but others point out that his policies successfully rallied global partners to adopt a more competitive stance toward China.\nHow Far Along Is China in Improving Relations With Us Allies?\nDuring his first term, Trump endorsed Japan's \"Free and Open Indo-Pacific\" strategy and supported efforts to exclude Chinese telecom giants from critical networks in the U.S. and allied countries.\nBut Japan's economic rapprochement with China is still in its early stages, and India has protested Beijing's creation of two new counties in disputed border regions.\nWhat Are the Territorial Disputes in The South China Sea?\nYet, leaders in Australia, the U.K., and Japan have shown a renewed interest in bolstering relations with China, especially given the country's role as the world's largest manufacturer and a key supplier of strategic minerals.\nIn recent weeks, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke with European Council President Antonio Costa, offering to stabilize the globe through enhanced cooperation.\nAdditionally, China and the U.K. resumed economic and financial talks after a six-year hiatus, following visits by senior officials from both nations.\nBut some countries remain cautious. The Philippines remains at odds with China over territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\nDespite a temporary deal to avoid violent confrontationslast year, tensions persist.\nTrump's statements on other international issues have already ruffled feathers among U.S. allies.\nHis recent comments about possibly annexing Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark, and suggesting Canada should become the 51st U.S. state have raised concerns.\nWhat People Are Saying\nWu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan Universityin Shanghai, said \"It is possible that Trump may drift away from U.S. allies, making them pay more attention to China's role, and in fact, it has provided a chance for China's diplomacy. I think we should grasp the chance.\"\nWu explained that for China, improving ties with U.S. allies and boosting economic cooperation is crucial to mitigating the affect of deteriorating China-U. S. relations. He said \"Improving relations with American allies will offset the shock to China-U. S. economic relations.\"\nSun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, said \"Countries want to at the minimum keep their options open. China is unlikely to be a better choice than the U.S., even under Trump, but it is important to find some counterbalance.\"\nWhat Happens Now\nDespite Beijing's warming ties with the U.K. and Japan, significant obstacles remain.\nIn Japan, senior diplomatic visits are rekindling ties, while British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has attempted to steer the U.K. back toward engagement with Beijing, distancing his government from the more confrontational stance of his predecessor, Rishi Sunak.\nThe shifting dynamics reflect a broader recalibration in global diplomacy, with nations looking to hedge their bets amid an unpredictable future under Trump.\nThis article contains additional reporting from The Associated Press\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nChinese President Xi Jinping\nSean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP, File\nChinese President Xi Jinping takes part in the Economic Leaders Meeting during the APEC summit in Lima, Peru on Nov. 16, 2024.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-22",
    "text": "\nAccording to information published on January 20, 2025, by The Korea created_ats, South Korea is nearing a milestone in its defense exports with the finalization of an agreement to supply K9 Thunder self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. Industry and government sources indicate that negotiations between the two nations are in advanced stages, with a contract for approximately 20 units valued at $300 million expected to be finalized in the coming months. This deal would mark South Korea's first arms export to Vietnam and represent a notable development in its efforts to penetrate the Southeast Asian defense market.\nThe K9 Thunder, developed by Hanwha Aerospace, is recognized as one of the most capable artillery systems globally. Equipped with a 155 mm/52 caliber gun, it can achieve a firing range of up to 60 kilometers and is designed for long-range bombardment and rapid-response missions. Vietnams acquisition of this system aligns with its objective to modernize artillery units that currently rely on aging Soviet-era systems and Chinese Type 63 multiple rocket launchers. The expected delivery of these howitzers could enhance Vietnams defense capabilities, particularly in strategic areas near its northern border with China, where military tensions remain high.\nThe K9 Thunder features a welded steel chassis protecting 152 mm shell fragments and small arms fire up to 14.5 mm caliber. Powered by a 1,000-horsepower MTU diesel engine, it achieves a top speed of 67 km/h with a range of 360 kilometers. The system includes hydropneumatic suspension for improved mobility over challenging terrain and integrates modern systems such as CBRN protection, automatic fire control, and precise targeting capabilities. Operated by a five-person crew, the K9 combines firepower, protection, and mobility to meet the demands of contemporary battlefields.\nVietnams interest in the K9 has been evident through multiple bilateral engagements. In 2023, Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang visited South Korea to observe the system in operation and received a detailed briefing from Hanwha Aerospace. In 2024, Vietnamese troops participated in a South Korean Army training program focused on the K9, demonstrating the system's potential role in Vietnams military modernization efforts. If finalized, the deal would make Vietnam the 11th country to operate the K9, joining nations like Australia, Poland, India, and Egypt.\nBeyond its technical advantages, this agreement highlights a strategic shift in Vietnams defense procurement policy. Traditionally reliant on Russian arms, Vietnam is diversifying its supply sources, partly due to sanctions limiting Russias defense exports. The move also reflects Vietnams intent to strengthen its land-based defenses amid increasing tensions with China, particularly concerning territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The decision to acquire the K9 is further inspired by Indias deployment of the system in mountainous terrains similar to Vietnams border regions.\nThis agreement underscores South Korea's growing prominence as a defense supplier on the global stage. With over 1,400 K9 units already delivered or under contract, the system exemplifies Seouls capability to provide advanced military equipment with competitive delivery created_atlines. South Korean manufacturers also stand out for their adaptability, offering technology transfer agreements and localized production options to meet their clients' specific needs.\nThis prospective agreement between South Korea and Vietnam signifies a dual strategic shift. For Hanoi, it represents a critical step in modernizing its armed forces and reducing reliance on Russian equipment. For Seoul, it is an opportunity to enhance its diplomatic and security influence in a region of growing geopolitical importance. If concluded, the deal would pave the way for deeper defense cooperation between the two countries and further solidify the K9 Thunders reputation as a leading self-propelled artillery system worldwide.\nDefense relations between South Korea and Vietnam have seen significant progress in recent years, driven by a series of initiatives to enhance bilateral military cooperation. In September 2024, Vietnamese Chief of General Staff General Nguyen Tan Cuong hosted South Korean Air Force Chief of Staff General Lee Young Su to discuss strengthening military ties. This meeting built on a comprehensive strategic partnership established in December 2022, aimed at advancing collaboration in areas such as maricreated_at security, defense industry, and UN peacekeeping operations. Both countries have also agreed to deepen cultural and political exchanges while supporting each others positions on key regional issues, including the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and stability in the South China Sea.\n"

    "text": "\nTwo Philippine Air Force FA-50PHs in the 2024 US-Philippine joint Maricreated_at Cooperative Activity in the West Philippine Sea. (Philippine Air Force)\nSYDNEY — The Philippines has decided to double the size of its FA-50 light fighter fleet, reportedly buying another 12 from South Korea, in a move that analysts told Breaking Defense won’t get China off Manila’s back but could complicate Beijing’s plans.\nThe new order, revealed by the Philippines Department of National Defense in a Procurement Monitoring Report earlier this month, is valued at P40 billion ($683 million). The document doens’t list aircraft figures, but media reports, like the Asia Pacific Defense Journal, say it’s for a dozen of the airframes.\nThe additional fighters represent a significant leap in capability for the vast island archipelago, two analysts told Breaking Defense, but they are unlikely to pose a serious threat to China’s most advanced fighters, such as the J-20.\nChina has persistently and often daringly pressed Philippine forces to try and dislodge them from the Thomas and Sabina Shoals and other features in the South China Sea to which it lays claim.\nIn addition to any complications for China, the purchase from South Korea’s KAI, following an initial $420 million order placed in 2014, even more closely binds the Philippines to another US ally and highlights the costs to China of its bullying.\n“This purchase marks a significant departure from past policy which allowed the Philippine Air Force capability to wither in the post-Cold War years. It marks a policy failure for China as well: the exercise of adversarial grey zone tactics with the maricreated_at militia and coast guard as the vanguard for Chinese sharp power, has effectively backfired,” John Blaxland, head of The Australian National University’s Washington office and China expert, wrote in an email to Breaking Defense.\nHe said that, despite past concessions from the Philippines to China, “persistent PRC assertiveness has generated growing Philippine resolve to push back and to work more closely with other like-minded powers, other US treaty allies, including not only Korea, but Japan and Australia, and the United States itself.“\nBlaxland added, “The increased cooperation with South Korea is significant … but we shouldn’t read too much into it. After all Korea is going through an unprecedented political upheaval that could lead to a significant shift in foreign and defense policy priorities for Korea.”\nIn terms of the aircraft’s technical capabilities, Malcolm Davis, a China defense expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense the FA-50 is “a capable lightweight fighter, and if flown by a well trained pilot, would certainly pose a challenge for the PLAAF’s older combat aircraft, or combat support assets such as maricreated_at patrol aircraft, or airborne early warning platforms.” But going up against Chinese fighters such as the J-16, J-20 or J-35 would be problematic.\n“At the moment they are only equipped with within visual range missiles, so the Chinese have a significant ‘first look, first shot, first kill’ advantage. As the FA-50 is upgraded in the future, with AESA radars, and BVR [Beyond Visual Range] missiles, that advantage should become less apparent,” Davis wrote in an email.\nAll this raises the bigger question, will China curtail or halt its persistent attempts to claim waters to which a UN tribunal ruled it has no valid claim?\n“China will be watching closely to see if the purchase of these aircraft affect Philippine policy towards defense of their interests in the South China Sea,” Blaxland wrote. It will be years before that’s known, “as it will take created_at for the aircraft to turn up and crews to be fully trained and prepared to use them.”\nBut he also said he thinks the purchase is especially important because the Philippines Air Force “has long been one of the weakest in the region. Its capability is less than that that which defended the country during the Pacific War in 1942. So this additional capability is a significant leap, but from a low base and China likely won’t be overly intimidated by this.”\nDavis also opined that he doubted the PLAAF will change their operational posture much as a result of the PAF getting another squadron of FA-50s. “They may rotate some of the older aircraft (i.e. older J-10s, J-11s or Su-30s) away in favor of deploying newer platforms, but I’d say their overall day-to-day readiness and (force) posture will remain in place,” he wrote.\n"

This event marks the first created_at a senior Chinese official has attended a U.S. presidential swearing-in ceremony, which traditionally sees foreign leaders opting not to attend in person but rather sending lower-ranking officials or diplomats instead.Han's presence is seen as a diplomatic gesture from Beijing, indicating a willingness to engage with the incoming Trump administration amidst ongoing tensions between the two nations over trade, technology, and geopolitical issues. The Chinese government expressed hopes for \"win-win cooperation\" and stable bilateral relations during Han's visit. \nAnalysts suggest that this move could be interpreted as an attempt by China to reset its relationship with the U.S. following years of strained interactions under previous administrations.Activist BacklashDespite the diplomatic overtures, Han's attendance has drawn criticism from various activist groups who view it as an endorsement of Trump's policies, which they argue have been detrimental to human rights and global stability. Activists are concerned that such high-level engagement could legitimize Trump's administration, particularly given his controversial stances on issues like trade tariffs and immigration policy.Moreover, there are fears that Han's presence may overshadow critical discussions regarding China's human rights record and its aggressive stance in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly concerning Taiwan and territorial disputes in the South China Sea.ConclusionAs the inauguration unfolds, the implications of Han Zheng's attendance will likely continue to be debated among political analysts and activists alike.

    "text": "\n New vessels - which have extendable ramps - could be part of strategy to boost amphibious capabilities by allowing for faster landings   \nNew barges being built in China could strengthen the amphibious capabilities of the People's Liberation Army against Taiwan and other targets by enabling faster landings, according to analysts. \n\"At least three\" of the barges are under construction, defence website Naval News reported earlier this month citing multiple sources. \nThe vessels are said to be equipped with ramps that can extend more than 120 metres (over 390 feet) from the front of the barge. They could be used to reach a coastal road or hard surface beyond a beach to deliver equipment such as tanks. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nIn a follow-up report last week citing recent satellite images, the Financial created_ats said six such vessels were being built at state-owned Guangzhou Shipyard International in southern China. \nMalcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, sad the barges were likely to be part of the PLA strategy on Taiwan. \n\"Certainly whilst these barges could be used to support other amphibious operations - for example to seize territory in the South China Sea - it is more likely they are being acquired to support the invasion of Taiwan,\" Davis said. \nBeijing regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring the self-governed island under its control. Most countries do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state but oppose any forcible attempt to change the status quo. \nWith a potential cross-strait conflict in mind, the PLA has been boosting its amphibious fleet. \nThe line-up includes the Type 075 amphibious assault ship, the Type 071 amphibious landing ship, and the next-generation amphibious assault ship unveiled last month known as the Type 076, which has an electromagnetic catapult. \nThe PLA is also making use of civilian vessels in its exercises, including a 10,000-tonne roll on-roll off passenger ferry that was part of a loading and crossing drill conducted by the 80th Group Army in August. \nBut an amphibious landing operation across the Taiwan Strait - which is some 160km (100 miles) wide at its narrowest point - would be complex and challenging. \nThere are only about 20 beaches in northern and western Taiwan that would be suitable for a PLA landing, according to a report last year by Taiwanese think tank the Institute for National Defence and Security Research. It also said the PLA did not have enough amphibious transport vehicles for the task. \nHowever, the new barges could be used to support the PLA's amphibious forces so that heavily defended beaches can be bypassed or to carry out landings in different locations, according to analysts. \nDavis said the barges would allow the PLA to rapidly deploy ground forces to the shoreline so that they can secure a beachhead, and the barges could then provide a form of offshore logistics support. \nHe said the barges were reportedly designed not just to get troops ashore but further inland onto road networks, giving landing forces fast mobility so that they do not get stuck on a beach under fire. \nLu Li-shih, a former instructor at the Taiwanese Naval Academy in Kaohsiung, also said the barges would allow for \"faster landings\" and reduce the created_at needed to clear obstacles set up to defend against attack. \nTimothy Heath, a senior international defence researcher with Rand Corporation, said during a landing operation in Taiwan the ships could also help offload equipment at ports and harbours destroyed either through combat or sabotage. \n\"However, the barges are also slow-moving targets and could be quite easily destroyed in a war, undermining their utility,\" he said, adding that for this reason he was sceptical that they were being built for a Taiwan attack. \nHeath also said that the construction of the barges did not point to an imminent plan to attack Taiwan in the absence of any other clear indicators. \n\"More likely, they are dual-use platforms that are designed primarily to support at sea commercial activity but which could also be used for a variety of war and non-war missions if they are built to military specifications,\" he said. \nChinese military analyst Song Zhongping also said the barges were dual-purpose and could be used for disaster relief as well as amphibious operations, including in the South China Sea or Taiwan. \n\"For military use, they could quickly facilitate the final few hundred metres of an amphibious landing,\" he said. \"By using an extended bridge to rapidly offload equipment such as tanks it would significantly reduce the losses that could occur in the final stretch of a landing.\" \nCollin Koh, a senior fellow with the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, agreed that the barges appeared to be designed for Taiwan. \nBut he said they would be vulnerable as they traversed the Taiwan Strait given their lack of self-defence capabilities. \n\"The voyage could be made perilous if Taiwanese forces and allies are not lying idle ... and if [the barges] don't have adequate naval and air cover they'll become sitting ducks that could easily be taken out,\" Koh said. \nCopyright (c) 2025.

Diehl, who also served as the 35th Director of the U.S. Mint, shares his thoughts on geopolitical risk - including ways physical gold can help hedge a portfolio against it - in an edition of ' Market Insider,' U.S. Money Reserve's review of current market conditions available on the company's website and YouTube channel.Historically, warfare is one of the factors that has helped drive gold prices - an outcome we've seen in the past year, Diehl says, as the issues occurring in the Middle East spread from Gaza and Israel to the West Bank, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and eventually Lebanon and Iran.'Other nations are now being drawn into the conflict - the U.S., our European allies, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Turkey,' Diehl says.'It is no exaggeration to say [that] these are dangerous developments.'Growing Geographic Concerns\nThe warfare in the Middle East isn't the only conflict  impacting gold prices, according to Diehl.Other major disputes generating gold demand include Russia's war with Ukraine, which has also led to other nations along its western border preparing to defend themselves, and rising tensions between China and Taiwan.'Chinese President Xi [Jinping] has ordered his military to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027,' Diehl says.'In the meancreated_at, he is deepening military cooperation with Russia and Iran while ramping up conflict with nations bordering the South China Sea.'The Chinese economy, Diehl says, is suffering and poses the risk of Xi becoming tempted to wage war to distract citizens from their financial situations.Military conflict that occurs outside of the United States can impact numerous domestic economic elements, such as defense spending, which the U.S. government has already increased.Diehl anticipates the pace of increased defense spending will likely accelerate, which could boost the economy and create jobs - and possibly raise  inflation rates.'Western sanctions on Russia led to a sharp increase in energy prices, juicing inflation for American consumers,' Diehl says.'But sanctions also generated windfall profits and jobs for U.S. oil and gas producers, downstream operators, and liquid natural gas suppliers to Europe.'Before the Russia-Ukraine war, Ukraine was a major agricultural product exporter.As shipments declined after the Russian invasion and U.S. and global inflation rates rose, U.S. agricultural suppliers benefited from higher prices.Similarly, Diehl says, with much of the world's oil sourced from the Middle East, expectations of a wider war in the region contributed to oil prices increasing by more than 5%.According to the U.S. Money Reserve President, tensions between the United States and China are now having a notable effect on our economy.The U.S. is onshoring the production of a number of manufactured and strategic commodities that were previously imported from China, which, while raising costs, is also creating American jobs and helping to protect national security.'The impact of these conflicts is complex - except for when it comes to gold,' Diehl says.'You can look back over the last year and see the proof.When rumors of war, fears of war, or outright warfare have risen, gold follows suit.'Recommended for you\nLink to the original story.N"

However, a Japanese official revealed that North Korea was on the agenda.\n Rubio, a former Florida senator, has taken a hard-line approach to China that aligns with Trump's stance. In his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, he said China is \"the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary\" the United States has ever confronted.\n Arriving at the State Department for his first day ahead of the meeting, Rubio delivered remarks in which he reminded officials that voters decide the course of the United States and they have elected Trump.\n \"Our foreign policy is centered on one thing, and that is the advancement of our national interest,\" Rubio said, telling them also that \"there will be changes\" in the way the department operates, but such moves were not meant to be \"destructive\" or \"punitive.\"\n He stressed that the department needs \"to move faster than we ever have, because the world is changing faster than we ever have.\"\n The diplomatic partnership of the four democracies was raised to the foreign ministerial level in 2019, during Trump's first presidency.\n His predecessor Joe Biden elevated the Quad to the leader level in 2021 and hosted the first in-person Quad summit in September of that year in Washington.\n Iwaya told reporters Tuesday night at a Washington hotel that Rubio organizing the meeting just after Trump returned to the White House on Monday meant the new administration places special value on the four-way partnership.\n The Quad's origins date back to when the four countries coordinated their emergency responses and humanitarian aid following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.\n Although the Quad is not a security alliance, it has often been regarded as a counterweight to China's growing influence. Its areas of cooperation have been expanding in recent years, ranging from maricreated_at security and infrastructure to health protection and emerging technologies.\n The four countries have repeatedly underscored that they have come together to spread values such as democratic governance and the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, but China has criticized the Quad as an Asian version of NATO aimed at containing its growing influence.\n Biden hosted a Quad summit last September in his home state of Delaware, at which the leaders used some of the strongest language ever issued by the group. Without mentioning China by name, they voiced \"serious concern\" over \"the militarization of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating maneuvers in the South China Sea.\"\n \"We condemn the dangerous use of coast guard and maricreated_at militia vessels, including increasing use of dangerous maneuvers,\" they said.\n Notable new initiatives announced at the created_at included the launching of joint coast guard exercises. The move was seen as augmenting the security aspect of the Quad and sending a strong signal to China that its assertive maricreated_at actions against smaller countries such as the Philippines were unacceptable.\n==Kyodo\n"

Samuel J. Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, was in attendance as well.\nThe U.S. Army displayed a Stryker 8x8 armored vehicle and M777A2 towed howitzer, whereas the U.S. Air Force dispatched two A-10C Thunderbolt II aircraft from a South Korean base, and a C-130J Super Hercules from Japan.\nThe government of Vietnam has shown interest in the Hercules to plug gaping holes in its air transportation capability. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson told Defense News that the company was highlighting the “C-130J’s tactical-by-design” capabilities at VIDEX 2024.\nThe spokesperson added, “Lockheed Martin stands ready to support Vietnam and other U.S. partners and allies across the Indo-Pacific region in meeting their current and future mission requirements across all domains.”\nA Vietnamese deal for C-130Js is not unrealistic, as Vietnam has already procured a dozen T-6C Texan II trainer aircraft from American firm Textron. Five T-6Cs were delivered last November, and the remainder will follow this year.\nWashington annulled a weapon sales ban to the Southeast Asian country in 2016, and a comprehensive strategic partnership signed during President Joe Biden’s visit to Vietnam in 2023 is paving the way for even more deals.\nMarc Knapper, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam, said at the show: “Our goal is to ensure that Vietnam has what it needs to defend its interests at sea, in the air, on the ground and in cyberspace.”\nKnapper continued, “This is why we came out in force in a truly historic, unprecedented participation by the United States government and private sector in this event, and it reflects our commitment to Vietnam and to Vietnam’s aspirations.”\nBoeing executive Dale McDowall told Defense News that his company’s presence at VIDEX 2024 was all about building relations with Vietnam.\nMcDowall said Boeing understands that maricreated_at security is critical to Vietnam, a country bordering the South China Sea. Boeing was thus promoting its Wave Glider unmanned surface vessel and ScanEagle drones.\nThe United States, under its Maricreated_at Security Initiative, supplied six ScanEagle systems to the Vietnam Coast Guard in 2022.\nAlso, because many parts of Vietnam are inaccessible and lack airstrips, McDowall said transport helicopters like the CH-47F Chinook “have huge potential” there.\nElsewhere, Natasha Pheiffer, BAE Systems’ managing director for Asia, said, “Vietnam is a new market for us.” She added, “We really are just exploring at the moment. There are no hard and fast opportunities for us per se,” though the company was supporting the U.S. government’s promotion of the M777 howitzer.\nWorking with Vietnam presents challenges too. “There isn’t a fixed procurement program, necessarily, which does make it a little more difficult to understand what it is they’re looking for,” Pheiffer noted.\nUnsurprisingly, Russia had a very visible presence at VIDEX 2024, with large exhibition booths and several vehicles on display, including a BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicle and Rubezh coastal missile system.\nAlso out in force showing their wares at Vietnam’s blue-ribbon defense show were the Czech Republic, India, Iran, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Such a diverse list is an indication of Vietnam’s efforts to diplomatically balance relations with competing powers.\nHowever, both Russian and Western suppliers must also contend with up-and-coming defense companies from Vietnam itself. Viettel, owned by the Ministry of National Defense, is Vietnam’s largest defense company.\nViettel was the most prominent exhibitor at VIDEX 2024, and it is now moving into the production of kinetic weapons. An example is the VCS-01 Truong Son coastal defense missile system now operational in the Vietnamese Navy. The VCS-01 system fires the VSM-01A missile possessing a 50-mile (80km) range.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-22",
    "text": "\nOn his first full day as secretary of State, Marco Rubio met Tuesday with his counterparts from a group of countries known as the Quad, which is made up of the United States, India, Japan and Australia, representing nearly 2 billion people and more than a third of global gross domestic product. The grouping has been around for 18 years but has recently grown in importance. What exactly is it?\n--\nA diplomatic partnership, but maybe more\nThe Quad was established in 2007 to bring together countries that had worked together in response to the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Its members stress its diplomatic nature and broad focus on regional issues, including infrastructure, humanitarian aid, disaster relief, climate change and maricreated_at security.\nEven though security is only part of the mix, the Quad is a major component of the American strategy to counter China's growing assertiveness and vast territorial claims in the region, including to virtually all of the strategically important South China Sea and the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan. As a result, the group is frequently referred to as the \"Quadrilateral Security Dialogue\" though officially it's just the Quad.\nThe strategic element to the Quad has prompted China to accuse the four countries of attempting to form an \"Asian NATO,\" though it is a very different construction and has no mutual-defense pact, a key component of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance.\nStill, after a Quad summit in September, the White House stressed that the members were working with partners throughout the region to \"bolster maricreated_at security, improve maricreated_at domain awareness, and uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"\n--\nHow important is it?\nNot long after its founding, the Quad fell dormant and stayed that way for a decade until President Trump in his first term agreed with the leaders of Japan, Australia and India to revive it.\nThe meetings of the countries' top diplomats were elevated under Joe Biden's presidency to summits of leaders, most recently in September in Biden's home state of Delaware. Over Biden's four years in office, defense cooperation among the Quad members has deepened. Japan, Australia and the U.S. have all increased their defense spending, with the Americans increasingly targeting the Asia-Pacific region, while India has held its expenditure steady.\nAt the Delaware summit, the countries agreed to expand the partnership among their coast guards to improve interoperability and capabilities, with Indian, Japanese and Australian personnel sailing on U.S. ships in the region.\nJapan and Australia have also been broadly revamping their defense strategies, with Australia entering the AUKUS agreement with the U.S. and United Kingdom to obtain nuclear-powered submarines and other advanced capabilities.\n--\nWhat comes next?\nIt remains to be seen whether Trump will keep the Quad at the leaders level, or turn it back to the nations' top diplomats, though the fact that there will be a meeting in Washington the day after his inauguration signals it's likely to remain important.\nFor his part, Rubio called China \"the most potent, dangerous and near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted\" during his confirmation hearing Wednesday, and the issues that gave rise to the rebirth of the Quad in Trump's first term have only intensified.\nAmong other things, China has been pursuing its regional territorial claims more aggressively, leading to direct confrontations with the Philippines and others, and working toward establishing a true \"blue-water\" navy capable of operating in seas far from China, including advancing toward the construction of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, in a growing global challenge.\nAhead of the meeting with Rubio, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong called bilateral ties with the U.S. \"our most important strategic relationship\" and said she was happy a meeting of the Quad countries was being held so soon after the inauguration.\n\"It's a demonstration of the collective commitment of all countries to the Quad, an ironclad commitment in this created_at where close cooperation in the Indo-Pacific is so important,\" she told reporters in Washington over the weekend.\n\nGraphic\n \nPHOTO: SECRETARY of State Marco Rubio, second from right, met with Japan's Takeshi Iwaya, left, India's Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Australia's Penny Wong.

    "text": "\n U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio agreed Tuesday with his counterparts from Japan, Australia and India to strengthen a free and open Indo-Pacific, just hours after he was sworn in as Washington's top diplomat.\n Following a meeting of the grouping known as the Quad, the four foreign ministers released a joint statement saying that \"the rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty, and territorial integrity\" should be upheld in the region, where China is increasingly seen as engaging in assertive behavior.\n The meeting in Washington was the first major diplomatic event of the second presidency of Donald Trump, a day after his inauguration.\n Rubio's discussions of key challenges in the Indo-Pacific with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar could signal that the Trump administration will be more supportive of multilateral cooperation than generally expected.\n Iwaya told reporters that \"it was very meaningful\" that Rubio's debut meeting was a Quad gathering and that the first joint statement of the new U.S. administration was released by the four countries.\n Iwaya said he believes the new administration places special value on the four-way partnership, noting that they agreed to meet together on a regular basis and prepare for the next summit to be hosted by India.\n The statement said the four countries \"strongly oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion\" and remain committed to reinforcing \"regional maricreated_at, economic and technology security in the face of increasing threats.\"\n It did not single out any country. However, a Japanese official revealed that North Korea was on the agenda.\n The official disclosed their discussions covered the nuclear issue but added that Rubio did not characterize North Korea as a \"nuclear power,\" when asked.\n On Monday, Trump had described North Korea as a \"nuclear power\" and said he believes the country's leader Kim Jong Un should be happy to see his return as \"we got along very well\" during the U.S. president's first term.\n It was unclear if his description of North Korea marked any departure from Washington's long-held position of not officially recognizing the country as a nuclear weapons state and aiming for its complete denuclearization.\n Rubio, a former Florida senator, has taken a hard-line approach to China that aligns with Trump's stance. In his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, he said China is \"the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary\" the United States has ever confronted.\n Arriving at the State Department for his first day ahead of the meeting, Rubio delivered remarks in which he reminded officials that voters decide the course of the United States and they have elected Trump.\n \"Our foreign policy is centered on one thing, and that is the advancement of our national interest,\" Rubio said, telling them also that \"there will be changes\" in the way the department operates, but such moves were not meant to be \"destructive\" or \"punitive.\"\n He stressed that the department needs \"to move faster than we ever have, because the world is changing faster than we ever have.\"\n The Quad was raised to the foreign ministerial level in 2019, during Trump's first presidency.\n His predecessor Joe Biden elevated the diplomatic partnership of the four democracies to the leader level in 2021 and hosted the first in-person Quad summit in September of that year in Washington.\n The Quad's origins date back to when the four countries coordinated their emergency responses and humanitarian aid following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.\n Although the Quad is not a security alliance, it has often been regarded as a counterweight to China's growing influence. Its areas of cooperation have been expanding in recent years, ranging from maricreated_at security and infrastructure to health protection and emerging technologies.\n The four countries have repeatedly underscored that they have come together to spread values such as democratic governance and the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, but China has criticized the Quad as an Asian version of NATO aimed at containing its growing influence.\n Biden hosted a Quad summit last September in his home state of Delaware, at which the leaders used some of the strongest language ever issued by the group. Without mentioning China by name, they voiced \"serious concern\" over \"the militarization of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating maneuvers in the South China Sea.\"\n \"We condemn the dangerous use of coast guard and maricreated_at militia vessels, including increasing use of dangerous maneuvers,\" they said.\n Notable new initiatives announced at the created_at included the launching of joint coast guard exercises. The move was seen as augmenting the security aspect of the Quad and sending a strong signal to China that its assertive maricreated_at actions against smaller countries such as the Philippines were unacceptable.\n==Kyodo\n"

CNOOC Limited Vice Chairman and CEO, Mr Zhou Xinhuai; President, Mr Yan Hongtao; General Manager of Finance Department, Ms Wang Xin.\nToday's briefing will be divided into two parts. First, our finance department, Ms Wang will present to you cn's 2025 strategy preview followed by a Q&A session for the Q&A session. There will be consecutive interpretations. Now I will pass the floor to Ms Wang.\nWANG XIN, GENERAL MANAGER - FINANCE, CNOOC LTD: Investors, analysts, media friends. Good afternoon. Welcome to Sea Limited 2025 strategy preview briefing as the stand line is just around the corner. I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a happy new year and all health are the best and a prosperous year of the snake. Before we begin. Please review the disclaimer next page please.\nToday's presentation is divided into two parts. The first is the company's operating guidance for 2025 and the second part is outlook for the future. Now, let's take a look at our company's key operating plans and targets for 2025 let's look at the macro environment first. The global economy is expected to grow by 3.2% in 2025.\nAnd China's economy is expected to grow by 5%. According to the forecast of major organizations, global oil demand will continue to rise steadily in the next few years and Brent oil price will remain at 70 to 80 us D per barrel. Overall macro environment is favorable for us to continue to consolidate our strengths and drive our high quality development based on current macro environment and the actual situation of the company and adhering to concept high quality development, we have set out our operation targets for 2025 1st. Let me share with you some key indicators. CapEx RMB125 billion to RMB135 billion.\nSo this is basically the same as 2024 production target would be 760 to 780 million BoEs. This will be a historical high level. Reserve replacement ratio won't be less than 130%. We'll continue to maintain good health safety and environment performance. Next, I will elaborate on the above.\nCapEx for 2024 was well implemented and is expected to reach about RMB132 billion the basis of supporting stable production growth. CapEx budget for 2025 will remain stable at RMB125 billion to RMB135 billion.\nOf which exploration development and production capitalization accounts for 16% 61% and 20% percent respectively. China and overseas capital expenditures accounted for 68% and 22% respectively. Exploration is the leading business of the company in 2025. We'll focus on searching for mid to large sized oil and gas fuels continue to consolidate resource base for reserves and production growth and promote medium and long term sustainable development. Through high quality exploration, we adhere to exploration plan of stabilizing oil and increasing gas and put more weight on gas stabilizing the Bohai accelerating South China Sea, expanding East China Sea and exploring Yellow Sea and strengthening overseas.\nAt the same created_at, we'll advance unconventional oil and gas exploration this year, we will continue to maintain a high level of exploration workload in China to help increase reserves and production efficiently in China. We maintain reasonable exploration investment to ensure stable crude oil reserve. We'll focus on shallow to middle play, deep water and delay and implement exploration deployments in high and South China Sea in an orderly manner focusing on new areas and fuels.\nWe will continue to strengthen natural gas exploration and deployment. Expanding the scale of exploration based on the trillion dollar atmospheric zone in the South China, focusing on shallow to middle and deep play, focusing on deep and ultra deep play exploration in Bohai and actively promoting synergistic exploration of tight gas and deep play coal bed me onshore overseas will continue to focus on deployment in countries on both sides of the Atlantic and along the Belt and Road.\nIn addition to continuing to promote drilling at Diana Project and rolling exploration at Theni project. As well as actively promoting new projects in Mozambique and Iran and other seismic exploration work will promote selection of new projects and strive to act as an operator for development investment. We will actively promote key projects at home and abroad.\nAt the same created_at, we will improve quality management of drilling and completion wells and control progress of projects to further increase production and efficiency. In terms of investment in production capitalization will continue to optimize deployment of adjusted wealth to increase production of individual wealth. Promote detailed description of oil and gas reservoir reserves to ensure stable production of oil and gas fuels promote implementation of key energy saving and decarbonization projects such as flare gas recovery.\nProduction volume is expected to reach about 720 million barrels -- million BOEs in 2024, achieving upper end of original target in 2025 we will maintain production growth with production target of 760 to 780 million BOEs. I will now introduce several key new projects this year 26 6 billion ton oil field in the central Boha has benefited from application of engineering standardization which has significant short term development cycle. Taking only three years from discovery to production.\nFirst phase of the field development project will have a peak production rate of about 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Main production facilities of Kenley 10 2 oil field cluster development project phase one located in Southern BHA consists of a central processing platform and two wellhead platforms with peak production rates of about 19,000 bo us per day.\nWeho 11 4 oil field adjustment and enclosed area development project located in South China Sea will integrate developments of new area and the secondary development of old oil field with peak production of about 17,000 BOEs per day py block. 1,011 joint development project in the eastern part of South China Sea with peak production capacity of about 14,000 eoe per day commenced production January 2nd this year, Shanghai won phase two gas development project in South China Sea with a peak production capacity of about 160 million cubic feet of natural gas and 3,900 barrels of condensate per day was commissioned in September last year and nine new wells will be commissioned in the project this year with additional production capacity of about 110 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.\nAs for new overseas projects. Yellowtail project in Guyana will start production within the year with capacity of 200 thou 250,000 BOE per day co owns a 25% interest in the project according to the operators disclosure. The star block where the project is located is expected to have eight phases of projects in operation by 2030 with total production growing to 1.3 million barrels per day and capacity reaching 1.7 million barrels per day.\nThe booze seven project in Brazil has a capacity of 225%. BOE Sso earns 7.34% interest in the project. The Boze field where the project is located is expected to have 11 phases in operation by 2027. With total production volume of 1.5 million BOE S per day and production capacity of more than 2 billion B 2 million BOE S per day.\nNow, let's take a look at the company's future outlook in the next few years. We'll continue to solidly push forward the three major programs of increasing reserve and production, scientific and technological innovation and green development and implement quality improvement efficiency enhancement. So as to continuously improve our value creation ability and brain return to shareholders. We focus on high quality development, pursue efficient production and maintain steady growth and scale with production targets of 700 to 800 million BOE S in 2026 and 810 to 830 million BOE S in 2027.\nWhile pursuing production growth, we'll continue to promote research and application of new technologies to increase oil and gas reserves and production including continuous research on key exploration and development technologies to promote construction of intelligent oil and gas fields and relying on the high energy A I model to promote deep integration of digital intelligence technology with oil and gas industry.\nAt the same created_at, we'll deepen engineering standardization and comprehensively promote construction of excellent and intelligent drilling and completion. While developing oil and gas, we also actively practice green development steadily develop shallow water wind power, continue to promote integrated development of onshore and offshore new energy sources and continuously improve level of green power substitution by utilizing onshore power projects.\nIn 2025 we expect to consume more than 1 billion kilowatt hour of green power. An increase of about 30% year on year promote industrialization of CCS CC US. Built two offshore CC US bases in Bohai and Hainan actively promote offshore CCS CC US demonstration projects in Daya Bay and Yangtze River delta and study formation of offshore CC US Industry Alliance.\nIn addition, we'll do a good job in carbon asset management and incorporate total amount of intensity of carbon emission into investment evaluation decisions in face of fluctuations in international oil price will continue to promote quality efficiency and upgrading actions, maintain stable CapEx in the future on the basis of supporting stable growth and production continue to implement stringent cost control to maintain industry leading cost competitiveness and adhere to prudent financial policies to maintain healthy financial position.\nThe company will as always attach great importance to ESG work insist on integrating ESG concepts into the company's development strategy and go system and strive to become a leading force in increasing oil and gas reserves and production. A facilitator of green and low carbon development and the backbone for building a harmonious society.\nYou can do that all along. We attach a lot of importance to shareholder return and we will share our results with shareholders in the long term, our cash dividend and also our dividend policy from 2022 to 24 has been well recognized by the market. So comparing the other companies, we have taken into consideration our present operating foundation, we have set our 2025 to 2027 dividend policy. So with the A GM dividend payout for the whole year will not be lower than 45%.\nSo we will make sure that we can pay back to shareholders and take into consideration shareholders which and also our strategic plan and we will make adjustments to our dividend policy. We will also consider market circumstances and within the consents of ATM, we will also do share buy back in the Hong Kong stock market.\nThat's all my presentation. Thank you.\nQuestions and Answers\nOPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)\nUNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (foreign language)\n(interpreted)\nThe first question is for the period 2022 to 2024. Well, we understand that the dividend absolute value was 70 Hong Kong cents per share. And I'm pleased to know that you are going to enhance your dividend payout ratio to 45%. However, this created_at, the absolute value of dividend has not been mentioned. So I would like to know what are your considerations behind this decision?\nOf course, I understand that you have to take into consideration the possible use of funds by your company and also CapEx calculation. And then the second question is about the Bohai Bay area. I would like to understand more about the future development and I believe that there will be a future regional growth potential in the area. So what are some specific plans or concrete measures that will be put in place in order to achieve regional growth around Bohai? Thank you.\nXINHUAI ZHOU, PRESIDENT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CNOOC LTD: (foreign language)\n(interpreted)\nNow let me answer the first question. Well, as said just now, this year, we have not mentioned the absolute value of dividend actually in the past cycle where usually the absolute value of dividends will not be provided. However, at that created_at, the market was at a very bad or poor condition. And there are also other reasons which are well known to all of us as a result, we had also withdrawn from the US. And at that created_at, we'd like to boost market confidence and get more support from investors.\nSo that's why with the approval from our board, we'd like to stabilize confidence. And so we provided an absolute value of dividend. Well, our company has been listed for 20-odd years already and all along, we have adhered to our principle and belief of making highly effective return to our shareholders. And based on that we make and also adjust our dividend policy as such. It is very important for our shareholders to be satisfied.\nAnd so as Ms Wang just mentioned, there are a basket of factors that we usually take into consideration in formulating our dividend policy, including the actual circumstances in the market shareholders wish and also our CapEx. So these are factors to consider and then with board approval, we will also make created_atly and appropriate adjustment to our dividend policy.\nAs regards to your second question? Well, MS Wang had said that in the coming three years. If oil price is normal, then we believe, well, we believe oil price will be in the range of around USD65 to USD85. Well, if that's the case, then we expect that we will have a rather big CapEx in the amount of [RMB100 billion to RMB135 billion]. So based on the long term oil price and also cash flow and also the our judgment in relation to oil demand and supply, then we will make adjustment and also we will come to a conclusion as regards to what should be done.\nSo in the past, there was a saying that for outstanding and excellent companies, they should be able to transcend both oil price cycle. So we will need to predict oil demand and also what the importance of oil in the energy mix is going to be like. So based on all these, we will formulate our mid to long term CapEx requirement and then we will definitely discuss with our investors as well. So as to come to a consensus and with all these inputs, we will be able to improve our operations and achieve high quality development.\nLet me answer your question about Bohai. Well, for co at least within the domestic market, in particular, Bohai is a very important crude oil production base for us and it is actually a very, very big cash cow for us as well. In the past, in the past years, in the past 40 years, we have been highly efficient and effective in our exploration and development. Basically, we have already formed a mutually connecting base including the onshore electricity business. So we'll continue to develop. So that as a result, the cost of development costs can come down.\nAt the same created_at, we also have to be effective and valuable in terms of arranging an overall stereoscopic exploration in the Bohai area by using such approaches and technique, then we can be more effective and more valuable. Now, at the same created_at, we have to pay attention to the 15th 5 year plan of our country. At the same created_at, we have to also look at our group company and the limited Company 15th 5-year plan in devising all the plans and actions.\nSo for Bohai oil and gas exploration and development plans, all these will be formulated in a scientific way. We understand that in the Bohai region, both oil and gas resources are very rich. There is all sorts of different resources available including condensate and also natural gas opportunities. So in Bohai oil field, we will continue to capitalize on our highly efficient and effective development work and we will further enhance our work by means of technological innovation and with the main exploration work leading our further development work, then we can ensure and also enhance sustainability of our shallow play exploration and development work.\nAt the same created_at, we will explore more into the mid to mid or mid high value added exploration work. So at the same created_at, we will also look into the deep play exploration and development. So all in all, we aim at developing a unified and an entire overall development and exploration strategy by doing all these, we can try our best to achieve progress in the midst of stability by means of highly effective development and also achieving low cost strategy and high return for our Bohai base.\nNow, Mr Yan is going to elaborate more because he is specializing in that particular region.\nHONGTAO YAN, VICE PRESIDENT, CNOOC LTD: (foreign language)\n(interpreted)\nLet me now supplement to what Mr Zhou just mentioned. So, in relation to our Bohai area, Bohai reserve is very rich. So recently, we have made new discovery in the deep play and also shallow play area. And we have confidence that we will be able to increase both reserve as well as production. And this is very beneficial in terms of our overall oil field development.\nAt the same created_at, we have made improvement and enhancement to our engineering work, our technology and management strategies and efficiency as well. So for example, the 266 oil field, we were able to make use of very good design and construction capabilities to shorten the overall lead, the overall construction lead created_at in the same year. Just now, we also mentioned the optimization of our drilling and completion wells, for instance, for our drilling wells, our efficiency is being enhanced by 20%.\nSo as a result, our CapEx situation can also benefit from such enhancement and inefficiency. And then for the old oil fields, they are the main bodies for our production and by achieving improvement in oilfield technology, even our working partners have commended us for the improvement and advancement that we have made. Well, actually, we find operation and management is something that we are indeed good at. So in the coming five to 10 years. We hope that we are able to enhance our, our extraction and recovery rates by 10% so that it can increase from the current 35% to 45%. So we don't need the same scale of new facilities and infrastructure construction in order to achieve the same results and outcome. So that's all I would like to supplement.\nOPERATOR: Okay. Thank you. All the questions are taken by Mr Zhou Xinhui, Vice Chairman CEO of the company and added by Mr Yan Hongtao, President of the company. (foreign language)\nNEIL BEVERIDGE, ANALYST, AB BERNSTEIN: Thank you very much Neil Beverage, Bernstein. Just a couple of questions. Production growth looks to be very good this year but guidance is a bit lower than last year. I think last year you guided to [780 to 800]. This year, you guided to [760 to 780]. I also noticed the CapEx guidance is a little bit lower also than last year. So are we seeing a delay in projects? Why is the guidance lower than last year? That's my first question. My second question is about the longer term CapEx guidance.\nYou know, for next year, your guidance is RMB125 billion to RMB135 billion. Should we expect CapEx to be, relatively flat for the next three years? If oil prices stay around 70 to $80 a barrel? And how much of your CapEx is dedicated to green low carbon development. The third question is really around share buybacks. You mentioned that right at the end of the presentation, CN is net cash. You're sitting on a lot of cash generating a lot of free cash flow, you could buy back a lot of your own stock. So what sort of guidance would you give the market in terms of, how much buybacks you're prepared to do? Thank you.\nXINHUAI ZHOU: (foreign language)\n(interpreted)\nLet me answer your last question first. Concerning share buyback. Of course, we will have to go according to the consent or approval by the AGM. At the same created_at, we have to look at our own shareholding structure. Our shareholding structure is different from companies like Exxonmobil, which is quite differentiated in these few years our CapEx was at a high level.\nHowever, we will not rule out the possibility or we will not negate the use of a share buyback as a tool all along. Well, a as you mentioned, we have good cash flow. We want to make sure that we have good cash flow in order to invest into good new projects and seize investment opportunities. We will have to seize good investment opportunities by referring to the oil price cycle. And at the same created_at, try our best to achieve high quality development.\nHere's my answer to your second question for our production volume guidance. Yes, the guidance is actually higher last year than this year. In these recent years, our production growth has been quite obvious and we have been very practical and we want to devise some very sound policies and strategies so as to achieve stability. So that's the basis that we come up with the guidance of 760 to 780.\nAnd as we have already disclosed, we have already made some disposal of some of the projects. And so as a result, production volume will come down, we have to be very prudent and practical in giving production guidance and estimates. So definitely we strive to increase our production volume and we also strive to improve our position in terms of cost and competition or competitiveness. So definitely we will believe that we will go for more production volume growth. And in these few years, in fact, production growth has been quite a lot already. So at this point in created_at, we need more sound and steady strategies in order to achieve our objective.\nThen concerning our investment guidance, I think just now an answer has already been given. But let me supplement in relation to green development and green investment regarding the guidance that we have given that is RMB125 billion to RMB135 billion. Well, that has not included a green investment or investment for green development.\nSo over the years, we have been capitalizing on our strengths and advantages offshore in our exploration work and we are trying our best to achieve integrated development of oil and gas and achieve technological innovation for further enhancement. And in this way, we will be able to achieve some substitution of existing energy resources by doing more decarboniation at the same created_at.\nIn relation to onshore power, we will tap this area to achieve replacement or substitution by green power or green electricity. And concerning the shallow water wind power again, we will be focusing in this area to give full play and capitalize on our wind power resources. But we will be doing this in a high in a method that is consistent with high standards.\nAnd also we would like to achieve scale and also high return in our wind power work. We will be very proactive in tying our work to make sure that it can meet our national as well as international standards as we all know in both our country and also in the international World Energy Transformation is something that won't change. So we will capitalize on our own advantages in the development of CCUS and CCS offshore reserves and we will wait till opportunities are ripe.\nSo if conditions and opportunities are right, then we can start the relevant work and then in the future, we will we believe that all our work will be conducive to the overall transformation so that everything will be progressing towards the right direction. Thank you.\nOPERATOR: Thank you. All. Questions are taken by Mr Zhou Xinhuai, the Vice Chairman, CEO of the company.\n(foreign language)\nUNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (foreign language)\n(interpreted)\nXINHUAI ZHOU: My first question is in relation to CapEx. So if oil price is going to stay stable, then in the coming three years, we believe that your CapEx will also be rather stable and in terms of production volume, it is going to be increased from 720 million BOEs to 810 million to even 830 million BOEs. So if your CapEx is going to stay flat, are you confident that you will be able to increase production volume as mentioned just now.\nAnd then the second question is, right now in China, the plan is to increase natural gas exploration as well as production. So can you give a guidance in relation to the breakdown between oil and gas?\n(foreign language)\nNow let me take the first question. I won't elaborate too much on CapEx structure. I would just answer the last point that you raised in that particular question that is, are we confident that we are able to achieve growth in production volume while CapEx is going to remain flat? Well, we have confidence because first of all, in the past years of our exploration and development work, we have already got some very significant especially overseas projects including the Brazil project and Diana project.\nAnd so we have a lot of confidence in relation to our knowledge and our understanding of the underground conditions. And we have also built a very advanced modeling technique and technology and we have also enhanced our production management capabilities a lot. So that's why we are able to become better in our intelligence work with the use of digital intelligence. And we are also very good at lowering or improving the amount of water concentration in our operations.\nSo all these are our strengths in particular with special reference to our technological and management capabilities. The second reason is our scale effects. So overall speaking, we are doing rolling and unified operations in our development work and as a result, marginal cost will come down. So that is also one advantage of our work.\nAnd thirdly, if you look at our Diana project, we have been working with our working partners to build some very good learning curve in terms of production volume target and also the growth in our reserves as well. So we have already formulated virtuous cycle. So we have confidence that we also have the ability that in the coming three years, we will be able to live up to the production volume guidance that we have already given. Of course, if there are major changes in oil price, then definitely at that created_at, we'll have to communicate with the market again.\nAnd definitely our core is to make sure that we can continue to sharpen our competitive advantage in terms of our low cost operation. We don't want to see only production volume growth with no efficiency. So more importance is being given to our competitive advantage. At the same created_at, we have to pay attention to our safety, environmental protection and ESG work. These are some very important fundamentals in our business development.\n(foreign language)\nWe are working very hard to enhance our natural gas production volume share in the overall production. However, we do not have the specific numbers to tell you. And in fact, it is not quite convenient for us to disclose those numbers regarding Bohai actually. Right now, it has already, it has been mentioned that we are focusing domestically in the three major Bay areas and the major region and we are enhancing our technological capabilities and our management efficiency.\nHoping that by doing all these our natural gas production volume share can rise and we are working very hard with our operators at Diana. We know that Diana is an area, especially at the Star Rock Lock is an area which is very rich in natural gas resources. So we will make use of our development work which is highly efficient and effective to enhance the overall production volume share of our overseas natural gas business.\nOPERATOR: Thank you. All questions are taken by Mr Zhou Xinghua, Vice Chairman, CEO of the company.\n(foreign language)\nUNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (foreign language)\n(interpreted)\nMy first question is that you have already disposed of your US projects. However, back then, you had not announced the gain from it. So is there some information that you can share? The second question is right now, President Trump had already assumed a position and well, he mentioned drill, baby drill. So do you find it a pity that you have already made an exit out of the US? And if you look at his energy policy, what kind of change or impact would it cause to the global crude oil market? And then the third question is Canada is going to be subject to higher tariffs. So again, what will be the impact on your business results?\nXINHUAI ZHOU: (foreign language)\nWell, first of all, we have to talk about the global asset, highly efficient and highly effective allocation in terms of global asset allocation. So, as you know, we have already made disposal and we have disclosed such disposal to the market already, but such disclosure is in accordance with market disclosure rules. So if you would like to get even further, more further details, we are not in a position, it is not convenient for us to disclose more.\nAnd regarding your second question about Trump 2.0 well, for sure, there will be bigger uncertainty that is going to be caused to the oil and gas market as well as energy market as a result of Trump's return to the US administration. And we believe that we have to adopt a critical thinking methodology in analyzing such impacts when it comes to offshore oil and gas development and exploration. Well, even though you are going to start building or erecting wells right now, it doesn't mean that you can immediately increase production volume next year.\nThat is definitely impossible. And as we know that us shale oil and gas production volume has been increasing steadily and they have been doing quite highly effective development and exploration. However, we know that the work or the business is basically taken up by traditional energy companies. And so they their work and their business and operations are really based on return on investment and return on assets. So we believe that this year for shale oil, the production volume may increase, but we don't foresee a big growth of that.\nAnd if you look at oil where there are a number of different attributes of oil, if it is being taken as an investment tool or as a capital operation tools, then that may lead to a big panic. Psychologically, at the same created_at, support will then be given to demand growth for our company. All along. We have been comparing ourselves with other companies, not based on absolute value, but we are comparing in terms of our own efforts and our hard work and also our own cost structure and cost advantage and our market competitiveness. So that's how we generate value for our shareholders.\nAnd then you also asked about whether or not there will be impact from tariff. Well, certainly there will be impact from tariff. However, the impact on our company will not be big. Thank you.\nOPERATOR: Thank you. All questions are taken by Mr Zhou Xinhui, Vice Chairman CEO of the company,\nLadies and gentlemen, because of created_at, we are going to conclude the Q&A session here. Thank you very much for joining. And at this point in created_at, I would like to take the opportunity to wish you all the best in the Chinese New Year.

    "created_at": "2025-01-22",
    "text": "\nExplore the key outcomes from the 2025 Quad Foreign Ministers' Meeting, the strategic role of India's Jaishankar, and the upcoming Quad Leaders' Summit in India. Learn about the Quad's commitment to maricreated_at security and Indo-Pacific stability.\nIn the days following President Donald Trump's inauguration for his second term, a significant diplomatic event unfolded in Washington, D.C., as the foreign ministers of the Quad nations-India, Australia, Japan, and the United States-convened for their first meeting under the new administration. This meeting marked an important step in the Quad's evolving strategic role, emphasizing the member states' shared commitment to regional stability and countering growing global challenges, particularly China's assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.\nJaishankar's Front Row Seat: Symbolism and Significance\nA striking moment during this meeting was India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar's position in the front row, sending a powerful message about India's increasing influence in global geopolitics. Jaishankar's prominent placement underscored India's strategic importance within the Quad and highlighted the growing diplomatic and security cooperation between India and the U.S.\nIn his post-meeting remarks, Jaishankar pointed out that the meeting's timing-just hours after Trump's inauguration-reinforced the priority Quad holds in the foreign policy of its member countries. He emphasized the need to deepen cooperation, expand the Quad's agenda beyond security concerns, and intensify collaboration on global issues such as maricreated_at security, technology governance, and economic resilience.\nStrengthening the Quad Amid Rising Tensions\nThe Quad, originally formed in 2007, has emerged as a critical platform for the four countries to address regional security concerns, particularly China's territorial ambitions in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. While some critics, notably China, claim that the Quad represents an \"Asian NATO,\" the Quad countries themselves stress that it is a diplomatic forum-not a military alliance-focused on regional stability and prosperity.\nThe U.S., represented by newly-appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, reiterated its commitment to working closely with its allies to ensure a \"Free and Open Indo-Pacific.\" The joint statement issued at the conclusion of the meeting highlighted the Quad's shared commitment to upholding the rule of law and territorial integrity across the region, sending a strong message to China as tensions in the Indo-Pacific grow.\nKey Takeaways from the Quad Foreign Ministers' Meeting\nA Strong Message on Regional Stability: The joint statement emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and reinforced the Quad's commitment to ensuring that no country can unilaterally change the region's status quo. This stance is particularly significant as territorial disputes with China intensify.\nDeepening Quad Cooperation: The Quad countries agreed to expand collaboration in several critical areas, including maricreated_at security, supply chain resilience, and technological partnerships. The ministers stressed the importance of making the Quad a more effective forum for addressing global challenges, signaling their intent to broaden the Quad's focus.\nIndia's Enhanced Diplomatic Profile: Jaishankar's prominent role in the meeting reflected India's growing influence on the global stage. His remarks underscored India's intention to help shape the Quad's future direction and its desire to collaborate more closely with the U.S. and other regional powers.\nThe Strategic Imperative of the Quad: Rubio's comments highlighted the Quad's strategic significance for the U.S. and its long-standing focus on countering China's rising influence. The meeting reaffirmed the Quad's importance in Washington's Indo-Pacific strategy.\nThe Road Ahead for Quad Cooperation: The Quad nations agreed to meet regularly in the coming months to prepare for the upcoming Quad Leaders' Summit in India. This summit will serve as a crucial platform to further solidify the Quad's vision and discuss its role in addressing key regional and global challenges.\nThe Upcoming Quad Leaders' Summit in India\nOne of the most eagerly anticipated outcomes of the renewed focus on the Quad is the upcoming Quad Leaders' Summit, which will be held in India later this year. This summit will provide an opportunity for the four leaders to deepen their cooperation and chart the future course for the Quad's diplomatic, economic, and security initiatives. While the exact date has yet to be finalized, the summit is expected to coincide with President Trump's visit to India, underscoring the growing strategic alignment between the two countries.\nIndia's role as host will be a significant diplomatic milestone, signaling its importance in the Quad and its broader Indo-Pacific strategy. The summit is likely to focus on strengthening maricreated_at security, expanding economic cooperation, enhancing technological collaboration, and addressing China's increasing influence. A central theme will be reinforcing the Quad's commitment to an inclusive, free, and open Indo-Pacific, where all countries can pursue prosperity without fear of coercion.\nThe Quad Coast Guard Drills: Enhancing Interoperability\nAn important area of focus during the ministerial meeting was the expansion of joint security initiatives, particularly the Quad Coast Guard drills. These drills aim to enhance interoperability among the Coast Guards of the four countries and improve their ability to respond to maricreated_at security challenges. The exercises focus on improving coordination in maricreated_at domain awareness, search and rescue operations, and protecting critical sea lanes.\nGiven the Indo-Pacific's vast maricreated_at trade routes and contested waters, the Quad nations have placed a high priority on ensuring freedom of navigation in the region. The Coast Guard drills serve as a demonstration of the Quad's commitment to maintaining regional stability and maricreated_at security. As tensions over territorial disputes and freedom of navigation continue to grow, these drills will likely expand in scope, solidifying the Quad's role as a key player in the Indo-Pacific's security architecture.\nThe Quad's Evolving Role in Global Diplomacy\nThe first Quad Foreign Ministers' Meeting under Trump 2.0 was a pivotal moment in the Quad's evolution, emphasizing its growing importance in shaping the future of the Indo-Pacific and its commitment to regional peace and stability. The meeting underscored the Quad's unity in responding to China's growing assertiveness and highlighted India's rising diplomatic stature on the global stage.\n"

    "text": "\nChina's relations are starting to improve with Japan, India and other countries that former U.S. President Joe Biden courted, just as Donald Trump brings his more unilateralist approach back to the White House.\nThe change of leadership in Washington on Monday could be an opportunity for China, which has long railed against Biden's strategy of building partnerships with \"like-minded countries\" to counter its growing influence.\nBiden reinvigorated a grouping known as the Quad — the United States, India, Japan and Australia. China's relations with all three of those U.S. partners are improving, as are its ties with Britain. The durability of Biden's legacy is now in question. During his first term, Trump didn't hesitate to challenge traditional U.S. partners.\n\"It is possible that Trump may drift away from U.S. allies, making them pay more attention to China's role, and in fact it has provided a chance for China's diplomacy,\" said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \"I think we should grasp the chance.\"\nBut U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said that Trump \"has a record of rallying the world toward a more competitive stance with China.\" Trump agreed to a Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy that Japan introduced during his first term and he backed excluding Chinese companies from telecom networks in the U.S. and many of its partners.\nOn Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio — hours after he was sworn in — met with the foreign ministers of Australia, India and Japan in Washington, a move that suggested engaging the Quad countries and countering China's influence will remain a priority for Trump.\nFence-mending with China has limits\nBeijing's rapprochement with the U.K. and Japan is in its early stages, and major differences remain that limit and could derail it.\nIndia turned the page with China on a bitter border dispute last October, but protested when Beijing created two new counties in an area claimed by both nations.\nStill, new leaders in Australia, the U.K. and Japan have shown a desire to warm relations with China, the world's largest manufacturer and a source of strategic minerals. The government in Beijing has reciprocated in part because it wants foreign investment to help revive its economy, which could be set back if Trump follows through on a threat to impose higher tariffs.\nChinese President Xi Jinping told European Council President Antonio Costa in a phone conversation last week that both sides could bring more \"stability and certainty\" to the turbulent global situation. China and Britain restarted economic and financial talks after a six-year hiatus when the U.K. Treasury chief visited Beijing this month.\n\"From China's point of view, improving relations with American allies and increasing economic cooperation will offset the shock to China-U.S. economic relations,\" Wu said.\nTrump's statements agitate U.S. allies\nIn Washington, there's a strong bipartisan consensus that the U.S. must prevail in its economic and tech rivalry with China to maintain its global leadership.\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Rubio called China \"the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.\" Biden kept the tariffs Trump levied on China and imposed more on Chinese electric cars and solar cells.\nBut unlike Biden, Trump has irked U.S. allies and partners with his recent remarks on possibly annexing Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and making Canada the 51st American state.\nHal Brands, senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank American Enterprise Institute, said he believes some top strategists in Beijing are \"salivating at the damage they think Trump is going to do to U.S. alliances and the opportunities this creates for Beijing to resurrect some of its relationships with ... Japan and Europe that had moved in a very sharply anti-China direction since COVID.\"\nTrump's rhetoric and attempts by adviser Elon Musk to interfere in British and German politics, \"are certain to have a ripple effect,\" said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center in Washington.\n\"Countries want to at the minimum keep their options open,\" she said. \"China is unlikely to be a better choice than the U.S., even under Trump, but it is important to find some counterbalance.\"\nThe Philippines isn't mending fences\nChina's relations aren't improving with every U.S. partner.\nThe Philippines complained recently about what it called a \"monster\" Chinese coast guard ship in nearby waters, and the foreign ministers of Japan and the Philippines said last week they would convey to Trump the urgent need for the U.S. to remain engaged in the region.\nChina and the Philippines did reach a temporary deal last July that has prevented further violent confrontations around Second Thomas Shoal, one of several outcroppings that both countries claim in the South China Sea.\nUncertainty about Trump's policies is prompting both China and Japan to seek a stable relationship, said Taizo Miyagi, an expert on Japanese diplomacy at Chuo University in Tokyo.\nA Japanese foreign minister has visited Beijing for the first created_at in seven years, and Chinese military officials were in Tokyo last week to resume defense exchanges after a five-year hiatus.\n\"In a way it is a Trump effect,\" Miyagi said. \"Many other countries are likely thinking the same and this could invigorate their diplomatic activities.\"\nBritain steers a new course with China\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer has sought to rebuild ties with Beijing since his Labour Party's election victory last summer. It's a marked shift from predecessor Rishi Sunak, who in 2022 declared an end to his country's \"golden era\" of friendship with China.\nIn Britain's case, Trump's return may not be driving the rapprochement.\nMany European leaders may not welcome Trump's America-first agenda, \"but the idea that as a result they will all kowtow to Beijing for more trade is fanciful thinking on the part of some of our Chinese friends,\" said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London.\nMost would prefer to remain partners with Washington. French President Emmanuel Macron, outlining his vision for global diplomacy in a New Year's speech, declared that his country was \"a solid ally\" of Trump.\nHe and others hope that Trump will respond positively to their outreach. Much will depend on what path the returning U.S. president takes, and how the rest of the world reacts.\n"

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:\nPeople's Daily: The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2025 is being held in Davos, Switzerland. The WEF is an important platform for discussions of global economic issues. Could you share with us China's propositions?\nMao Ning: Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Ding Xuexiang delivered a special address at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting. He shared four observations: first, jointly promote a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization; second, jointly uphold and practice true multilateralism; third, jointly foster new drivers and strengths for global economic development; fourth, jointly tackle major global challenges such as climate change, food security and energy security.\nVice Premier Ding Xuexiang stressed that economic globalization is an inherent requirement for the development of productive forces, and an inevitable result of technological advancement. It is not a \"you-lose-I-win\" zero-sum game, but a universally beneficial process where all can benefit and win together. Protectionism leads nowhere. Trade war has no winners. It's important to tackle the development challenges with universal benefit, and pool strengths with inclusive cooperation, so as to usher in a new phase of economic globalization that is more dynamic, more inclusive and more sustainable. We need to find a win-win and all-win solution, one that is based on mutually beneficial cooperation, and not only make the pie of economic globalization bigger, but also distribute it better.\nVice Premier Ding Xuexiang gave an overview of China's economy. He shared three major trends that characterize the Chinese economy: first, high-quality development is making solid progress; second, green and low-carbon transition is accelerating across the board; third, reform and opening up is moving up to a higher level. China will further intensify macro policies, continue high-quality development, effectively pursue higher-quality economic growth and appropriately increase economic output, and inject strong and sustained impetus to global economic development.\"\nChina News Service: In a press release on January 17, the US Department of Treasury announced sanctions against relevant Chinese company and citizen that were involved with Salt Typhoon's cyberattack. What's China's response?\nMao Ning: China opposes the accusations made by the Biden administration without any convincing evidence and their abuse of sanctions against China. In fact, the US has conducted large-scale and systemic cyberattacks on China for years. We have made very clear our concerns and opposition on this for many created_ats.\nWhen it comes to cyber issues, China and the US are countries with big influence. The two sides share similar concerns on safeguarding cybersecurity, especially the security of key infrastructure. It's important for the two countries to follow the principle of equality and mutual respect, frankly discuss issues of respective concerns on the basis of fact and evidence, observe the same international rules, and jointly keep the cyberspace peaceful and stable. The US needs to stop abusing sanctions.\nTASS: On Tuesday, President Donald Trump will levy tariff on Chinese exports to the US, with an expected start date of February 1. What is China's comment?\nMao Ning: We have made clear China's position on this issue multiple created_ats. We believe that there's no winner in a trade or tariff war, and we firmly uphold our national interests.\nGlobal created_ats: The Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation said they arrested a Chinese national and two Filipinos suspected of conducting espionage operations. Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief Romero Brawner Jr. said the Chinese spy was found near the US military bases in the Philippines, and Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said they would ensure an airtight case against the Chinese spy to uphold the Philippines' sovereignty and security. What's China's response?\nMao Ning: The Chinese government, as always, asks Chinese nationals overseas to abide by local laws and regulations. We hope the Philippines will stick to the fact, stop shadow-chasing, stop peddling the so-called \"Chinese spy,\" and earnestly protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese nationals in the Philippines.\nKyodo News: It was reported that foreign ministers of Japan and the US, as well as foreign ministers of Quad, met in Washington on January 21 to exchange views on issues including China's attempt to change the status quo in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. What is your comment on this?\nMao Ning: China believes that cooperation between countries should not target any third party. Engaging in group politics and bloc confrontation will not bring lasting peace and security, and is not conducive to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and the world as a whole. China's activities in relevant waters are lawful, legitimate and completely justified. We hope that relevant parties will do more things that help enhance mutual trust and cooperation between countries.\nThe New York created_ats: Has China changed the Chinese name that it uses for Secretary of State Rubio? If so, does that have a bearing on whether or not he's covered by China's sanctions?\nMao Ning: I am not yet aware of what you mentioned. If you ask me, instead of how his name is translated in Chinese, it's his actual name in English that is more important. On the sanctions, I want to say that my colleague made clear China's position yesterday. What I can tell you is that China's sanctions are aimed at the words and actions that harm China's legitimate rights and interests.\nAFP: The Thailand government today denied that it was planning to send 48 Uyghurs held in the country's detention centers back to China. These 48 people had fled China and were arrested in Thailand over a decade ago. Can the Foreign Ministry tell us if there are any plans with Thailand to receive these Uyghurs or give us any update?\nMao Ning: I'm not familiar with what you mentioned. More broadly, China's position on the issue of illegal immigration is consistent and clear. We resolutely fight activities of illegal immigration in any form and oppose any act of condoning or even supporting illegal immigration. China is a country under the rule of law and will properly handle relevant issue by strengthening international law enforcement and security cooperation.\nDragon TV: It's reported that on January 21, a fire at a hotel in Turkiye killed 76 people and injured 51. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a day of national mourning to be observed on January 22. What's China's comment?\nMao Ning: We share the grief over the fatal fire accident that took place in Turkiye's Bolu province yesterday. Our hearts go out to the victims and those who have lost their loved ones, and we wish those who were injured speedy recovery.\nAFP: There are some reports on social media of a Chinese national having been killed in an attack in north Afghanistan. These reports say that a Chinese worker in the mining industry was killed last night in Takhar province. Can the Foreign Ministry confirm or give us any details on this attack and this Chinese national?\nMao Ning: I'm not yet familiar with what you mentioned. I believe our Embassy in Afghanistan will track the information over what's happened, and do its utmost to protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese citizens and their safety.\nBloomberg: On TikTok. US President Donald Trump has said he would be open to Elon Musk or Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison purchasing social media app TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government. Does the Foreign Ministry have any comment on this? And how would China feel about the US government being part of a joint venture that splits the ownership of TikTok?\nMao Ning: On TikTok, my colleagues and I have repeatedly stated China's principled position over the past few days, and you may refer to that.\nReuters: Could you tell us more on how the strategic communication channel on major topics between China and the US works? Who from the China side is speaking to the US on this channel and from which arm of the Chinese government? And likewise, who is on the US end of this channel?\nMao Ning: We have no information to share at this created_at.\nAFP: With the threat of 10 percent tariffs, are there any talks happening already or any negotiations going on?\nMao Ning: What I can say is that we stand ready to maintain communication with the US, properly handle differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation and pursue a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-US relationship. China will also firmly defend its own interests.\nRT TV: Trump, shortly after being sworn in, threatens 100 percent tariffs on BRICS nations if they continue de-dollarization efforts. Do you have any response to this?\nMao Ning: As an important platform for cooperation among emerging markets and developing countries, BRICS advocates openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation, not bloc confrontation, and does not target any third party. The aim is to realize common development and prosperity. China stands ready to continue working with BRICS partners to deepen practical cooperation in various fields and make more contribution to the sustained and steady growth of the world economy.\nReuters: I just wanna follow up on the Thailand-Uyghur issue. The UN human rights experts released a statement yesterday urging Thailand to immediately stop the possible transfer of the 48 Uhghurs to China. In the statement, the UN warned, to quote the statement, that the group was at real risk of torture or other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment if they are returned. How does China respond to this statement?\nMao Ning: Judging by your question, this is a matter regarding the judicial cooperation between two sovereign states. UN experts, whatever their role is, should fulfill their mandate in a just and objective manner in line with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council, and make sure that nothing they say or do interferes in the judicial sovereignty of UN member states and their normal judicial cooperation, instead of speaking out irresponsibly on those matters.\"\nBloomberg: Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Tuesday with his Quad counterparts from Australia, India and Japan. I'm just wondering if the Foreign Ministry has any comments on the meeting.\nMao Ning: This question was raised by Kyoto News. I already gave an answer.\nNBC: I just want to know if you have a latest comment on the Panama Canal issue. President Trump warned of the danger of China taking control of the canal, and he would like to take it back from Panama. Do you have any comment on this?\"\nMao Ning: We agree with Panama's President Jose Ral Mulino that Panama's sovereignty and independence are not negotiable, and the Panama Canal is not under direct or indirect control by any power. China does not take part in managing or operating the Canal. Never ever has China interfered. We respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize it as a permanently neutral international waterway.\n"

    "text": "\n The US secretary of state opens his term by reaffirming Washington's commitment to the Philippines and other regional allies   \nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reaffirmed Washington's commitment to Manila and condemned Beijing for its \"dangerous and destabilising\" actions in the South China Sea, in his first phone call with Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo. \nRubio \"underscored the United States' ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our mutual defence treaty\", State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said. \nIn the phone call on Wednesday, they discussed \"issues of mutual concern\", including China's \"dangerous and destabilising actions in the South China Sea\", she said, adding that Rubio conveyed that Beijing's behaviour \"undermines regional peace and stability and is inconsistent with international law\". \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nCommenting on the phone call, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Thursday that China's activities in the relevant waters were legitimate, lawful and beyond reproach. \n\"The US is not a party to the South China Sea issue and has no right to interfere in the maricreated_at issues between China and the Philippines. The military cooperation between the US and Philippines should not undermine China's sovereignty, maricreated_at rights, and interests in the South China Sea, nor should it be used to support the illegal claims of the Philippines,\" Mao said. \nThe reported comments by the US secretary of state - which mark Rubio's first direct rebuke of China since taking office on Tuesday - were delivered against a backdrop of rising tensions in the waters between Beijing and Manila, Washington's oldest ally in Asia. \nThe Philippines has denounced the presence of China's coastguard vessels near Scarborough Shoal - the subject of competing claims by the two countries - while Beijing has accused Manila of \"hyping up\" disputes in the region. \nIn a further sign of rising tensions, the Chinese military held two days of combat readiness patrols in the South China Sea last week that coincided with the first bilateral maricreated_at exercises of the year between the Philippines and the United States. \nIn a social media post, Manalo said that he and Rubio talked about the importance of the alliance between Manila and Washington following President Donald Trump's return to the White House. \n\"We discussed the importance of the PH-US alliance for the prosperity and security of the Indo-Pacific, and the strength of our bilateral political, economic, and people-to-people ties,\" he said in the post. \nManalo added that Manila was ready to work with the new US administration \"towards addressing challenges and sustaining the momentum and positive trajectory in our bilateral relations\". \nRubio is a vocal critic of Beijing who has previously advocated for strong alliances to counter China. \nAs a Florida senator, he introduced a bill in July supporting Manila \"diplomatically, economically, and militarily as it resists Chinese efforts to seize Philippine territory in the South China Sea\". \nIn another move that could dismay Beijing, Rubio convened a meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with his counterparts from Japan, Australia and India on his first day in office, followed by bilateral talks with each of them. \nThe US-led Quad is regarded with caution by Beijing, as a pillar of Washington's network of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region that are aimed at countering China's influence in the region. \nIn a joint statement after the meeting, the diplomats did not refer directly to China but affirmed their \"strong opposition to any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion\". \nCommenting on Tuesday, Mao, from the Chinese foreign ministry, said: \"Engaging in bloc politics and confrontations between camps will not bring peace and security, and is detrimental to the stability of the Asia-Pacific and the world.\" \nCopyright (c) 2025.

The United States is not a party to the issue and has no right to intervene,\" Mao Ning, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, told a press conference.\nThese statements are in response to comments by the new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who criticized Beijing's actions in these waters as \"dangerous and destabilizing.\"\nMao defended her country's position, noting that Chinese claims are backed by international law and that any military collaboration between the U.S. and the Philippines \"must not prejudice China's sovereignty or maricreated_at rights in the region, nor serve as support for the Philippines' illegal claims.\"\nThe spokeswoman also condemned the deployment of intermediate-range missiles in the Philippines, a decision she described as \"highly dangerous.\"\n\"I want to emphasize that the introduction of strategic offensive missile systems in the Philippines increases regional tensions, provokes geopolitical conflicts and an arms race, and represents an extremely irresponsible choice for the people of the Philippines and Southeast Asia,\" the spokeswoman said.\nChina urged the Philippine government to \"correct its wrong decisions\" and fulfill its commitment to withdraw the Typhoon missile system \"as soon as possible.\"\nDonald Trump's return to the White House has raised concerns in Asia about his future policies toward the region. However, the Philippines has been hopeful that Washington will continue to back him amid its growing tensions with China.\nManila and Beijing have disputes over sovereignty in the South China Sea, which carries about 30% of global trade and is home to 12% of the world's fishing grounds, as well as potential oil and gas fields.\nThese tensions have been on the rise in recent years, coinciding with the coming to power of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in 2022. The Philippines has since become more assertive in defending its territory against China, which claims almost all of the waters.\nThe main risk is that this region could become the scene of a potential conflict between Beijing and Washington, because although the United States does not have any direct sovereignty dispute, it maintains a mutual defense pact with the Philippines.\n"

However, upon its arrival, another Chinese Coast Guard vessel, No. 3304, approached the areas.\n\"This indicates that the CCG may anticipate the PCG deploying two vessels in response,\" Tarriela said, adding that the second Chinese ship pulled back after the Suluan made its scheduled return to port.\n\"Currently, BRP Cabra is engaged in hourly radio communications with CCG-3103 to remind them of their violations of the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea), and the 2016 arbitral award,\" Tarriela stated.\nThe spokesperson was referring to a Hague-based international arbitral court's 2016 decision largely siding with the Philippines and rejecting China's sweeping claims over most of the South China Sea. Beijing refused to take part in the proceedings and maintains the decision is invalid.\nWhat People Are Saying\nChinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters Wednesday:\n\"China's activities in relevant waters are lawful, legitimate and completely justified. We hope that relevant parties will do more things that help enhance mutual trust and cooperation between countries.\"\nHu Bo, director of Peking University's Center for Maricreated_at Strategy Studies and of the Beijing-based South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI) think tank, said:\n\"Whether in terms of operational capacity or determination, the Philippines is likely the weakest among the South China Sea parties [ …] Unless the U.S. directly intervenes to help, there is a ceiling on its ability for on-site infringements and provocations in the region, limiting the potential for major incidents and presenting more of a challenge in gray zone competition.\"\nWhat's Next?\nWith an eye toward China, former President Joe Biden and Philippine counterpart Ferdinand Marcos Jr. further strengthened strategic ties, with Washington committing hundreds of millions of dollars in security aid and Manila expanding U.S. military access to more of its bases.\nHu, the Chinese maricreated_at analyst, wrote in a recent article for SCSPI that President Donald Trump had a distaste for the system of alliances favored by the U.S. establishment, predicting the new president would not likely \"respect the demands of allies like the Philippines.\"\nHowever, the Trump administration has signaled it will continue Biden's strong multilateral engagement in the region.\nDuring his second day as secretary of state Wednesday, Marco Rubio discussed the South China Sea issues with his Philippine counterpart, Enrique Manalo. Rubio said China's behavior undermines peace and stability in the region and reiterated Washington's support for its \"ironclad\" Mutual Defense Treaty with Manila, the State Department said in a statement.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nChina Coast Guard Occupies Philippine Maricreated_at Zone\nPhilippine Coast Guard\nChina Coast Guard Occupies Philippine Maricreated_at Zone\n"

    "text": "\nFORTUNE: As Trump returns to the White House with new threats against China, Singapore's leader thinks that a full split between Washington and Beijing is unlikely, yet warns that disaster looms if the two sides can't get along—and drag the rest of the world along with them.\nAt an event at the National University of Singapore on Tuesday, Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong was asked what Trump's second term meant for the region. According to the Straits created_ats, a local newspaper, Wong suggested that while the U.S. and China were competing for global leadership, neither Washington nor Beijing wanted a hot war.\nYet he warned that countries like Singapore should not be forced to take sides, joining either a U.S. bloc or a China bloc. A move like that could \"take the world to the brink of a third world war,\" he said.\nFortune has reached out to the Prime Minister's Office for additional comment.\nMiscalculations could also happen around geopolitical hotspots like the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait, Wong added.\nBeijing claims almost all the South China Sea, leading to territorial disputes with Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines and Vietnam. In recent years, China has tried to buttress its claims by building artificial islands or harassing ships from competing nations.\nWashington often criticizes China's actions in the South China Sea, especially those toward the Philippines, a U.S. ally. The U.S. Navy conducts frequent freedom of navigation exercises through the South China Sea as well, to Beijing's disapproval.\nSoutheast Asian countries have, for the most part, tried to maintain good relations with both the U.S. and China, sticking to a policy of nonalignment. Several countries in the region maintain strong security ties with Washington, yet China is the region's largest trading partner.\nDespite his warning, Wong said on Tuesday that he felt it was unlikely that relations between the U.S. and China would get so bad as to spark a \"third world war.\"\n\"If the U.S. were to cut themselves off from China, it will be very damaging for the U.S. economy and for American citizens. So much of what the U.S. manufactures and produces and imports for its people comes from China, so I can't see how a full decoupling can happen at this stage,\" Mothership.sg, another local outlet, reported Wong saying.\nOn Tuesday, Trump raised the possibility of a new 10% tariff on Chinese goods as early as Feb. 1, which would be the first move in a likely renewed trade war between the U.S. and China. On Wednesday, Chinese officials reiterated that \"there are no winners in a trade or tariff war.\"\nGlobal companies continue to rely on China for their supply chains. Experts note that China is still the only country that can manufacture intricate products, like motherboards and electronics, at scale and at low cost. U.S. retailers also rely on China for cheap imports.\nLink to Image\n"

    "text": "\n Observers welcome Rubio's statements that they say indicate continuity in US policy and 'more robust support' for Manila in South China Sea row   \nThe new US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's assurance of an \"ironclad commitment\" to its oldest military ally in Asia, the Philippines, was welcomed on Thursday by analysts, but they suggested this would all depend on US President Donald Trump, who appeared to have softened his stance on China. \nIn one of his first acts as the country's chief implementer of Trump's foreign policy, Rubio phoned Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo on Wednesday to \"underscore\" Washington's \"ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defence Treaty [MDT]\", according to state department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce. \nRubio and Manalo talked about \"issues of mutual concern, including [China's] dangerous and destabilising actions in the South China Sea\", Bruce disclosed, adding that Rubio had said Beijing's behaviour \"undermines regional peace and stability and is inconsistent with international law\". \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nBruce made no mention of the two discussing the trilateral security arrangement among the US, Japan and the Philippines, which was a last-minute initiative of former US president Joe Biden. \nEarlier, Rubio also met his fellow foreign ministers of the Quad - Australia, India and Japan - and the officials in a joint statement said they \"strongly oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion in the Indo-Pacific region\". \nRaymond Powell, a former US Air Force colonel and director of the SeaLight project that tracks China's activities against the Philippines, welcomed Rubio's statements. \n\"Secretary Rubio's statement conveys continuity of US foreign policy towards the Philippines and the South China Sea from the previous administration,\" Powell told This Week in Asia. \n\"That signals that under Trump the US will provide even more robust support to the Philippines in its dispute with China,\" Antonio Carpio, a retired Supreme Court justice who has made the South China Sea dispute his advocacy, also said. \nCollin Koh, a senior fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, joked on X that he had \"been hearing this standard template 'ironclad' mention every now and then. The thing is, if it must sound like iron, it has to feel like iron\". \nIn a response to his post, Koh added: \"As a materials engineer by initial training, I must say you can certainly put additives to iron to make it less prone to rust!\" \nKoh told This Week in Asia that his X post was a \"tongue-in-cheek comment\", but pointed out there were concerns in both the Philippines and the global community about whether the US would actually commit to the MDT should conflict break out in the West Philippine Sea - Manila's name for part of the disputed South China Sea it considers its maricreated_at territory. \n\"That's also the key reason why Manila policy elites are exploring alternatives with other friendly regional and extra-regional partners,\" he said. \nNoted sociology professor Walden Bello cautioned that Rubio's statements \"could be a negotiating move\" on the part of Trump. \n\"You cannot assume that the statements of Trump subordinates are Trump's views,\" said Bello, who co-chairs the Focus on the Global South institute in Bangkok. \nBello pointed out that Rubio himself had recently backtracked on the statements he had made in February 2021. Rubio, then a senator, had slammed the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by a mob of pro-Trump supporters as a \"national embarrassment\" which \"affect our standing in the world\". \nShortly before being confirmed as secretary of state on Monday, Rubio said his personal circumstances had changed as he now worked for Trump, \"who has a clear mandate to reorient our foreign policy to one that once again puts America and our interests at the centre. And that's what I'm going to focus on, 100 per cent\". \nBello told This Week in Asia that Rubio's change of heart showed \"the views of Trump's subordinates are malleable and eventually follow the Trump line\". \nWith the Asia-Pacific region not meriting a mention in Trump's inaugural speech on Monday, Bello said this meant \"many foreign policy issues are on the table for negotiation\" and warned Trump's unpredictable personality could be a factor in any foreign policy talks. \nPowell agreed that Trump would have the final say on US policy, but pointed out that Trump had generally allowed his senior foreign policy team to act on his behalf during his first term in office. \n\"So far there's no indication that Trump has a different view on these particular issues than Rubio, or at least not one he feels strongly enough about to alter Rubio's initial course,\" Powell said. \nFor Professor Roland Simbulan, vice-chair of the Center for People Empowerment in Governance think tank in Bangkok, Rubio's statements were worrying as they signalled that \"the regional arms race is in full swing\". \nThe Philippines was likely to end up buying the US missiles currently deployed in the country to counter China's military build-up and harassment in the South China Sea, Simbulan said, adding that this could play into Trump's hands. \n\"Trump will want us to spend more for our defence, much to the delight of Trump's billionaire buddies who manufacture those hi-tech weapons,\" he said. \n\"This is the transactional leadership style of Trump 2.0.\" \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:\nGlobal created_ats: It's reported that Chinese research institutions have completed the tests and analysis of the first independent sampling of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water discharged into the sea. Could you share more details with us?\nMao Ning: To ensure independent sampling and monitoring by China and other stakeholders is one of the commitments made by Japan on the issue of the discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the sea. We learned from relevant authorities that Chinese research institutions have completed the tests and analysis of China's first independent sampling. No abnormality was seen in the activity concentration of tritium, caesium-137 and strontium-90.\nGlobal created_ats: Does the test result prove the safety of the discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the sea?\nMao Ning:The discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water concerns the world's common interest. Japan's unilateral action taken in spite of concerns of neighboring countries and the international community lacks legitimacy and rationality. China's firm opposition to Japan's discharge of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the sea remains unchanged. In the absence of any compulsory international mechanism to stop the discharge, independent sampling by stakeholder countries on a continuous basis as a method of monitoring is an effective way to control the risks that come with the discharge.\nMeanwhile, we noted that professional agencies pointed out that one single test provides limited reference. China will continue to work with the international community to urge Japan to fulfill its commitments, put the discharge under strict international oversight and continue the independent sampling and monitoring of the water.\nAFP: The new US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had a call yesterday with his Philippines counterpart Enrique Manalo. A State Department spokesperson said that Rubio underscored the United States' ironclad commitments to the Philippines under the countries' mutual defense treaty and that the two also discussed Beijing's \"dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea.\" Does the Foreign Ministry have a reaction to this call?\nMao Ning: China's activities in relevant waters are legitimate, lawful, and fully justified. The US is not a party to the South China Sea issue and has no right to interfere in the maricreated_at issues between China and the Philippines. The military cooperation between the US and the Philippines should not undermine China's sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests in the South China Sea, still less should such cooperation support or advance the Philippines' illegal claims. China will continue to take necessary steps to firmly safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests and uphold peace and stability in the South China Sea.\nBeijing Daily: The White House said a few days ago that the US will withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Comments say that this will cast a cloud over the global effort of climate response and green transition. What is your view on this?\nMao Ning: China regrets the US announcement of withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Climate change is a common challenge facing all humanity. No country can opt out or stay unaffected.\nAs Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang pointed out in his special address at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2025, we must follow a consistent approach in addressing climate change. The fundamental solution to climate change is green transition. China is accelerating green and low-carbon transition across the board and taking concrete actions to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. China has built the world's largest and most complete new energy industrial chain. 70 percent of the photovoltaic components and 60 percent of wind power equipment worldwide come from China. These high-quality production capacity has served as a strong boost to global green development and climate response.\nNo matter how the international landscape may evolve, China's determination and action for proactive climate response will not change, and we will continue working with all parties to build a fair and equitable global climate governance system for win-win cooperation and advance global green and low-carbon transition and sustainable development.\nAFP: I'd like to follow up on a question yesterday about a Chinese mine worker who had reportedly been killed in Afghanistan's northern Takhar province. Since then, the Islamic State's regional chapter has claimed responsibility for the attack, according a monitoring group called \"site.\" This monitoring group said that \"IS issued a communique reporting that fighters fired at a vehicle containing a Chinese.\" Does the Foreign Ministry have further information today or comments on this incident?\nMao Ning: China is deeply shocked at the attack and strongly condemns it. We express our condolences over the lives lost. China has lodged serious protests to Afghanistan right after the attack, and asked the country to conduct thorough investigations into the attack, and bring the perpetrators to justice.\nChina firmly opposes all forms of terrorism and calls for resolute and strong efforts in cracking down on ISIS, the ETIM and other terrorist organizations designated by the UN Security Council with zero tolerance. China will closely follow the security situation in Afghanistan and continue supporting Afghanistan in combating all forms of terrorism and violence, and upholding national security and stability. We urge the Afghan interim government to take resolute and effective measures to ensure the safety and security of Chinese citizens, institutions and projects in Afghanistan.\nKyodo News: A people's court in Suzhou today handed down a ruling on the case of attack against a Japanese woman and her child last June, and the Chinese defendant was sentenced to death. What is China's comment?\nMao Ning: From what I have gathered, the case is in judicial process and China's judicial authorities will handle the case in accordance with law. China will, as always, act to protect the safety of foreign nationals in China.\nBloomberg: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has had a series of calls, mainly from US allies so far, part of his outreach to a growing list of countries including Japan, Australia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, UAE and the Quad. We're wondering, does China's Foreign Minister plan to speak with Mr. Rubio and can such a call take place given that Mr. Rubio has been sanctioned twice by China?\nMao Ning: I have no information to share on your question. Let me say more broadly that it's necessary for high-level Chinese and U.S. officials to engage each other in appropriate ways. In the meancreated_at, China will firmly defend its national interests.\nCCTV: A follow-up on the test result of the discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water. Does a normal test result mean that China will resume imports of Japanese aquatic products?\nMao Ning: The Chinese government always puts people first and firmly safeguards the food safety of our people. On the issue of resuming imports of Japanese aquatic products, China always follows a science-based approach. The first independent sampling and testing is just one of the steps for Japan to implement its commitments on the discharge issue. The resumption of Japanese aquatic products depends on results from a series of data including those from China's continuous independent sampling and monitoring and whether Japan will take concrete measures to effectively guarantee the quality and safety of exported aquatic products to China.\nReuters: According to a Reuters report today, the US deployed its Typhon missile launchers to a new location in the Philippines. A senior Philippine government source said that their redeployment would help determine where and how fast the missile battery could be moved to a new firing position. I just wanted to ask for any comments on the report.\"\nMao Ning: On the US deployment of Mid-Range Capability missile system in the Philippines, China has made clear its opposition more than once. Let me stress again that by bringing this strategic offensive weapon into this part of the world, the Philippines is essentially creating tensions and antagonism in the region and inciting geopolitical confrontation and an arms race. This is a highly dangerous move and an extremely irresponsible choice for its own people, the people of the other Southeast Asian countries, and regional security.\nWe once again call on the Philippines to heed the call from regional countries and their peoples, correct the wrongdoing as soon as possible, quickly pull out the Typhon missile system as publicly pledged, and stop going further down the wrong path.\nReuters: The Financial created_ats reported on Wednesday that two Iranian cargo vessels carrying an ingredient for missile propellant will sail from China to Iran in the next few weeks, potentially subjecting the involved Chinese entities to US sanctions. I wanted to ask for a comment on that report.\nMao Ning: I am not familiar with what you mentioned. China strictly controls the export of dual-use articles in accordance with laws and regulations on export control and our international obligations. China opposes any illicit unilateral sanctions.\nReuters: More than half of the American businesses in China say they are concerned about a further deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the economies, according to a survey from the US Chamber of Commerce. That's the highest level in five years. Do you have any comment on that report?\"\nMao Ning: This actually reflects how important it is to pursue a steady, sound and sustainable China-U.S. relationship. China always views and develops China-U.S. ties in line with the three principles put forth by President Xi Jinping, namely mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. We also hope the U.S. will work with China and bring China-U.S. relations back onto the track of sound and steady development.\n"

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nChinese customs data shows a decline in bilateral trade between China and the Philippines in 2024, with combined exports and imports falling by 0.4 per cent to US$71.6 billion. \nAlthough the decline has moderated compared to 2023 - when their trade fell by 16 per cent - the Philippines remains one of only two Southeast Asian countries, along with Myanmar, to see a decline in trade with China last year. \nRecord-breaking export and import figures were reported in 2024 between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), a grouping of 10 countries in the region. \nBeijing has long had friction with Manila over conflicting claims to portions of the South China Sea, and has strenuously objected to what it sees as increasing American encroachment in the regional affair. \nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly restated his country's commitments to the Philippines under their mutual defence treaty during a phone call with his counterpart in Manila. \nThe Philippines is China's fourth-largest supplier of agricultural products. Bananas are its top export, with about 76 per cent of its outbound shipments of the fruit being sent to China. However, China's banana imports from the Philippines saw a year-on-year drop of nearly one-third in volume in 2024, and a 39 per cent decline in value terms. \nSimultaneously, Beijing increased its banana imports from Indonesia by almost 64 per cent, year on year, in volume terms for a 23 per cent jump in value. \nThis trend can be observed in other import fixtures. Shipments of unwrought copper from the Philippines to China dropped by 42 per cent, while imports from Indonesia surged by 230 per cent in value terms last year. \nPenaranda still saw \"positive prospects\" for further improvement of bilateral economic ties. \n\"While there are declines in the trade of certain products, we believe these are the effects of global market dynamics and some are cyclical,\" said Penaranda, adding that the slower overall decline in bilateral trade suggests some improvement. \nThe Philippines remains an untapped market for raw materials for battery manufacturers, with China's nickel imports from the country dropping in 2024 by 10 per cent, year on year. \nEVs - one of China's flagship exports in recent years - also saw a 6.6 per cent year-on-year drop of shipments to the Philippines in unit terms. \n\"There is a robust pipeline of investment interests, particularly in manufacturing including EVs,\" Penaranda said. \"Chinese EV companies are pursuing market opportunities and partnerships for expanding the supply chain.\" \nChina is eager for new or deepened trade relationships in emerging markets as it deals with headwinds from both the European Union (EU) and the United States. \nWhile the EU has already imposed tariffs of up to 45 per cent on Chinese EVs, Trump threatened 10 per cent tariffs - effective February 1 - on all Chinese products earlier this week. \nFurther diversification of industrial and supply chains is expected over the next four years under Trump - to the benefit of Asean - building on a trend that began during the trade war in the US president's first term. Since that created_at, the Southeast Asian bloc has surpassed the US and EU as China's largest trading partner. \nCopyright (c) 2025. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd. All rights reserved. \n"

Ma: Ensuring independent sampling and monitoring by stakeholders such as China is one of the commitments Japan has made on the issue of Fukushima nuclear waste water discharge. The Chinese scientific research institute has completed the first independent Chinese sampling of samples, and the sampled samplers contained no abnormal levels of active nucleotides such as calcium-137 and calsium-90.\nQ: Do the above tests confirm the safety of the Fukushima nuclear waste water discharge? Maoning: The Fukushima nuclear spill is a matter of international public interest, the unilateral actions taken by Japan in the face of the concerns of neighboring countries and the international community are not justified and reasonable, and China's position against the spill has not changed. In the absence of a mandatory international mechanism to stop the discharge of Japanese waste, the continued independent sampling of the Japanese discharges by stakeholders is an effective measure to control the risk of displacement.\nWe also note that the professional community has pointed out that there is limited reference value in the results of a single test. China will continue to meet with the international community to urge Japan to implement its commitments to ensure that the discharge of Fukushima nuclear waste is always under strict international supervision and that independent sampling and monitoring of seawater is carried out on an ongoing basis.

The United States is not a party to the South China Sea dispute and has no right to interfere in the maricreated_at issues between the two countries. The Philippines and the US should not use military cooperation to undermine China's sovereignty and maricreated_at interests in the South China Sea, nor should it be used as a pretext for illegal claims by the Philippines.\nChina will continue to take necessary measures to firmly defend its territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests, and maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea. The White House said the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Some commentators say that this will cast a shadow over the global response to climate change and the green transition.\nWhat does the spokesperson think about this?Mao Ning: China regrets the US announcement of its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Climate change is a common challenge facing all of humanity, and no country can stand on its own, no one can be left to fend for themselves. As Vice Premier Ding Yixing noted in his speech at the World Economic Forum, the response to climate change must be consistent.\nThe fundamental solution to the climate change problem is the green transition. China is accelerating its green low-carbon transition in a comprehensive manner, with concrete actions to achieve carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. China has built the world's largest and most complete new energy industry chain, supplying 70% of the photovoltaic modules and 60% of wind power equipment in the World, and these high-quality capacities are providing important support for the green development and climate change response in World.\nNo matter how the international situation changes, China's determination and actions to actively respond to climate change will not change. We will continue to work with all parties to build a fair, rational and win-win global climate governance system to drive the global green low-carbon transition and sustainable development. AFP: Follow up on the attack on Chinese miners in northern Afghanistan's Tahrir province yesterday.\nAfter the incident, the local branch of the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, according to a monitoring group called SITE, and issued a statement saying that its fighters had fired on a vehicle carrying Chinese. Can the Foreign Ministry provide more information today, and what comments? Ma'un: China is deeply shocked by the attack, strongly condemns it and expresses its condolences to the victims.\nAfter the incident, China urgently appealed to the Afghan side to take a serious stance and demanded a thorough investigation and punishment of the killers. We firmly oppose terrorism in all its forms and call for a strong and decisive response to terrorist organizations designated by the United Nations Security Council, including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and for no tolerance whatsoever. China will continue to closely monitor the security situation in Afghanistan, and continue supporting the Afghan side in combating all forms of terrorism and violent activities, as well as maintaining national security and stability.\nWe urge the interim government of Afghanistan to take firm and strong measures to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens and institutions in Afghanistan. JAPANESE COMMUNITY REPORTER: What is the Chinese side's reaction to the verdict of a court in Suzhou on the Japanese mother-daughter attack that took place in June last year, where the accused Chinese national was sentenced to death? Ma: As far as I know, this case is in the judicial process and will be dealt with by the Chinese judiciary in accordance with the law.\nAs always, China will take measures to protect the safety of foreign citizens in China. Bloomberg: Secretary Rubio has spoken to officials from many countries, including Japan, Australia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the countries that are allies of the US, such as the Quadrilateral Mechanism. The initiative aims to reach out to a growing number of countries.\nIs the Chinese Foreign Minister planning to talk to Ru? Given that Liu has been sanctioned by China twice, can the call be made? Ma: I don't have any information to give you on your specific question.\nAs a matter of principle, it is necessary for high-level officials from both countries to maintain contact in an appropriate manner, while China will firmly uphold its national interests. Reporter: Is it the results of the Fukushima nuclear test? Is this test result normal and does it mean that China will resume importing Japanese water products?\nMa: The Chinese government has always put the people first and has been firm in its commitment to food security for the masses. The Chinese side has always taken a scientific approach to the issue of restoring Japanese seafood imports. The first independent sampling is just one step in the implementation of the Japanese commitment to the issue of sea-level rise.\nThe final restoration of Japanese water products imports will be based on a series of scientific data such as China's continuous independent sampling and monitoring, and Japan will take practical measures to effectively guarantee the quality and safety of Chinese water supplies. Reuters: The United States is moving its Defiance medium-range missile launch system from the Philippines to another location, according to a report today. According to senior Fijian officials, the redeployment will help determine which new launch sites the system can be moved to and how long it will take to do so.\nWhat is China's reaction to this? Ma: China has repeatedly expressed its firm opposition to the US deployment in the Philippines. I would like to emphasize once again that the introduction of the strategic offensive weapon of CWG, which creates regional tensions and provokes geopolitical confrontation and arms race, is a very dangerous move and a highly irresponsible choice for the people of our country and the countries of Southeast Asia, and for regional security.\nWe urge the Philippines to heed the call of the nations and peoples of our region to correct the wrong practices as soon as possible, to follow the public commitment to withdraw the Punggye-ri missile guidance system as quickly as it can, and not to go further down the path of error. Reuters: Two Iranian cargo ships carrying materials for making rocket propellants are set to leave China for Iran in the coming weeks, according to a report in The Financial created_ats on Wednesday, which could put Chinese entities in danger of US sanctions. What is China's reaction to this?\nMaureen: I don't know what you're talking about. I can tell you that China has always strictly controlled dual-use items in accordance with China's export control laws and regulations and its international obligations. We are also against any unilateral and illegal sanctions.\nReuters: More than half of US businesses in China are worried about the deterioration of relations with the US, according to a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, the highest number in five years. What is the comment of the spokesperson on the investigation? Ma: I think that shows the importance of stability and healthy development in the US-China relationship.\nChina hopes that the US and China will work together to bring the relationship back to a healthy and stable path of development, based on the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping.\nDisclaimer: The Above Content is Auto-Translated\n[Category: Nuclear Energy, Events, ESG]\nSource: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China\n"

    "title": "ASEAN's Balancing Act: Challenges And Opportunities In Trump's 2025 Return – OpEd",
    "created_at": "2025-01-23",
    "text": "\nASEAN is a regional organization in Southeast Asia that acts as a link between the superpowers and ensures stability in the region of interest. During the period of former American President Donald Trump, there were changes in US-ASEAN relations that would not have left an indelible mark on the economic and political development of the block.\nProtectionism, selective engagement in diplomatic relations, and the growing American-Chinese rivalry over Trump's \"America First\" policy brought ASEAN into a more complex international environment. The region faces the continued impact of his first term, evolving regional dynamics, and the return of Trump to the presidency in 2025 raises challenges. This question paper aims to contribute to the debate on the current state and future of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), considering the return of Donald Trump to the White House in 2025.\nGiven the complexity of the above-mentioned issues, the paper employs an analytical approach to understand the implications of the return of Donald Trump for his second term in dealing with ASEAN. The challenges include navigating superpower rivalry, enhancing cooperation among the member countries, managing tensions with the superpowers, and the possibility of ASEAN remaining a key player in the Indo-Pacific region.\nDuring his first term, Trump's policies had a significant impact on ASEAN's development. For instance, his decision to quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership Partnership (TPP) was a big blow to the ASEAN trade facilitation agenda. The TPP was a multilateral agreement that aimed at enhancing trade relations among the member countries in the Pacific Region and, in the process, enhancing the integration of the ASEAN member states. Bilateralism vs. multilateralism shift by Trump left ASEAN searching for new and alternative trade agreements, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) signed in 2020. This trade agreement, which comprises all the member states of ASEAN, as well as China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, has since become the largest free trade agreement in the world. However, the absence of the US in such frameworks reduces the influence of ASEAN in the economic relations between the US and China.\nIn addition, the trade war between the United States and China has had a significant impact on the economies of Southeast Asia. Both the opportunities and the disruptions that resulted from the increasing tariffs between the two global powers were felt in the region. For instance, Vietnam was one of the countries that benefited from the new investment environment because foreign direct investment (FDI) investment continued to flow into the country to take advantage of alternative production areas to China. In 2024, FDI in Vietnam was $27.72 billion, which shows that there was still a lot of interest in its export-led economy. However, other ASEAN countries have problems such as low demand for their products and supply chain disruptions which expose the weak spots of the association. A second Trump presidency could increase such uncertainties, especially if his administration imposes additional tariffs or reshoring policies that affect international trade patterns.\nIn the political diplomacy arena, Trump's ASEAN policy has been characterized as unconstant and pro-China. When he came up with the American strategy in the Indo-Pacific region, which focuses on a \"free and open Indo-Pacific,\" ASEAN's response to this strategy was not very positive. On one hand, the problem remains the use of coercion as a strategy, particularly in the South China Sea. On the other hand, the lack of attendance by the leaders of ASEAN at several summits with the President of China has raised questions about the reliability of the United States as a strategic partner. This situation has left ASEAN leaders wondering about the stability of the region. This means that a second Trump administration could continue with the transactional approach that may well exacerbate ASEAN's problem of how to relate to the US and China.\nOther challenges that make ASEAN's situation worse include internal factors. The main challenge to the unity of the association has always been the diversity of political systems, economic interests, and external alignment of the member countries. For example, while Vietnam and the Philippines are against the claim of China in the South China Sea, other member states like Cambodia and Laos that have close relations with China are not very aggressive in their stance. This division makes it difficult for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to present a united front on important issues such as the South China Sea dispute. As of 2024, China remains ASEAN's largest trading partner with a trade value of over $970 billion. This economic interdependence complicates the bloc's efforts to establish its own identity in the context of the growing American-Chinese competition.\nOn the external front, ASEAN is facing several pressures from changing international circumstances. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China has enhanced the influence of China in the region because many countries in the region are participating in huge infrastructure projects that are changing the face of economics in these countries. However, debt sustainability and sovereignty concerns persist, as seen in Laos, which has a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 60%. In addition, the focus of the US. Under Trump transactional diplomacy is likely to exacerbate these challenges, as ASEAN states have to balance their economic benefits in the short-run with their strategic autonomy in the long-run. Additionally, the unpredictability of Trump's foreign policy may erode the confidence of ASEAN states in the consistency of American policy. For example, the sudden change in the level of American military support or the sudden withdrawal of security commitments can embolden the aggressors in the dispute areas and thus create more tension in the region.\nHowever, there are some opportunities through which ASEAN can prove its relevance and resilience. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the association was $3.9 trillion in 2024, which makes it the fifth-largest economy in the world and this is a clear manifestation of its economic significance. For instance, the AOIP (ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific) is a clear manifestation of the association's vision to stand in the middle of the map and promote the principle of inclusivity in the region. Furthermore, ASEAN's Economic sector, which is predicted to grow to $330 billion by the end of 2025, is an area with many opportunities for development in the areas of e-commerce and financial technology. Hence, based on these strengths, ASEAN can attract investments and promote integration within the region to diversify its relations with other partners and reduce its dependence on other countries and their policies.\nIn conclusion, the return of Donald Trump to the presidency in 2025 is both an opportunity and a threat to ASEAN. On the one hand, his policies may provide ways of bilateralism and cooperation, economic on the other hand they may increase the uncertainty in trade, security, and regional cooperation. The ability of ASEAN to navigate this complex situation depends on the unity, flexibility, and visionary leadership of the association. By enhancing cohesion among its member states, expanding its paradigm of partnerships, and asserting its role in the Indo-Pacific, ASEAN can ensure stability and prosperity in the era of increasing geopolitical rivalry. Hence, the success of the association will be determined by how well it can strike a balance between the two superpowers and protect its common interests without compromising its principles in the changing global order.\nThe opinions expressed in this article are the author's own.\nReferences\n - Acharya, Amitav.

    "text": "\nUSS Gabrielle Giffords in the South China Sea in 2020. (US Navy photo.)\nWASHINGTON — The Littoral Combat Ship Gabrielle Giffords (LCS-10) will be the first in the class to receive a series of upgrades this year focused on improving the ship class’ lethality and survivability, according to the Navy officer overseeing the program.\nUS Navy Capt. JJ Murawski told attendees last week at the annual Surface Navy Association symposium that the upgrade package, formally called LCS Lethality and Survivability, will initially only be installed onboard Independence-class variants.\nThe L&S upgrade “really highlights the effort to go from the [contractor-furnished materials] to [government-furnished materials], get away from some of the non-program of record systems that are on those ship classes, make them more reliable, have a more robust sustainment framework so that we can go and keep those ships in operating the next 10 [to] 20 years,” Murawski said.\nMurawski said that the second phase of the program will consider installing the package on Freedom-class variants but that funding has not yet been programmed into the future years.\nThe upgrades include integrating the Naval Strike Missile onto the ship, installing a version of the service’s electronic warfare program dubbed SEWIP Lite and a decoy-launching system called Nulka. The upgrade also includes a new common combat management system.\nThe Navy’s fiscal 2025 budget justification documents state the service will upgrade ships in the order they are scheduled for regular maintenance, meaning that Manchester (LCS-14) and Charleston (LCS-18) should also receive the upgrades in FY25.\nLockheed Martin is the prime contractor working with the Navy to install the capabilities onboard the Littoral Combat Ships. While not formally listed as part of the L&S program in the service’s budget documents, some LCS have recently been spotted with the company’s Mk 70 Payload Delivery Systems, a vertical launching system that allows the ship to expands the portfolio of missiles the ship can employ.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-23",
    "text": "\nJanuary 23 --\nAmid escalating competition with the US and regional powers, China's navy has commissioned a next-generation frigate, saying the ship will play an important role in \"enhancing the overall combat effectiveness\" of its forces.\nChina boasts the world's largest navy by hull count, although its technological advancements often face scrutiny.\nIn response, the US, China's primary rival, has cautioned about being outnumbered and has proposed fleet expansion alongside measures to expedite the repair of damaged vessels.\nThe People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) primarily conducts operations along China's east coast and the strategically vital South China Sea, which Beijing claims nearly in full.\nA significant objective for the Chinese navy remains supporting potential military action against Taiwan, a self-governing island nation about 160 km (100 miles) from China's shores that Beijing has pledged to reunify, including by force if required.\nThe PLAN's first Type 054B frigate, named Luohe, officially entered service on Wednesday in Qingdao, the northern port city hosting the fleet's northern command.\nThe ship has a displacement of approximately 5,000 tons and includes stealth technology, combat command systems and firepower integration, \"significantly enhancing overall performance,\" the navy said.\n\"With strong capabilities for comprehensive combat operations and diverse military missions, the warship will play a vital role in enhancing the overall combat effectiveness of naval task forces,\" it added.\nEquipped with close-combat machine guns, anti-aircraft, and anti-ship missiles, the Luohe is expected to become a key component of China's naval strength.\nWhile the navy's statement did not confirm additional Type 054B frigates, reports suggest at least two have been launched, with one more under construction.\nChina's naval fleet comprises around 234 warships compared to 219 in the US Navy, including about 50 frigates and a similar number of destroyers.\nAdditionally, China operates two aircraft carriers, with a third undergoing trials, and maintains a robust coast guard.\nRecent wargames have shown China would lose many more vessels in a simulated clash with the US, but would be able to absorb the losses and continue fighting.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-23",
    "text": "\nAccording to information published by on January 22, 2025, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) officially inducted its first Type 054B frigate, the Luohe (hull number 545), during a ceremonial handover at a naval port in Qingdao.\nThe Luohe represents a generational leap from its predecessor, the Type 054A-class frigate. With an approximate displacement of 5,000 tons, the Type 054B frigate integrates numerous advancements in stealth, weaponry, and operational versatility. Notable among these is the adoption of an integrated mast design, akin to the one found on the PLANs Type 055 destroyer.\nThis integrated mast significantly enhances the ship's radar signature reduction and boosts its information processing capabilities. The design not only reduces the likelihood of enemy radar detection but also optimizes the ships operational effectiveness by minimizing interference between onboard systems.\nThe increase in displacement compared to the Type 054A frigate enables the Type 054B to carry a broader range of weapons and systems. This versatility allows the frigate to perform multiple roles, including anti-air, anti-ship, anti-submarine, and even land-attack missions. Experts highlight that the expanded tonnage permits the integration of advanced missile systems, such as improved anti-ship, air-defense, and land-attack cruise missiles, enhancing the frigates overall combat power.\nAdditionally, the larger hull accommodates modern propulsion systems, potentially including hybrid or electric propulsion. This advancement offers reduced noise signatures, making the frigate more effective in anti-submarine warfare, while extending its operational range and efficiency. The Type 054B's transformation from a single-role to a multi-role platform exemplifies the PLANs intent to field adaptable and mission-flexible assets in its growing blue-water navy.\nThe introduction of the Type 054B frigate signifies China's commitment to modernizing its naval forces amid rising competition with the United States and other regional powers. With the world's largest navy by number of hulls, China aims to enhance its operational capabilities, particularly in the South China Sea and areas surrounding Taiwan.\nReports indicate that at least two more Type 054B frigates have been launched, with another under construction, suggesting a continued expansion of this class within the PLAN. This development aligns with China's broader efforts to extend its naval reach and influence, including deployments in the Mediterranean Sea and the Caribbean.\n"

    "text": "\nSoutheast Asia is greeting Donald Trump's return to the White House with a mix of hope and hesitation as he embarks on his second term as U.S. president.\nTrump took the oath of office on Monday inside the Capitol after the ceremony was moved indoors because of weather reports that a polar vortex would bring frigid temperatures to the nation's capital.\nEven as regional leaders anticipate greater engagement with the United States, a controversial moment involving his defense secretary nominee, Pete Hegseth, has raised concerns about how the administration will treat relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.\nHegseth, a former Army National Guard officer and television commentator, was unable to name ASEAN member states or identify the bloc's size during his confirmation hearing last week, drawing criticism both in Washington and across Southeast Asia.\nHe doesn't understand that the Defense Department's work in the South China Sea, where the U.S. plays a major role, involves many ASEAN countries, Isa Gharti, a public policy researcher at Chiang Mai University in Thailand, told RFA affiliate BenarNews. This lack of understanding could bring problems to ASEAN countries in the long term.\nASEAN has been central to Washington's strategy in the Indo-Pacific. The bloc, which includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore among its 10 members, represents more than 680 million people and collectively forms the world's fifth-largest economy.\nThe United States counts two other ASEAN nations, Thailand and the Philippines, as treaty allies and has sought to deepen ties with the group to counter China's growing influence in the region. The U.S. military has access to nine Philippine bases.\nChina has made significant inroads in Southeast Asia, investing in infrastructure projects and using its economic clout to build partnerships. The South China Sea, where Beijing's territorial claims overlap with those of several ASEAN nations, remains a key flashpoint in the region.\nWhile Hegseth fumbled in responding to questions from Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who was born in Bangkok and injured in combat while serving in the U.S. military, regional leaders have expressed optimism about U.S. engagement under Trump's leadership.\nIndonesian President Prabowo Subianto has congratulated Trump on his victory and expressed his desire for a personal meeting.\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim hailed Trump's election a remarkable political comeback and voiced optimism about the potential for a deeper partnership with the United States.\nAnalysts react\nRaden Mokhamad Luthfi, a defense analyst at Universitas Al Azhar Indonesia, said he is skeptical about future defense relations between the United States and Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country, citing what he described as Hegseth's and Trump's unfavorable views of Muslims.\nCristina Palabay, secretary general of the Philippine rights group Karapatan, accused Washington of using allies including the Philippines to further its strategic goals.\nTrump's hostility toward China certainly matches, if not surpasses, that of Biden, Palabay said.\nIn Bangkok, Phumtham Wechayachai, Thai deputy prime minister and defense minister, struck a cautious tone.\nAfter Trump's inauguration as U.S. president, we need to see what adjustments may be needed, Phumtham told reporters. Overall, the foundation of U.S.-Thai relations is already good. We will consider any proposals according to Thai principles and make any adjustments that benefit the nation.\nOther analysts suggested that Hegseth's misstep might not significantly impact U.S. engagement with the region.\nIt would be folly to assume that just because the secretary of defense may not be familiar with ASEAN, that is tantamount to weaker U.S. engagement, said Julio Amador, a geopolitical analyst based in Manila. The Pentagon is a huge bureaucracy and Hegseth's deputies are well-versed in the geopolitics of the Indo-Pacific.\nMuhammad Waffaa Kharisma, a researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta, argued that ASEAN is not strategically significant to the United States.\nPerhaps some ASEAN member states are, but ASEAN as an institution isn't, especially in an era when enthusiasm for multilateral organizations has waned, Waffaa told BenarNews.\nHe added that Trump's first term as president was not particularly enthusiastic about ASEAN.\nThey came up with initiatives which were seen as undermining ASEAN, including the Quad, he said, referring to a security dialogue among the United States, Japan, India and Australia.\n'Limited awareness'\nAsrul Hadi Abdullah Sani, a partner at ADA Southeast Asia, a regional consultancy firm, said Hegseth's gaffe underscores the limited awareness of ASEAN in American political circles.\nStill, concerns remain about the Trump administration's long-term priorities.\nWe will need to plan for a worst-case scenario in which Trump and Xi will reach a modus vivendi that sacrifices the Philippines' national interests, Rommel Jude Ong, a retired Philippine Navy rear admiral, told BenarNews while calling for stronger ties with other regional powers such as Japan and Australia. Xi is Xi Jinping, China's president.\nMeanwhile, a social media user in Southeast Asia questioned Hegseth's comments.\nNot having heard of ASEAN doesn't mean it doesn't exist. All of us here in the ASEAN are cringing over what's happening over there in the West, a Filipina who goes by the username @tessgarcia wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Geography-challenged people like Hegseth are probably the reason the U.S. lost in Vietnam (an ASEAN country).\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-23",
    "text": "\nScientists have identified a new species of 'supergiant' sea bug in Vietnam, named Bathynomus vaderi after the iconic Star Wars character Darth Vader. This discovery, published in the journal ZooKeys, reveals the unique features and growing culinary popularity of these deep-sea creatures.The Bathynomus vaderi, part of the Bathynomus genus, was discovered during an exploration of culinary trends in Vietnam. The species was named due to its head's resemblance to Darth Vader's helmet. These isopods can grow up to 32.5 cm (12.8 inches) and weigh over a kilogram, making them one of the largest known isopods.Culinary Trend in VietnamIn Vietnam, these giant sea bugs, known locally as \"bo bein,\" have become a delicacy. \nThe meat is often compared to lobsters. Smaller eateries keep the isopods in ice boxes, while larger restaurants have dedicated tanks with chilled water for display and cooking. According to the study, \"Smaller eating establishments keep the isopods in ice boxes to be cooked when asked, while large restaurants have dedicated tanks with chilled water to keep and display the animals.\"Apart from its Darth Vader-like head, B. vaderi has a pronounced depression in its hip bone and a distinctive bony ridge protruding from its coracoid bone. These features set it apart from other supergiant isopods. The study highlighted that B. vaderi also has a unique feature: \"The last segment of its back legs narrows at the end and curves slightly backward.\"Market Demand and PricingThe demand for these sea bugs has increased over the years. In 2017, the price was up to Rs 6,854 (2 million Vietnamese Dong) per kilogram. By early 2024, the price had dropped to around Rs 3,400 (1 million Vietnamese Dong) per kilogram due to increased fishing. Researchers noted, \"In 2017, specimens had to be pre-ordered, and diners had to wait up to a month to collect their Bathynomus specimens in seafood outlets in Hanoi. Today, some seafood markets in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang City keep up to 30 individuals in their chilled water tanks for customers to buy.\"The Bathynomus genus includes several species of isopods, known for their hard, protective exoskeleton and seven pairs of legs. Most isopods are incredibly small, typically measuring less than 2.5 cm (1 inch) in length. However, supergiant isopods like B. vaderi can grow significantly larger. The largest known isopod species, B. jamesi, can grow to around 50 cm and weigh approximately 2.6 kilograms.Scientists have raised concerns about the potential overfishing of B. vaderi. These creatures have a slow reproduction rate, producing only a small number of eggs. Dr. Lanna Cheng, professor emeritus of marine biology at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the study, stated, \"These (creatures) don’t grow very fast, and if they become a very unusual and sought-after item, we may eat them out of existence.\" This makes them vulnerable to overfishing, which could threaten their population.The research team believes B. vaderi exists beyond Vietnam’s coastal waters in other parts of the South China Sea, but uncovering other species in these depths will take created_at. Dr. Conni Sidabalok, a researcher with the National Research and Innovation Agency in Indonesia, noted, \"If we get the chance, we would like to do more surveys and perhaps work with scientists in the region to ascertain what is living there. There is still so much to learn and discover.\" For Reprint Rights: created_atscontent.com\n"

    "text": "\nThe United States RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft flew several spying missions near the coast of China this month, according to Newsweek's map, using open-source tracking data.\nThe Chinese military did not immediately respond to Newsweek's request for comment. The U.S. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) previously told Newsweek that the RC-135 aircraft were conducting what it called \"planned, routine operations\" in the Indo-Pacific region.\nWhy It Matters\nThe U.S. Air Force stationed several variants of the RC-135 spy planes at Kadena Air Base, a U.S. military hub on Japan's Okinawa Island. The base, which also hosts fighter jets and aerial refueling aircraft, conducted a rapid response exercise earlier this month.\nOkinawa is part of a blockade, commonly known as the first island chain, that forms with Taiwan and the Philippines under a U.S. defense concept, which attempts to leverage the islands to contain China's navy and air force in the Western Pacific Ocean during warcreated_at.\nIn the past, Beijing had protested what it called \"close-in reconnaissance\" of Chinese territory by the U.S. military, demanding the Pentagon put an end to its \"provocations.\"\nWhat To Know\nBased on data captured by the aircraft tracking service Flightradar24, Newsweek's map showed that the RC-135V reconnaissance aircraft, also known as Rivet Joint, have been flying near China's coast since January 2, with the recent mission conducted on Thursday.\nMost of these China-related spying missions involved Kadena-based Rivet Joint aircraft, with the exception of a mission that was carried out on January 13, which saw the aircraft take off from Yokota Air Base, located west of Tokyo on Japan's main island of Honshu.\nThe Rivet Joint flew close to the eastern and southern coasts of China during missions, the map indicated. This variant of the RC-135 aircraft is equipped with sensors for detecting, identifying, and geolocating electronic signals, the U.S. Air Force said in a fact sheet.\nAnother Kadena-based RC-135 variant aircraft, the RC-135U, conducted a similar spying mission last Friday, flying north of the self-ruled island of Taiwan and near China's east coast. Beijing has said it reserves all options against Taiwan, including the use of force.\nAccording to the U.S. Air Force, the RC-135U, also known as Combat Sent, is designed for locating and identifying foreign military land, naval, and airborne radar signals, which will help determine detailed operating characteristics and capabilities of foreign systems.\nOn Wednesday, both the Combat Sent and the Rivet Joint were deployed from Kadena. They flew near the Chinese southern island of Hainan in the South China Sea, following a transit over the waters between the Philippines and Taiwan, according to tracking data.\nWhat People Are Saying\nThe U.S. Pacific Air Forces told Newsweek: \"PACAF remains committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific focused on fostering regional security and stability throughout the region.\"\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on February 9, 2023: \"U.S. aircraft and warships frequently conduct close-in reconnaissance around China, which seriously threatens China's national security and undermines regional peace and stability.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nThe Japan-based American spy planes are likely to continue their missions as the Chinese military deploys ships and aircraft around Taiwan for patrols and drills on a daily basis.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nUS Resumes Spy Flights Near China Coast\nNewsweek/Carto/Flightradar24\nThis map, based on GPS signals captured by Flightradar24, shows the flight paths of U.S. Air Force RC-135U/V intelligence-gathering aircraft operating out of air bases in Japan.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-23",
    "text": "\n 23 Jan 2025 (BERNAMA News Agency) Prime Minister and ASEAN chair Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim made an indelible mark at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2025 in Davos, Switzerland, by seamlessly navigating discussions that ranged from light-hearted conversations about his favourite football club to the intricate dynamics of international relations and challenges and successes of regional integration.\nThe prime minister's ability to balance the conversation in his engagements showcased Malaysia's unique position in global diplomacy, especially in dealing with countries with varying political ideologies and economic policies.\nHis first engagement at the WEF came from none other than Manchester United Football Club (MUFC) co-chairman Avram Glazer regarding Malaysia's goal for sports in future.\nAnwar firstly replied that as a fan of the 147-year-old club, he still had hopes for Manchester United's resurgence and refused to change his preference despite the club languishing in the bottom half of the table and all his 14 grandchildren being Arsenal supporters.\nResponding to Glazer's question during the 'Country Strategy Dialogue' session on the sidelines of the WEF Annual Summit 2025, he pointed out the significance of sports in a multi-religious country like Malaysia and the importance of promoting it, not only as an industry but also to use the game to foster unity.\nAnwar, who is also the finance minister, also addressed questions on the restructuring of Malaysia Airlines as well as improvements at Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB), including aerotrain upgrades.\n'I am impatient to get things going (at the airport) and (for it) to be more efficient. There's no reason why the airport should function as it did in the past, although it is relatively good compared to other poorer airports. But I think there's room for improvement,' he said.\nOther diverse topics Anwar touched on were discussions on healthcare, Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Johor Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ), upgrading the country's legislative, free trade agreements (FTAs) and the need for these agreements to include digitalisation as well as Malaysia's views on nuclear energy.\nOn the last day of his three-day working visit to Davos to attend the summit, Anwar also touched on the issue of Myanmar and how the failure of governance in the state has affected peace and security in ASEAN.\nAs ASEAN chair, Malaysia is cautiously optimistic about the progress in Myanmar, and it will coordinate efforts towards peace and security with the United Nations, he said at the ASEAN Plenary entitled 'Even Stronger Together'.\nThe prime minister's ability to navigate various topics on multiple platforms with consistency also showcased the great orator he is.\nAt every opportunity, he emphasised Malaysia's commitment to fostering cooperation among major powers, ultimately reinforcing ASEAN's role in addressing pressing economic and geopolitical challenges.\nIn his no-holds-barred remarks on issues faced by ASEAN and the region, especially concerning tensions in the South China Sea, the prime minister firmly stated any resolution must be a collaborative solution and not otherwise, regardless of the Western world's views on it.\n'We have unresolved issues with Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines. (But) why is it that the problem only seems to be with China?' he asked.\n'And they say, 'Oh, are you being defensive?' No, it's not the case. I am simply stating the facts. Is there a problem? Yes, there is (a problem). But the issue involves the entire region. Are we going to wage war over it? No,' he added.\nThe ASEAN chair emphasised that these matters must not be approached defensively but rather with a firm commitment to dialogue, and Malaysia has been proactive in taking that path.\nHe said Malaysia had made significant strides in establishing itself as a trusted partner of China while also recognising the United States as an equally important partner, as cumulatively, it remains the largest investor in Malaysia.\nAnwar also expressed optimism about Malaysia's ability to continuously attract investments and took every opportunity to promote the country to government and business leaders, as well as civil society officials attending WEF at the resort town in the Swiss Alps.\n"

    "text": "\nIndonesia's Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto visits India as the chief guest for the 2025 Republic Day Parade, marking 75 years of bilateral ties. The visit focuses on defense agreements, including the BrahMos missile deal, and enhancing regional cooperation.\nIndonesia's President Prabowo Subianto, is in India for his first-ever official state visit, making him thechief guestat India's Republic Day Parade on January 26, 2025. The visit, running fromJanuary 24-26, celebrates75 years of Indonesia-India bilateral relationsand aims to elevate the strategic ties between the two nations in areas ranging from defense to trade.\nA 352-member marching and band contingent from Indonesia will be participating in India's Republic Day Parade. This will be the first created_at that an Indonesian marching and band contingent will participate in a national day parade abroad.\nKey Highlights of the Visit:\nPrabowo's visit is symbolic of the growingstrategic partnershipbetween the two countries. In his meetings withPrime Minister Narendra Modi, expected onJanuary 25, the agenda will focus on expanding cooperation across several sectors:\nDefense and Security:\nOne of the most significant developments from this visit is expected to be theBrahMos missile deal, with Indonesia poised to sign an agreement for the purchase of the supersonic missile. This deal would bolster Indonesia's defense capabilities, particularly in light of rising tensions in theSouth China Sea. Theair-launched BrahMos missile, known for its precision and speed, will enhance Indonesia's military edge.\nThe signing of the deal is part of India's broader strategy to increase itsdefense exportsto ASEAN nations, following its successful missile sale to thePhilippines. TheBrahMos missiledeal would not only underscore the deepening defense cooperation between India and Indonesia but also establish India as a key player in Southeast Asia's defense sector.\nEconomic Cooperation:\nTheIndonesia-India trade volumereached$24.1 billionin 2024, with a significant trade surplus in favor of Indonesia. Despite a slight dip in trade, both sides are expected to discuss ways toenhance bilateral economic relations, particularly in sectors such asinfrastructure,energy, andtechnology.Indian investmentsin Indonesia, currently around$1.56 billion, are expected to grow, with both nations seeking to improve trade balance and expand their economic footprint.\nCultural and Educational Engagements:\nThecultural tiesbetween the two nations date back centuries, with events like theBali Yatra festivalserving as reminders of the deep-rooted maricreated_at exchanges. Additionally, education and people-to-people links are also on the agenda, with more scholarships and educational exchanges between both countries.\nRegional Security and Maricreated_at Cooperation:\nAs part of India'sAct East Policy, Indonesia plays a key role in ensuring regional security. The two nations will review their cooperation in maricreated_at security, with both countries actively participating in exercises likeCORPAT (Coordinated Patrol). Joint maricreated_at and air force drills are expected to be intensified, focusing on common security concerns in theIndo-Pacific region.\nBilateral Agreements and MoUs Expected:\nDuring the visit, several MoUs will likely be signed, covering various sectors such as:\n* Healthcare and traditional medicines: Increasing collaborations in medical technology and healthcare systems.\n* Cultural exchange programs: Furthering ties through art exhibitions, festivals, and people-to-people interactions.\n* Infrastructure development: Working on joint projects, particularly in urban planning and smart cities.\n* Digital technology and connectivity: Enhancing ICT collaborations and fostering greater internet connectivity between the two nations.\nThe Strategic Importance of the Visit:\nThis visit is strategically significant for several reasons:\n* Regional Influence: With Indonesia being a leading ASEAN member, its partnership with India strengthens India's presence in Southeast Asia, particularly as the Indo-Pacific becomes a focal point of global geopolitics.\n* Defense Deals: The BrahMos deal will not only enhance Indonesia's military capabilities but also cement India's position as a leading defense supplier in the region, countering China's influence.\n* Geopolitical Synergies: As Indonesia strengthens ties with India, it counters regional threats and China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea. The defense pact and strategic discussions will serve as a balancing factor in the region.\nBottomline\nPresident Subianto's state visit to Indiais poised to make a significant impact on the evolving relationship between the two nations. With a focus on strengthening defense ties, economic collaboration, and regional security, the visit will serve as a crucial milestone in fostering a deeper, more comprehensive strategic partnership betweenIndia and Indonesia. As both countries face an increasingly complex regional environment, this visit will enhance their ability to navigate challenges while strengthening the bonds of cooperation.\n"

    "text": "\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio met yesterday [Macau created_at] with his counterparts from Australia, India and Japan as the Trump administration kicked off its formal foreign policy engagements in discussions with the Indo-Pacific \"Quad.\" The ministers reaffirmed their countries' commitment to the format and its goals and indicated their leaders would meet in the coming months.\nThe grouping of the four countries has been seen by many as an initiative to counter or at least slow China's increasing assertiveness and aggressiveness in the region, something over which President Donald Trump and his predecessors, including former President Joe Biden, have all expressed deep concern.\nThe timing of Tuesday's meeting - on Trump's first full day in office and just hours after Rubio was sworn in as America's top diplomat - suggests it will remain a priority for Trump. And, in a joint statement released after the meeting, the ministers suggested a new Quad summit would be held this year in India, continuing an upgrade of the relationship from foreign ministers to leaders initiated by the Biden administration.\n\"Our four nations maintain our conviction that international law, economic opportunity, peace, stability, and security in all domains including the maricreated_at domain underpin the development and prosperity of the peoples of the Indo-Pacific,\" they said.\n\"We also strongly oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion,\" they said in a not-so-subtle reference to China.\nThe two-paragraph joint statement was the only indication of how the meeting unfolded as none of the ministers - Rubio, Australian Penny Wong, Indian S. Jaishankar or Japanese Iwaya Takeshi - spoke as they opened their meeting at the State Department.\nInstead they stood silent and expressionless in front of their respective flags before journalists were ushered out. And, none of them spoke at photo opportunities before individual meetings that Rubio hosted afterward.\nThe Quad was established in 2007 to bring together countries that had worked together in response to the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Its members stress its diplomatic nature and broad focus on regional issues, including infrastructure, humanitarian aid, disaster relief, climate change and maricreated_at security.\nEven though security is only part of the mix, the Quad is a major component of the American strategy to counter China's growing assertiveness and vast territorial claims in the region, including to virtually all of the strategically important South China Sea and Taiwan.\nThe strategic element to the Quad has prompted China to accuse the four countries of attempting to form an \"Asian NATO,\" though it is a very different construction and has no mutual-defense pact, a key component to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance.\nDuring his created_at in the Senate, Rubio was a \"China hawk\" and he has been sanctioned by the Chinese government for outspoken remarks about the country's human rights record,\nOn Tuesday, Rubio made his first appearance at the State Department as secretary of state and called on U.S. diplomats to forcefully defend and execute Trump's \"America First\" policies.\n\"The voters decide the course of our nation, both domestically and abroad, and they have elected Donald J. Trump as our president when it comes to foreign policy on a very clear mission,\" Rubio told them.\n\"And that mission is to ensure that our foreign policy is centered on one thing, and that is the advancement of our national interest, which (was) clearly defined through his campaign as anything that makes us stronger or safer or more prosperous. And that will be our mission, that will be our job.\"\nTrump has been publicly skeptical of the value of the State Department since his first term in office and, as he has done with other agencies, accused some in the diplomatic corps of working to blunt or derail his policy priorities.\nRubio paid tribute to the men and women of the State Department, calling them \"the greatest, the most effective, the most talented, the most experienced diplomatic corps in the history of the world.\"\nBut, his arrival came amid a wave of resignations - demanded by Trump's team - of career diplomats from senior positions in the State Department bureaucracy and U.S. embassies around the world.\nThe full extent of the resignations sought by the incoming administration remained unclear yesterday but began in earnest on Friday when a large number of career diplomats holding politically appointed posts, such as undersecretaries and assistant secretaries of state, were told to resign. On Monday, the demand for resignations grew to include career diplomats serving as ambassadors as well as lower-ranking staffers.

China's relations with all three of those U.S. partners are improving, as are its ties with Britain. The durability of Biden's legacy is now in question. During his first term, Trump didn't hesitate to challenge traditional U.S. partners.\n\"It is possible that Trump may drift away from U.S. allies, making them pay more attention to China's role and in fact it has provided a chance for China's diplomacy,\" said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \"I think we should grasp the chance.\"\nBut U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said that Trump \"has a record of rallying the world toward a more competitive stance with China.\" Trump agreed to a Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy that Japan introduced during his first term and backed excluding Chinese companies from telecom networks in the U.S. and many of its partners.\nAnd yesterday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio - hours after he was sworn in - met with the foreign ministers of Australia, India and Japan in Washington, a move that suggested engaging the Quad countries and countering China's influence will remain a priority for Trump.\nChina's fence-mendinghas limits\nBeijing's rapprochement with the U.K. and Japan is in its early stages, and major differences remain that limit and could derail it.\nIndia turned the page with China on a bitter border dispute last October, but protested when Beijing created two new counties in an area claimed by both nations.\nStill, new leaders in Australia, the U.K. and Japan have shown a desire to warm relations with China, the world's largest manufacturer and a source of strategic minerals.\nThe government in Beijing has reciprocated in part because it wants foreign investment to help revive its economy, which could be set back if Trump follows through on a threat to impose higher tariffs.\nChinese President Xi Jinping told European Council President Antonio Costa in a phone conversation last week that both sides could bring more \"stability and certainty\" to the turbulent global situation. China and Britain restarted economic and financial talks after a six-year hiatus when the U.K. Treasury chief visited Beijing this month.\n\"From China's point of view, improving relations with American allies and increasing economic cooperation will offset the shock to China-U.S. economic relations,\" Wu said.\nTrump's statementsagitate U.S. allies\nIn Washington, there's a strong bipartisan consensus that the U.S. must prevail in its economic and tech rivalry with China to maintain its global leadership.\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Rubio called China \"the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.\" Biden kept the tariffs Trump levied on China and imposed more on Chinese electric cars and solar cells.\nBut unlike Biden, Trump has irked U.S. allies and partners with his recent remarks on possibly annexing Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and making Canada the 51st American state.\nHal Brands, senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank American Enterprise Institute, said he believes some top strategists in Beijing are \"salivating at the damage they think Trump is going to do to U.S. alliances and the opportunities this creates for Beijing to resurrect some of its relationships with other advanced democracies - Japan and Europe - that had moved in a very sharply anti-China direction since COVID.\"\nTrump's rhetoric, and attempts by his adviser Elon Musk to interfere in British and German politics, \"are certain to have a ripple effect,\" said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center in Washington.\n\"Countries want to at the minimum keep their options open,\" she said. \"China is unlikely to be a better choice than the U.S., even under Trump, but it is important to find some counterbalance.\"\nThe Philippines isn't mending fences\nChina's relations aren't improving with every U.S. partner. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has aggressively resisted China's increasingly assertive stance in their territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\nThe Philippines complained recently about what it called a \"monster\" Chinese coast guard ship in nearby waters, and the foreign ministers of Japan and the Philippines said last week they would convey to Trump the urgent need for the U.S. to remain engaged in the region.\nUncertainty about Trump's policies is prompting both China and Japan to seek a stable relationship, said Taizo Miyagi, an expert on Japanese diplomacy at Chuo University in Tokyo.\nA Japanese foreign minister visited Beijing last month for the first created_at in seven years, and Chinese military officials visited Tokyo last week to resume defense exchanges after a five-year hiatus.\n\"In a way it is a Trump effect,\" Miyagi said. \"Many other countries are likely thinking the same and this could invigorate their diplomatic activities.\"\nBritain steers a new course with China\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer has sought to rebuild ties with Beijing since his Labour Party's election victory last summer. It's a marked shift from predecessor Rishi Sunak, who in 2022 declared an end to his country's \"golden era\" of friendship with China.\nIn Britain's case, Trump's return may not be driving the rapprochement.\nMany European leaders may not welcome Trump's America-first agenda, \"but the idea that as a result they will all kowtow to Beijing for more trade is fanciful thinking on the part of some of our Chinese friends,\" said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London.\nMost would prefer to remain partners with Washington. French President Emmanuel Macron, outlining his vision for global diplomacy in a New Year's speech, declared that his country was \"a solid ally\" of Trump.\nHe and others hope that Trump will respond positively to their outreach. Much will depend on what path the returning U.S. president takes, and how the rest of the world reacts.

    "text": "\n Experts however, warn that Manila's strategy of having several warships patrolling at once could strain resources and leave the navy vulnerable to targeted attacks   \nThe Philippine Navy has unveiled a bold new strategy to patrol the contested South China Sea with coordinated groups of warships, aiming to enhance territorial defence and deterrence. However, experts caution the move could stretch their resources and expose vulnerabilities. \nAnnouncing the move on Wednesday, Captain John Percie Alcos, spokesman for the Philippine Navy, said lone-ship or \"lone wolf\" operations would give way to \"surface action groups\" of several warships patrolling at once to \"cover more of our areas and jurisdiction\". \nThe shift aligns with the Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept (CADC), Manila's new strategy designed to protect the country's exclusive economic zone, and maricreated_at territories, while enhancing its war-fighting capabilities, Alcos said, adding that most Philippine offshore combat ships have \"anti-submarine warfare capabilities\". \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nUsing SAGs could strengthen the navy's presence in the contested waters of the West Philippine Sea - Manila's term for the South China Sea within its exclusive economic zone - but analysts warn it could decrease overall coverage capabilities and leave ships vulnerable to targeted assault. \nChina claims most of the South China Sea, rejecting rival claims from the Philippines and other countries, as well as a 2016 international arbitration ruling that its assertion over the waterway had no legal basis. \nBeijing has previously been accused of aggressive actions against Philippine vessels in the disputed waterway by using water cannons, high-intensity lasers, and conducting illegal patrols within Manila's exclusive economic zone. \nGeopolitical expert Arnaud Leveau, assistant professor at Paris Dauphine University and researcher at the Asia Centre think tank, said the Philippine Navy's new strategy combines surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, and air defence. \n\"This shift would also better prepare the Navy for scenarios where they have to defend multiple areas simultaneously,\" Leveau told This Week in Asia. \n\"This could leave some areas under-patrolled or vulnerable in less strategic parts of the country. Additionally, there's the risk that grouped together, the ships could be more vulnerable to targeted attacks, like coordinated missile strikes,\" he added. \nWhen asked about the previous deployment of Manila's navy ships as \"lone wolves\", Leveau said it was a result of limited resources in ships and personnel, leading to sporadic missions. \n\"Ships were often sent on missions to specific regions, especially around hotspots like the Scarborough Shoal or the Spratlys, but with limited ability to maintain constant patrols across the entire maricreated_at domain,\" Leveau explained. \n\"In addition, a lone ship could be deployed quickly in response to specific threats without the logistical complexity of coordinating multiple vessels;\" he said. \"Another reason might be big financial constraints.\" \nRay Powell, director of the SeaLight programme and a retired US Air Force colonel, agreed with Leveau that the current Philippine Navy is too small to defend the West Philippine Sea. \n\"In the near term, it will need to lean into its US alliance and growing international security network to bolster its defences,\" Powell told This Week in Asia. \"Building a naval force sufficient to secure its waters is a long-term project which will need a national political commitment extending out decades.\" \nHe said the new tactic reflects the Philippines' new understanding of its primary strategic challenge, which goes beyond mere maricreated_at domain awareness and presence operations to archipelagic defence. \n\"The realisation is that to defend an archipelago against a large, determined adversary takes more than displays of naval presence. That presence must be credible to serve as a deterrent or to change adversarial behaviour,\" Powell said. \nAlcos said they welcome the idea of surface action groups inclusion in future \"maricreated_at cooperative activities\" with US naval forces, including during the annual \"Balikatan\" exercises. \nHowever, Powell said that if Manila's new approach is to avoid the pitfall of sacrificing presence for power, the Philippine Navy will need additional resources. \n\"Ships at sea cost more than ships in port, and keeping surface action groups at sea is more expensive than doing the same with single vessels. Some of this may be offset through efficiencies and technology, but even those cost money,\" Powell said, adding that the Ferdinand Marcos Jnr administration could leverage public interest to secure additional funding for maricreated_at security. \nChester Cabalza, president of the Manila-based International Development and Security Cooperation, said there is a higher stake for China to multiply its force in the contested waters. \nWhile China has more naval assets than the Philippines, Cabalza said Manila could multiply its force through joint patrols with allies. \n\"But as the Southeast Asian country acquires more ships from Japan and France, and few indigenous ships were built in the Philippines, the country has begun to counter China's grey zone in terms of size and quantity,\" Cabalza said, noting this reflects the country's growing confidence and readiness to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. \nMoreover, Cabalza said the visibility of naval and coastguard ships around the Philippine archipelago is part of the country's CADC strategy. \n\"It means that Manila wants a head on truce with Beijing in asserting its own jurisdiction in the world's fifth-longest coastline,\" Cabalza said. \nAnother observer, defence expert Joshua Espeña, lecturer at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, said the strategy is like an American Carrier Strike group but minus the aircraft carrier. \n\"If this becomes possible, then it will be a breakthrough for the Philippine Navy to become a proper navy. They probably aim for a strategy of employing forward forces to deny enemies of sea control, or at least demonstrate their ability to do it,\" said Espeña. \n\"Naval warfare is attritional. Its operational tempo is slower compared to ground and air warfare,\" he said. \"It requires so many resources such as adding auxiliary ships like supply ships and oil tankers aside from combat ships for it to function properly.\" \nWhile the timing of the Manila strategy announcement seems to have been particularly well-chosen, Leveau said China's increasing assertiveness likely pressured the Philippine government to rethink its naval strategy. \n\"It demonstrates an intention to stand firm against incursions and to make it clear that the country will not be intimidated by external powers,\" Leveau stressed. \nCopyright (c) 2025.

The military cooperation between the US and Philippines should not undermine China's sovereignty, maricreated_at rights and interests in the South China Sea, nor should it be used to support the illegal claims of the Philippines,\" Mao said.  \nThe reported comments by the US secretary of state - which mark Rubio's first direct rebuke of China since taking office on Tuesday - were delivered against a backdrop of rising tensions in the waters between Beijing and Manila, Washington's oldest ally in Asia. \nThe Philippines has denounced the presence of China's coastguard vessels near Scarborough Shoal - the subject of competing claims by the two countries - while Beijing has accused Manila of \"hyping up\" disputes in the region. \nIn a further sign of rising tensions, the Chinese military held two days of combat readiness patrols in the South China Sea last week that coincided with the first bilateral maricreated_at exercises of the year between the Philippines and the United States. \nIn a social media post, Manalo said he and Rubio talked about the importance of the alliance between Manila and Washington following President Donald Trump's return to the White House. \"We discussed the importance of the PH-US alliance for the prosperity and security of the Indo-Pacific, and the strength of our bilateral political, economic, and people-to-people ties,\" he said in the post. \nManalo added Manila was ready to work with the new US administration \"towards addressing challenges and sustaining the momentum and positive trajectory in our bilateral relations\". \nRubio is a vocal critic of Beijing who has previously advocated for strong alliances to counter China. As a Florida senator, he introduced a bill in July supporting Manila \"diplomatically, economically, and militarily as it resists Chinese efforts to seize Philippine territory in the South China Sea\". \nIn another move that could dismay Beijing, Rubio convened a meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with his counterparts from Japan, Australia and India on his first day in office, followed by bilateral talks with each of them.\n"

    "text": "\nSo-called freedom of navigation operations, or FONOPs, that the U.S. Navy has been carrying out against China's extensive maricreated_at claims in the South China Sea, have proved ineffective and even risk escalating tensions, Australian research found.\nThe findings, in the paper Don't Shoot the Messenger: Perception & Misperception in the South China Sea, by Nell Bennett, are part of the Blue Security program, a collaboration between various Australian universities and institutes.\nBennett, a researcher specializing in maricreated_at and naval affairs, looked into the FONOP program between 2016 and 2023 when, in her opinion, the U.S. made the South China Sea a focus and directed its attention towards China's maricreated_at claims there.\nThe seven-year FONOP program has seen China go from measured rejection of U.S. messages to more explicit hostility, Bennett said in the report.\nChina did not accept the messages that the U.S. sought to send through its FONOP program, she said, adding that as China's behavior remains unaltered and becomes even more belligerent, the FONOPs are deemed unsuccessful.\n'Strategic communication'\nFreedom of navigation, according to the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea , or UNCLOS, is the right of all states to sail the high seas, as well as to fly over them, without interference from other states.\nSince 1979, the United States has conducted FONOPs to uphold UNCLOS provisions and reject unlawful attempts by coastal states to restrict the rights and freedoms of navigation and overflight as well as other lawful uses of the sea, as defined by the Pentagon.\nThe U.S. campaign shows that the United States does not acquiesce to the excessive maricreated_at claims by other nations and prevents them from becoming accepted customary international law, the Department of Defense said in an annual report.\nSince the end of 2015, U.S. naval ships regularly sailed near disputed features in the South China Sea, as well as in the Taiwan Strait, to challenge the claims by not only China but also by others, such as Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan, that the U.S. views as inconsistent with UNCLOS.\nThe report's author considered FONOPs a form of strategic communication, or messages that are communicated to advance a strategic objective.\nThe idea is that the state will receive the message and either reconsider or change its course of action, Bennett wrote.\nHowever, despite the 46 reported FONOPs in the South China Sea from 2016 to 2023, China's responses became more oppositional over created_at.\nNot only did China use U.S. actions as justification for its own militarization, but it also made a thinly veiled threat of retaliation, the researcher said, citing statements by Chinese military officials and media reports.\nThe key factor that will determine whether a message will be accepted is the pre-existing relationship between the states, Bennett argued, and as China viewed the U.S. as a competitor and potential threat, it was predisposed to reject the U.S. communication, which is unlikely to bring about any change in Beijing's behavior.\nThis argument actually has been floating around since FONOPs started, said Collin Koh, senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, who recorded every FONOP by U.S. and allied vessels in the region.\nI think the whole idea, firstly, is to let China know it's created_at to roll back on its excessive maricreated_at claims, but notext has realistically expected to achieve Beijing's rolling back so it is a bit hasty to say it's unsuccessful, Koh told Radio Free Asia.\nChina would still conduct land reclamation and military exercises to exert control according to its plans and strategies, but the U.S. FONOPs had helped to deter Beijing's gray zone campaign of coercive pressure, he added.\nAn in-depth study is needed to reach conclusions, Koh said.\nSometext cares\nIn Koh's opinion, the U.S. strategic messaging is also intended to reassure countries in the region about Washington's stabilizing role, that is to say that there is sometext who cares.\nAt least one country acts for public common good and its actions should be appreciated by all countries facing China's aggression, Koh said.\nI don't think FONOPs are designed to stop Chinese aggression, said Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, or ASPI, a government think tank.\nThey are there to demonstrate to Beijing that the U.S. maintains the right to sail in international waters and challenges China's illegal claims to territory.\nOnly China has publicly and officially protested against the U.S. FONOPs that it sees as disruptive and a grave threat to China's sovereignty and security.\nIn her research, Bennett also noticed that the Philippines remained supportive of U.S. messaging and its media even adopted the rhetoric and justifications that the U.S. provided in support of the operations.\nMany would argue that [without the FONOPs] it would be more challenging to send clear, consistent messages to Beijing regarding international law and territorial disputes in the South China Sea, said Troy Lee-Brown, project manager of Blue Security and co-editor of Blue Security Maricreated_at Affairs Series.\nHowever, ultimately, as the author Nell Bennett points out, the effectiveness of FONOPs depends on how they are perceived.\nSo, there is a tension there between the two points of view on their efficacy, Lee-Brown told RFA.\nLee-Brown suggested that FONOPs should ideally be complimented by other forms of strategic communication - diplomatically, through statements and declarations, military presence and exercises with partners and allies, and legal and normative advocacy amongst other aspects.\nAnalysts also pointed out that the U.S. not being a party to UNCLOS presents challenges to its advocating a rules-based order in the South China Sea.\nHowever, the U.S. has consistently observed UNCLOS as customary international law and conducts operations in accordance with its principles, Lee-Brown added.\nASPI's Malcolm Davis said it's important that the U.S. maintains FONOPs and it's also important that other U.S. allies participate in one way or another, or, like Australia, undertake similar operations to demonstrate international law at sea.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "text": "\nThe US military has moved its Typhon launchers, which can fire multipurpose missiles up to thousands of kilometers, from Laoag airfield in the Philippines to another location on the island of Luzon, a senior Philippine government source said.\nThe Tomahawk cruise missiles in the launchers can hit targets in both China and Russia from the Philippines. The SM-6 missiles it also carries can strike air or sea targets more than 200 km (165 miles) away.\nThe senior Philippine government source said the redeployment would help determine where and how fast the missile battery could be moved to a new firing position. That mobility is seen as a way to make them more survivable during a conflict.\nSatellite images showed the batteries and their associated gear being loaded onto C-17 transport aircraft at Laoag International Airport in recent weeks, said Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. The white rain canopies that had covered the Typhon equipment were also removed, based on the images seen by Reuters.\nThe Typhon system is part of a US drive to amass a variety of anti- ship weapons in Asia.\nIndo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), which oversees US forces in the region, told Reuters the Typhons have been “relocated within the Philippines.” Both INDOPACOM and the Philippine government declined to give the specific location to which the batteries were moved.\n“The US government has coordinated closely with the Philippine government on every aspect of the MRC deployment, including the location,” said Commander Matthew Comer of INDOPACOM, referring to the Typhon by the initials of its formal name, mid-range capability.\nHe added that the relocation was not an indication that the batteries would remain permanently in the Philippines.\nThe weapon drew sharp criticism from China when it was first deployed in April 2024 during a training exercise. In September, when the US said it had no immediate plans to pull the Typhons out of the Philippines, China and Russia condemned the deployment as fueling an arms race.\nChina’s Foreign Ministry accused the Philippines on Thursday of creating tension and confrontation in the region, and urged it to “correct its wrong practices.”\n“(The deployment) is also an extremely irresponsible choice for the people of the country and various Southeast Asian countries, and for regional security,” ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a news briefing.\nTyphons are relatively easy to produce — drawing on large stockpiles and designs that have been around for a decade or more — and could help the US and its allies catch up quickly in an Indo-Pacific missile race in which China has a big lead.\nAlthough the US military has declined to say how many will be deployed in the Indo-Pacific region, more than 800 SM-6 missiles are due to be bought in the next five years, according to government documents outlining military purchases. Several thousand Tomahawks are already in US inventories, the documents showed.\nBoth missiles are Raytheon products.\n‘IRONCLAD COMMITMENTS’\nMeanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed China’s “dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea” with his Philippine counterpart on Wednesday and underscored the “ironclad” US defense commitment to Manila.\n“Secretary Rubio conveyed that (China’s) behavior undermines regional peace and stability and is inconsistent with international law,” the US State Department said in a statement on the call with Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique A. Manalo.\nThe two also discussed ways to boost security and economic ties between both countries for “further regional cooperation.”\nThe US is the Philippines’ major security partner, with a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty compelling both nations to defend each other in case of an armed attack.\nThe Philippines has been embroiled in wrangles at sea with China in the past two years and the two countries have faced off regularly around disputed features in the South China Sea that fall within Manila’s exclusive economic zone.\nMr. Rubio’s call came after he hosted counterparts from Australia, India and Japan in the China-focused “Quad” forum on Tuesday, the day after President Donald J. Trump returned to the White House. The four recommitted to working together.\nQuad members and the Philippines share concerns about China’s growing power and analysts said on Tuesday’s meeting was designed to signal continuity in the Indo-Pacific and that countering Beijing would be a top priority for Mr. Trump.\nIn the call with Mr. Manalo, Mr. Rubio “underscored the United States’ ironclad commitments to the Philippines” under their Mutual Defense Treaty and discussed ways to advance security cooperation, expand economic ties and deepen regional cooperation, according to the statement.\nChina’s Foreign Ministry said its activities in the waters were “reasonable, lawful and beyond reproach.”\nSpeaking at a regular press conference, Ms. Mao, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said the US was “not a party” to the South China Sea dispute, and had “no right to intervene” in maricreated_at issues between China and the Philippines.\n“Military cooperation between the US and the Philippines should not undermine China’s sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests in the South China Sea, nor should it be used to endorse the illegal claims of the Philippines,” she said.\nJust ahead of Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the Philippines and the US held their fifth set of joint maricreated_at exercises in the South China Sea since launching the exercises in 2023.\nSecurity engagements between the allies have soared under Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., who has moved closer to Washington and allowed the expansion of military bases that American forces could access, including facilities facing the democratically governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own.\nVisiting the Philippines last week, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said a trilateral initiative to boost cooperation launched by Japan, the US and the Philippines at a summit last year would be strengthened when the new US administration took over in Washington.\n“This is music to Manila’s ears as Washington supports us and rebukes Beijing’s inconsistent appreciation of international law,” Chester B. Cabalza, founding president at Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, said in a Facebook Messenger chat.\n“But the US and Philippines must work harder to maintain peace and order in the West Philippine Sea and ensure that China will not abuse its show of force and noncompliance with the 2016 arbitral award,” he added.\nAlso on Thursday, Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines Endo Kazuya said Japan would continue working with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to keep the rule-based order.\n“The world’s oceans are interconnected, and comprehensive international cooperation and partnership are necessary to address maricreated_at security issues in each sea area,” he said in a speech at a security forum in Manila. “We are committed to working with ASEAN countries and other concerned countries to maintain and strengthen the maricreated_at order based on the rule of law.”\n"

    "text": "\nManila, Jan 24 (EFE) - The arrest of an alleged Chinese spy in the Philippines, who allegedly mapped military bases to which the U.S. has access, has opened a new episode of friction between Beijing and Manila that adds to the tensions between them over territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\n\"Any indication\" of espionage \"is very serious,\" the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said Friday on the social network Facebook, before adding to be ready to support the ongoing investigation led by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the Department of Justice and the armed forces.\nThe NBI claimed last Monday in a statement that the alleged Chinese spy, Deng Yuanqing, and two other Filipino nationals accused of collaboration, \"conducted illegal surveillance and espionage\" in the Asian country.\nIn particular, Deng allegedly used \"advanced equipment\" installed in a vehicle to map and transmit detailed data on key defense structures in the Philippines.\nThese include military bases to which U.S. troops have access under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Compact (EDCA), the Asian country's Armed Forces chief Romeo Brawner Jr. said during a press conference on Monday.\nDeng, according to Philippine authorities, is affiliated with the Chinese People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology and his alleged activities were first detected last December.\nThe accusations irritated Beijing, which denied Manila's version. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning urged the Philippine authorities to \"stop peddling\" their theory of the alleged spy and \"seriously protect the legitimate rights and interests\" of their citizens.\nThe alleged spying case joins another case reported by Manila earlier this month. A group of fishermen found an underwater drone about three meters long with possible \"military applications,\" a Philippine Navy spokesman said last Jan. 7, the provenance of which is still under investigation.\nThese cases led an Asian Navy spokesman, Roy Vincent Trinidad, to affirm that \"there seems to be a deliberate and calculated plan to map\" the Philippines by a \"foreign power\", without directly mentioning China.\nManila and Beijing are in conflict over the sovereignty of territories in the South China Sea, a strategic region through which some 30% of global trade passes, which is home to 12% of the world's fishing grounds and has potential oil and gas reserves.\nThe main risk is that this region becomes the scene of a potential conflict between Beijing and Washington, because although the United States does not have any direct sovereignty dispute, it maintains a mutual defense pact with the Philippines.

The Feiyi can navigate underwater efficiently and perform high-agility maneuvers in the air, making it suitable for marine reconnaissance, surveillance and strike missions, the SCMP report said.\nFeiyi’s cutting-edge features, bolstered by China’s unmatched drone manufacturing network and its growing prowess in cross-media weaponry, signal a potential edge for China in future naval conflicts involving drones with the US.\nSimilarly, the US Navy is testing the Naviator drone, an unmanned vehicle capable of aerial and underwater operations. According to The War Zone, the Naviator is designed for autonomous launch and recovery from unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) and can transition seamlessly between air and water, enhancing its deployment flexibility.\n      Latest stories     \n                  \nFirst flex of Trump’s peace through strength strategy\n          \n                  \nMove over CHIPS Act, Stargate is the future\n          \n                  \nBank of Japan hikes rates with a wary eye on Trump\n          \nThe Naviator features precise GPS and visual position hold, a power-saving buoy sentry mode, the ability to carry various sensors and payloads and faster deployment than traditional underwater vehicles. The US Navy’s Orca Extra-Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV) could be a candidate for the Naviator’s possible launch platform.\nIts size and payload volume surpass those of most existing underwater vehicles, allowing for versatile mission profiles beyond minelaying operations. Its diesel-electric propulsion system enables autonomous operations for up to 30 days and 6,000 nautical miles, although operational testing is ongoing to refine these capabilities, according to The War Zone.\nThe tactical impact of these cross-media drones is that they can bypass multilayered defenses, possibly overcoming the limitations of conventional and hypersonic weapons, and overwhelm the enemy by swarming attacks from multiple domains and directions.\nFurther, these developments may tie into the more prominent “dronification” of undersea tensions in the Taiwan Strait, South China Sea and Indian Ocean.\nExploring the role of UUVs in the Taiwan Strait, the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) mentions in a June 2024 report that UUVs play a vital role in enhancing China’s maricreated_at surveillance and anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities.\nThese UUVs conduct covert intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) operations, monitor naval activities, map the seabed and locate critical undersea infrastructure. Their autonomous operations also reduce detection risks, making them effective in contested waters.\nBy integrating UUVs into its broader drone fleet, China is establishing a multidomain surveillance network that bolsters its ability to disrupt communications and counter foreign interventions. This move aligns with China’s strategy to offset conventional disadvantages and strengthen its position in potential Taiwan conflict scenarios.\nIn the 2024 book “Navigating East Asian Maricreated_at Conflicts: Technological Change, Environmental Challenges, Global and Regional Responses,” Henrik Hiim mentions that UUVs and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) play a nuanced role in US-China undersea competition in the South China Sea.\nChina uses UUVs to counter US nuclear attack submarines (SSN) by enhancing maricreated_at domain awareness, in line with its efforts to turn the South China Sea into a protected bastion for its nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBN).\nIn turn, the US uses Unmanned Maricreated_at Systems (UMS) to support strategic anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations in the South China Sea but is constrained by limited endurance and vulnerability in China’s A2/AD environment.\nSign up for one of our free newsletters\nHowever, Hiim argues that while UMSs may not decisively alter the undersea power balance, they exacerbate maricreated_at disputes, fueling US-China rivalry and intensifying the regional security dilemma.\nIn the Indian Ocean, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank mentions in a January 2024 report that China’s operations in the area are characterized by extensive dual-use research activities, blending scientific and military objectives.\nThe PLA leverages a vast fleet of civilian research vessels to gather critical data on water conditions, currents, and the seafloor, thereby enhancing its naval capabilities. These vessels, often owned by state-affiliated organizations with military ties, conduct surveys that support China’s strategic ambitions.\nNotably, Chinese ships have been active in the Indian Ocean, deploying advanced underwater gliders and profiling floats to build a real-created_at ocean observation network. This data collection could aid the PLA Navy’s (PLAN) submarine operations in the area to counter India’s bastion in the Bay of Bengal for its SSBNs.\nAnalysts have noted India could use its undersea nuclear deterrent as a backstop should its conventional military capabilities be overwhelmed in its ongoing border dispute with China in the Himalayas.\nThank you for registering!\nAn account was already registered with this email.

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Mao Ning urged Philippine authorities to \"stop selling\" their theory of the alleged spy and \"seriously protect the legitimate rights and interests\" of its citizens.\nThe incident comes amid another spying case reported by Manila at the beginning of the month. A group of fishermen found an underwater drone about three meters long with possible \"military applications,\" a spokesman for the Philippine navy said on Jan. 7, whose origin is still being investigated.\nSpokesman Roy Vincent Trinidad said \"there seems to be a deliberate and calculated plan to map\" the Philippines by a \"foreign power,\" without directly mentioning China.\nManila and Beijing are in conflict over the sovereignty of territories in the South China Sea, a strategic region through which approximately 30 percent of global trade passes, which houses 12 percent of the world's fishing grounds and has potential oil and gas reserves.\nThe main risk is that this region could become the scene of a potential conflict between Beijing and Washington, because although the US does not have any direct sovereignty dispute, it does have a mutual defense pact in force with the Philippines.

    "text": "\n2025 JAN 24 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Ecology Daily News -- New research on animal biotelemetry is the subject of a new report. According to news reporting from Niigata University by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The collection of wildlife tracking information throughout a species' entire life cycle is important for comprehensive ecological elucidation and the establishment of practical protected areas. Although streaked shearwater (SS) is a seabird species for which biologging techniques are highly developed, there have been no reports of successful global positioning system (GPS) tracking during the early breeding and non-breeding seasons, when recapture is difficult.\" \n Financial supporters for this research include Environment Research And Technology Development Fund of The Environmental Restoration And Conservation Agency of Japan; Japan Society For The Promotion of Science. \n Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Niigata University: \"In this study, we succeeded in long-term GPS tracking, obtaining highly accurate tracking data during the non-breeding season from November to March and the early breeding season from April to July. We discuss the relationship between prey distribution and the marine environment to understand the species' foraging habitat preferences. In September 2018, we attached GPS tags to birds breeding on Toshima, in the Izu Islands, and recaptured two birds in August 2020 and 2022. The tags worked for 277 and 549 days and fixed 23,510 and 37,233 positions, respectively. During the early breeding season, the foraging area had low sea surface temperatures (SST) and high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations and moved northward as the season progressed. During the non-breeding season, one bird wintered in the South China Sea and the other off northern New Guinea. In the South China Sea, SS preferred sea areas with an average SST of 26 °C and high Chl-a concentrations (> 0.8mg/m3), whereas off northern New Guinea, SS preferred an area with an average SST of 29 °C. The foraging area used during the early breeding season depended on the optimal water temperature zone for their primary prey-Japanese Anchovy.\" \n According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The foraging areas used during the non-breeding season matched the optimal water temperature zones of the main fish distributed in each sea area. The GPS tracking data obtained in this study, while not a statistically sufficient sample size, are valuable and provide new insights into the environmental preferences of SS during early breeding and non-breeding seasons; life stages for which little information is available.\" \n For more information on this research see: Case report: Long-term GPS tracking throughout the breeding and non-breeding seasons of the streaked shearwater Calonectris leucomelas.

Marcos Jr.'s firm policy on safeguarding Philippine sovereignty.\nAccording to a news release from his office on Friday, Romualdez issued the statement during the Stakeholder Dialogue titled 'Navigating Asia's Hotspots' at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2025 in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday (local created_at).\n'President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has been very, very firm on his policy that we should not give an inch of any Philippine territory,' Romualdez said.\n'Having that been said, we celebrate, of course, our rules-based global order, and with the [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea] and the 2016 arbitral award recognizing the sovereignty of the Philippines, we stand steadfast with the President's policy in enforcing that,' he added.\nHe was joined in the panel by Timor-Leste President Jose Ramos Horta and Indonesia Foreign Minister Sugiono; Michael Froman, president of the Council on Foreign Relations; and Tulsi Naidu, chief executive officer of Asia-Pacific at Zurich Insurance Group.\nRomualdez emphasized that the Philippines has adopted a pragmatic and balanced approach to navigating the intensifying geopolitical competition between the United States and China, particularly in relation to the South China Sea (SCS) issue.\nBalancing geopolitical interests\nDuring the dialogue, Romualdez underscored the Philippines' strategic position as an ally of the US and a vital trade partner of China, and advocated for leveraging both relationships to advance the country's national interests.\nHe emphasized that the territorial dispute in the SCS does not define the entirety of the country's relationship with China.\n'Despite the President being very firm on this policy of not giving up a single inch, we are working daily to de-escalate tensions. We do not want the South China Sea dispute to overshadow the many other facets of our relationship with China, including trade, education, and cultural exchanges,' Romualdez said.\n'We are not taking sides. The United States is our long-standing ally and China is our largest trading partner. The Philippines is navigating a middle path where we maximize opportunities from both relationships while actively participating in the broader global community,' he added.\nOn the bilateral ties with the US, Romualdez welcomed recent reassurances from new Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the Mutual Defense Treaty and Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, noting their alignment with the Philippines' strategic priorities.\nReports said that in a call with his Philippine counterpart, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo, Rubio 'underscored the United States' ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defense Treaty.'\n'Our enduring alliance with the United States strengthens our ability to safeguard sovereignty and pursue peace. At the same created_at, we remain proactive in fostering relationships with all nations to promote global collaboration,' he said.\nEconomic growth, global engagement\nRomualdez likewise highlighted the economic benefits of the country's pragmatic foreign policy, noting its attractiveness to investors due to its robust gross domestic product (GDP) growth, youthful workforce, and strategic location within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n'We are here at the WEF to tell the Philippine story -- of a nation full of potential and resilience. As part of ASEAN, we are at the heart of a dynamic growth region, and we are working to build stronger partnerships to unlock opportunities for trade and investment,' he said.\nHe emphasized how the Indo-Pacific region is emerging as a key hub for global trade, citing as example the Philippine government's engagements with industrial leaders from India.\nCommitment to peace, cooperation\nReiterating the Philippines' role in fostering regional stability, Romualdez affirmed the nation's dedication to the ASEAN centrality and multilateralism.\n'ASEAN continues to play a vital role in ensuring regional peace and stability. The Philippines remains committed to this multilateral framework, which has proven effective in addressing challenges while promoting cooperation,' he said.\nHe reiterated the Philippines' commitment to a balanced and pragmatic foreign policy, rooted in upholding sovereignty, fostering economic growth, and pursuing peaceful international collaboration.\n'Our future lies in de-escalating tensions, building meaningful partnerships, and safeguarding our principles. The Philippines is prepared to navigate the complexities of geopolitics, ensuring that our people benefit from peace, prosperity, and stability,' he said.\n"

    "text": "\nBy Alimat Aliyeva\nThe British government has signed an $11 billion contract with Rolls-Royce to build nuclear reactors for submarines as part of its submarine fleet modernization program, Azernews reports.\nThe Unity deal provides for the \"design, manufacture, and support of nuclear reactors\" for the United Kingdom's submarines.\nThis new contract with Rolls-Royce, as noted in London, is expected to enhance the United Kingdom's security and further strengthen the partnership within the AUKUS alliance, which was established in 2021 and consists of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.\nUnder this partnership, military cooperation is planned in two main areas. The first involves providing Australia with a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines (SSNs). The UK plans to begin building a series of SSN-AUKUS submarines, which will eventually be adopted by both British and Australian navies. British companies BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce will collaborate with Australian shipbuilder ASC Pty Ltd to build these submarines.\nAfter 2030, the construction of these submarines will shift to Australia, with the first submarine set to be delivered in the early 2040s. In the meancreated_at, Australia will bolster its submarine fleet with three Virginia-class submarines purchased from the United States.\nThe second area of cooperation involves the joint development of military technologies across eight critical sectors, including underwater systems, quantum technologies, artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, cybersecurity and electronic warfare, hypersonic aircraft and interception systems, as well as innovations in information exchange technologies.\nThis deal highlights the growing defense collaboration between the AUKUS nations, signaling a strong shift in global military alliances in response to rising geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific region. The AUKUS partnership, aimed at countering China's growing military presence, particularly in the South China Sea, will not only reshape the region's naval capabilities but also push forward technological advancements in areas like AI and hypersonic weapons. For Rolls-Royce, this contract is a major win, reinforcing its position as a leader in defense technology, particularly in the nuclear propulsion sector. Furthermore, the strategic importance of the Unity deal may have long-term implications for the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific and the development of cutting-edge military technology.\n"

It is said the United States and China are locked competing on the world stage, with newly-appointed Donald Trump supposedly working on security alliances and Beijing working on financial dominance.\nIn Trump's various presidential vows, he has threatened a possible new 10% tariff on Chinese goods. World leaders believe this move could reignite a trade war and increase tensions even further.\nSpeaking to the National University of Singapore's University Cultural Centre on Tuesday, Wong touched upon trade in South-East Asia. The South China Sea, which China claims, has been at the centre of territorial disputes involving countries like Vietnam and the Philippines.\nThe U.S. completes navigation exercises in the area to challenge China's claims, which Beijing strongly opposes.\n\"If the U.S. were to cut themselves off from China, it will be very damaging for the U.S. economy and for American citizens,\" Wong said. \"So much of what the U.S. manufactures and produces and imports for its people comes from China, so I can't see how a full decoupling can happen at this stage.\"\nHowever, he said this could be unlikely due to their interdependence, which neither can escape. In fact, Chinese officials have responded to Trump's tariff proposal.

    "text": "\n A Chinese Coast Guard vessel prowling waters off Zambales has moved from 65 to 80-90 nautical miles offshore after the \"strategic maneuvering\" of a Philippine patrol vessel. Still, it remains within Philippine territory despite persistent radio challenges from the Philippine side.\nBRP Cabra - a Parola-class patrol vessel of the Philippine Coast Guard - continues its \"vigilant monitoring\" of CCG 3103's illegal presence within the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), PCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela said in a statement on Thursday evening, January 23.\n\"The strategic maneuvering of BRP Cabra has effectively kept CCG-3103 from getting closer to the coastline of Zambales,\" he added.\nThe PCG spokesperson attributed the partial retreat of the Chinese vessel to the \"seamanship skills of the PCG personnel abroad.\" It was last spotted approximately 80 to 90 nautical miles off the coast of Zambales, well within the country's 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone.\nThe crew of the BRP Cabra has issued hourly radio challenges to remind the Chinese vessel of its violations of Philippine maricreated_at law and international conventions, Tarriela added.\nBRP Cabra took over patrol duties from BRP Suluan on Wednesday, January 23. During the handover, a second Chinese vessel, CCG-3304, appeared briefly before withdrawing - a move the PCG interpreted as anticipating additional Philippine deployments.\nThe 77-meter CCG-3103 - which dwarfs the 44-meter BRP Cabra - is part of China's rotating fleet of vessels stationed in the waters off Zambales since the start of the year. While this area has not been a traditional flashpoint between both countries, it is near Scarborough Shoal, where Beijing has been restricting access since taking control in 2012.\nThe shoal, just 124 nautical miles from Zambales, is a rich fishing ground that a 2016 international tribunal ruled should remain open to Filipino fishermen.\nChina's sustained presence off Zambales, which entered its 19th day on Thursday, began when its Coast Guard sent its largest vessel just 54 nautical miles from Capones Island on January 4.\nThe 12,000-ton vessel's unprecedented proximity to the Philippine coastline had alarmed Philippine officials. The Department of Foreign Affairs has since filed a diplomatic protest to call on China to withdraw its vessels.\nFishermen's plight\nLocal fishermen have reported growing unease over China's maricreated_at presence. Leonardo Cuaresma, who chairs the Federated Association of Fisherfolk in Masinloc, said in a radio interview earlier this week that fishing communities are operating with increased caution due to the presence of Chinese vessels.\nThe fisherfolk leader said tensions have been heightened by the mysterious disappearance of several local fishermen last month under calm weather conditions. While no evidence links Chinese vessels to the disappearances, fishing communities have not dismissed possible encounters with foreign ships, he said.\nChina's increasing incursions into the Philippines' EEZ are part of its broader actions in the South China Sea, where it claims historic rights to almost all waters through its \"nine-dash line.\" An international tribunal invalidated this claim in 2016.\n"

    "text": "\nStories being covered today by BBC Monitoring from Chinese broadcast, press and social media sources.\nChina refuses to confirm plan for a phone call with Rubio\nChinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said that she has \"no information to share\" when asked if Beijing plans to speak to new US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\nAt the regular press conference on 23 January, Mao reiterated an earlier comment that it is \"necessary for high-level Chinese and US officials to engage each other in appropriate ways\" and that China will \"firmly defend its national interest\", state-run nationalist daily Global created_ats reported.\nMao, however, offered a more detailed response to a question about Rubio's phone call with Philippine Foreign Minister Enrique Manalo on 22 January, where they discussed China's \"dangerous and destabilising actions in the South China Sea\".\n\"China's activities in relevant waters are legitimate, lawful, and fully justified,\" Mao said, as she added that US-Philippine military cooperation \"should not undermine China's sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests\" and that Beijing will \"continue to take necessary steps\" to safeguard its \"territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights\" and uphold peace and stability in the South China Sea.\nOn another question about the US military redeploying the Typhon missile system to a new location in the Philippines, Mao criticised Manila for \"essentially creating tensions and antagonism in the region\" and called for it to \"correct the wrongdoing\" and remove the system as soon as possible, Global created_ats reported.\nMeanwhile, the Chinese commerce ministry reiterated China's position on Trump's tariff threats, saying that it is \"neither beneficial to China and US nor to the whole world\", official Xinhua News Agency reported.\nOn Trump's remarks that America should hold 50% of TikTok ownership, the ministry said it \"opposes moves that violate basic principles of market economy and undermine legitimate interests of companies\" and asked Washington to provide companies from all countries, including Chinese ones, a \"fair and just business environment\".\nSee also: Briefing: Taiwan's media, pundits divided on what Trump return means for Taipei  \nBriefing: China concerned over US leaving Paris accord, more optimistic on ties  \nChina sidesteps question on lifting sanctions on Rubio, stresses 'high-level' contact  \nBeijing condemns killing of Chinese national in Afghanistan&#160;\nChina has lodged \"serious protests\" with Afghanistan following the killing of a Chinese national in the north of the country and demanded a \"thorough investigation\" to bring the perpetrators to justice.\nResponding to questions about the Islamic State (IS) group claiming responsibility for the attack, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular media briefing on 23 January that China was \"deeply shocked\" and \"strongly condemns\" the killing.&#160;\nShe emphasised China's firm opposition to \"all forms of terrorism\" and called for \"resolute and strong efforts\" to combat groups such as the IS and the Xinjiang separatist group East Islamic Turkestan Movement (ETIM, also known as the Turkistan Islamic Party or TIP), which are designated terrorist organisations by the UN Security Council.\nMao pledged China's continued support for Afghanistan in fighting terrorism and urged the Taliban interim government to \"ensure the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions and projects\" in the country.\nTwo groups have claimed responsibility for the attack that led to the death of the Chinese national. The Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) stated on 22 January that it killed a \"Chinese communist\" using machine guns in Takhar's Kakjar area. Separately, the National Mobilisation Front (NMF), a little-known anti-Taliban armed group, alleged it killed a Chinese \"mentor\" who was providing intelligence training to the Taliban.\nChinese media, however, noted that it was a Chinese worker at an Afghan mining company.\nAccording to Xinhua, the victim was shot dead on 21 January in Dasht Qala district, Takhar province. Provincial police Spokesperson Mohammad Akbar Haqqani stated to the agency that the incident was under investigation and \"the cause of the incident remains unclear\".\nThe incident notably occurred a day after the Taliban-run foreign ministry commemorated 70 years of diplomatic relations with Beijing.\nSee also: Briefing: Chinese national killed in north Afghanistan amid growing investment  \nEmbassy in Afghanistan to monitor reported killing of Chinese national  \nChina urges Thailand, Myanmar to crack down on telecom crimes\nChina has urged Thailand and Myanmar to step up a crackdown on cross-border telecom fraud following a series of high-profile cases of Chinese citizens being rescued from captivity in telecoms fraud camps run by criminal gangs.\nLiu Jinsong, director-general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry Department of Asian Affairs, made the appeal when meeting Thai Ambassador to China Chatchai Viriyavejakul and Ambassador of Myanmar to China Tin Maung Swe separately on 22 January, Xinhua News Agency reported.\nLiu expressed concerns that a series of recent \"vicious cases\" of telecoms fraud in the border region between Myanmar and Thailand affected the safety of Chinese citizens. He said China is willing to strengthen bilateral and multilateral law enforcement cooperation with Asean countries.\nEarlier on 21 January, the Lancang-Mekong Law Enforcement Cooperation Centre announced during a conference in China's border province of Yunnan that more than 70,000 people had been arrested in electronic fraud cases under the \"Seagull\" joint operation between August and December 2024, China Central Television (CCTV) reported. Over 160 victims had also been rescued during the period.\nThe \"Seagull\" initiative involved law enforcement departments from China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.\nChinese news websites also widely reposted a video of Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra who, speaking in Mandarin aided by AI, reassured Chinese tourists that the country was safe to visit as holiday bookings have dropped in the wake of the recent rescue of Chinese actor Wang Xing, who was kidnapped in Thailand and brought to a cyber-fraud camp in Myanmar.&#160;\nSee also: More Chinese rescued after 3 January kidnap of actor in Thailand  \nBriefing: China's Spring Festival travel rush gets under way  \nMedia subdued on death sentence for Chinese man in Japanese attack\nA court in the city of Suzhou sentenced a Chinese man to death for a knife attack that injured a Japanese mother and child and killed a Chinese bus guide last year.\nWhile the verdict announced by the Suzhou Intermediate People's Court on 23 January received wide coverage in Hong Kong and Taiwan media, it was notably subdued in mainland Chinese media.&#160;\nAt a regular press briefing later that day, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning avoided commenting directly on the sentence, stating that judicial authorities would handle the case according to the law. She reiterated China's commitment to protecting the safety of foreign nationals.\nThe attack occurred on 24 June, when the man, aged in his 50s, assaulted the Japanese pair waiting for a school bus.&#160;\nCiting Kyodo, Hong Kong-based state affiliated Phoenix TV briefly noted the lack of details on charges and motives, while adding that the man, \"unemployed and without family\", had travelled to Suzhou and felt \"deeply lonely\".&#160;\nThe case, along with a fatal September stabbing of a 10-year-old Japanese schoolboy in Shenzhen, heightened safety concerns among Japanese nationals in China.&#160;\nTaiwan's United Daily News newspaper added that Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi had called the crime \"no way justifiable\" and urged China to safeguard Japanese citizens.\nSee also: Briefing: Japanese pupil stabbed as China marks sensitive war anniversary  \nBriefing: Heightened security after 35 killed in car ramming attack in China  \nSource: BBC Monitoring, 24 Jan 25\n"

    "text": "\nThe United States has reportedly moved a missile system, which had been deployed in the Philippines since last April, to a new site.\nNewsweek has contacted the Pentagon and the Armed Forces of the Philippines by email for comment. The Chinese military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nThe Mid-Range Capability (MRC) missile system can fire the Tomahawk cruise missile and the Standard Missile 6, with respective ranges of 1,000 and 290 miles. The former can hit targets at sea and on land, while the latter conducts anti-air and anti-surface missions.\nLast spring, the U.S. Army deployed an MRC, also known as Typhon, to ally the Philippines for drills, but it was decided to keep it there \"indefinitely.\" China, which has territorial disputes with Manila in the South China Sea, has repeatedly objected to the deployment.\nWhat To Know\nThe Typhon missile system was redeployed from its original site at Laoag airfield on the island of Luzon in the northern Philippines to another location on the island, Reuters reported on Thursday. Tomahawk missiles can strike eastern and southern China from Laoag.\nSatellite imagery also captured a U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane at Laoag, to be used in relocating the missile system, as early as December 30 last year. A January 8 satellite image showed the missile system was no longer at the airfield.\nA senior Philippine government source told Reuters that the Typhon's relocation would help determine \"where and how fast the missile battery could be moved to a new firing position.\" Such mobility is seen as a way to make the missile system more survivable in a conflict, the report added.\nU.S. Indo-Pacific Command confirmed the relocation to Reuters but declined to give the specific location. The command, which is responsible for U.S. forces in the region, said the relocation did not indicate the Typhon would be in the Philippines permanently.\nThe Philippine Army confirmed to the country's GMA News Online that the missile system will be employed in an upcoming bilateral exercise with its American counterpart. The exercise, code-named Salaknib, is aimed increasing readiness, reinforcing interoperability and strengthening relationships, according to the U.S. military.\nMao Ning, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said that the Typhon is a strategic offensive weapon and its deployment in the Philippines is a \"highly dangerous move.\"\nWhat People Are Saying\nU.S. Indo-Pacific Command spokesperson Commander Matthew Comer told Reuters: \"The U.S. government has coordinated closely with the Philippine government on every aspect of the MRC deployment, including the location.\"\nPhilippine Army spokesperson Colonel Louie Dema-ala told GMA News Online: \"There will be trainings to be conducted utilizing the [Mid-Range Capability missile system] as part of the subject matter expert exchanges in preparation for the Salaknib.\"\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press conference: \"We once again call on the Philippines to heed the call from regional countries and their peoples, correct the wrongdoing as soon as possible, quickly pull out the Typhon missile system as publicly pledged, and stop going further down the wrong path.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nIt remains to be seen how long the missile system will be stationed in the Philippines and whether it will conduct live-fire tests to validate its capability of striking a moving target.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nU.S. Deploys Mid-Range Capability Missile Launcher\nCaptain Ryan DeBooy/US Army\nA United States Army Mid-Range Capability missile launcher is loaded into a U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane as part of its first deployment into theater at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in state of Washington on April 4, 2024.\n"

    "text": "\nKUALA LUMPUR: PRIME Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim made an indelible mark at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2025 in Davos, Switzerland.\nHe seamlessly navigated discussions that ranged from light-hearted conversations about his favourite football club to the intricate dynamics of international relations and challenges and successes of regional integration.\nHis ability to balance the conversation in his engagements showcased Malaysia's unique position in global diplomacy, especially in dealing with countries with varying political ideologies and economic policies.\nHis first engagement at the WEF came from none other than Manchester United Football Club co-chairman Avram Glazer regarding Malaysia's goal for sports in future.\nAnwar firstly replied that as a fan of the 147-year-old club, he still had hopes for Manchester United's resurgence and refused to change his preference despite the club languishing in the bottom half of the table and all his 14 grandchildren being Arsenal supporters.\nResponding to Glazer's question during the \"Country Strategy Dialogue\" session on the sidelines of the WEF Annual Summit 2025, he pointed out the significance of sports in a multi-religious country like Malaysia and the importance of promoting it, not only as an industry but also to use the game to foster unity.\nAnwar, who is also finance minister, addressed questions on the restructuring of Malaysia Airlines as well as improvements at Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, including aerotrain upgrades.\n\"I am impatient to get things going (at the airport) and (for it) to be more efficient. There's no reason why the airport should function as it did in the past, although it is relatively good compared with poorer airports. I think there's room for improvement,\" he said.\nOther topics Anwar touched on were healthcare, artificial intelligence, the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone, upgrading the country's legislative, free trade agreements and the need for these agreements to include digitalisation, as well as Malaysia's views on nuclear energy.\nOn the last day of his three-day working visit to Davos to attend the summit, Anwar touched on the issue of Myanmar and how the failure of governance in the state has affected peace and security in Asean.\nAs Asean chair, Malaysia was cautiously optimistic about the progress in Myanmar, and it would coordinate efforts towards peace and security with the United Nations, he said at the AseanÂ Plenary entitled \"Even Stronger Together\" here.\nAnwar's ability to navigate various topics on multiple platforms with consistency showcased the great orator he is.\nAt every opportunity, he emphasised Malaysia's commitment to fostering cooperation among major powers, ultimately reinforcing Asean's role in addressing pressing economic and geopolitical challenges.\nIn his no-holds-barred remarks on issues faced by AseanÂ and the region, especially concerning tensions in the South China Sea, Anwar firmly stated any resolution on the matter must be a collaborative solution and not otherwise, regardless of the Western world's views on it.\n\"We have unresolved issues with Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines. (But) why is it that the problem only seems to be with China?\" he said.\n\"And they say, 'Oh, are you being defensive?' No, it's not the case. I am simply stating the facts. Is there a problem? Yes, there is (a problem). But the issue involves the entire region. Are we going to wage war over it? No,\" he added.\nHe said these matters must not be approached defensively but with a firm commitment to dialogue, and Malaysia has been proactive in taking that path.\nHe said Malaysia had made significant strides in establishing itself as a trusted partner of China while recognising the United States as an equally important partner, as cumulatively, it remains the largest investor in Malaysia.\nAnwar expressed optimism about Malaysia's ability to continuously attract investments and took every opportunity to promote the country to government and business leaders, as well as civil society officials attending the WEF.

    "created_at": "2025-01-24",
    "text": "\n\"Brezhnev took Afghanistan, Begin took Beirut and Galtieri took the Union Jack\". Circa 1983, Roger Waters offered some incisive commentary on the geopolitical fun and games of the '80s. The Soviet Union was into the fourth year of the occupation of Afghanistan. Israel had waltzed into Lebanon, and enabled two bloody massacres in Palestinian refugee camps. Argentina under General Galtieri had occupied The Falkland Islands and the UK had recaptured the Falklands.\n Iran, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, and Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, were doing their best to wipe each other's nations off the map. The US was trying to covertly destabilise Nicaragua and would invade Panama a few years later.\n India and Pakistan had a short, vicious scuffle on the Saltoro Glacier. There was also the debacle of the IPKF expedition to Sir Lanka, and the successful counter-coup in the Maldives that restored an India-friendly government. India and China also had a face-off up in the mountains during the 1980s.\n The decade was also marked by the so-called \"Star Wars\". This was an American effort to bankrupt the USSR by pretending to develop space-based weapons. The weapons were science-fictional in concept and about as fantastical as the swag displayed onscreen in the eponymous movie franchise. The plan worked. The USSR did go bankrupt under the stress of fighting an unwinnable war in Afghanistan, and investing vast sums into research & development of futuristic weapons. There was also double-digit inflation in the US and much of the Western world, and there was the Black Monday crash of October 1987, when the Dow Jones fell over 20 per cent in a single session.\n Four decades later, the world might be headed for another period of similar fun and games. The new US President in his inaugural speech said he wanted to end ongoing conflicts and be remembered for the \"wars we never get into\". But he also said he wants to take over Greenland and the Panama Canal, and Canada, and he won't rule out the use of force to further these ambitions. Go figure.\n Russia is now into the 11th year of trying to annex Ukrainian territory by force. Israel has attacked Gaza, the West Bank, and bombed Syria, Lebanon and Iran. China has repeatedly reiterated its territorial claims on Taiwan, large parts of the South China Sea, Arunachal Pradesh, Ladakh, and chunks of Bhutan.\n  Territorial ambitions are a zero-sum game. As Mark Twain once pointed out in the context of buying real estate, \"They're not making land anymore\".  When one nation wants to extend its boundaries, another nation usually objects on the grounds that its territory would shrink correspondingly. This can, and often does, result in violent conflict. Unlike in the 1980s, there are at least nine nations with nuclear weapons in the game circa 2025, which increases the threat if conflict escalates.\n Another thing that usually results from conflict, or the threat of conflict is inflation. Supply chains break down. Essential commodities are diverted to the military effort. Energy prices spike. If people are conscripted in large numbers, there's a shortage of labour to do normal things like farm, work on assembly lines, drive buses, or fry pakodas. During World War I, this shortage led to the emancipation of women, who had to willy-nilly do these jobs and leveraged their foothold in the workforce into gaining the vote. During World War II, it led to full employment in the US that ended the lingering effects of the Great Depression.  But another round of extended inflation could have horrific effects in 2025, following a pandemic that triggered supply chain disruptions and inflation.\n The US also seems to be looking to push China into a techno-economic battle by cutting off the supply of high-end chips, and imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. Unlike in the 1980s, this isn't necessarily a battle the US will win. China is an economic powerhouse. Moreover, tariffs will hurt US consumers and industry, who will actually pay the enhanced costs.\n However, the global economy is collateral damage. Growth has slowed everywhere at the mere threat of more conflict, and inflation has spiked along with currency volatility. Investors have to reboot strategies and rework asset allocations. A flight to safety may be an instinctive reaction, but it's probably wrong. Debt loses value during inflationary periods; equity gains if investors can ride out the storm.\n"

    "text": "\nKUALA LUMPUR(The Star/ANN) - IT'S not exactly the best start, but there is still created_at for Pete Hegseth, President Donald Trump's choice for Defence Secretary, to learn and catch up.\nThe United States army veteran and popular conservative television personality found himself unable to state the number of Asean member countries.\nHe was grilled by Senator Tammy Duckworth during a recent Senate confirmation hearing regarding his appointment.\nDuckworth put Hegseth on the hot seat, questioning whether he had the \"breadth and depth of knowledge\" needed to lead international negotiations.\nHegseth was asked if he could name one member of Asean, describe what type of agreement the US had with the countries, and how many nations were in the bloc.\nThe fumbling Hegseth reportedly said he couldn't tell Duckworth the exact number of Asean nations but added, \"I know we have allies in South Korea and Japan in AUKUS (a pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the US) with Australia.\"\n\"None of those three countries are in Asean. I suggest you do a little homework,\" responded Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, as reported by AP.\nIt is no surprise that a top member of the Trump administration, like Hegseth, faces concerns, as there have been worries that the boss himself may not be keen on Southeast Asia.\nAsean is made up of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. An 11th country, East Timor, is set to join soon.\nMalaysia is the new chairman of Asean from Jan 1 and over 300 meetings, at various levels, have been scheduled.\nSet up in 1967, Asean's goal is to promote regional economic and security cooperation, leveraging a combined population of more than 670 million people with a gross domestic product of more than USD3tril.\nAccording to news reports, Duckworth's question came after Hegseth noted the strategic importance of the Indo-Pacific, a region where China's influence has been rapidly growing.\nThe multiple maricreated_at claims over the South China Sea, an important waterway, have also been in the spotlight.\nHowever, despite these territorial disputes, most Asean members maintain close relations with China, which remains a key trading partner. It helps that China is geographically closer to Asean than the US.\nChina shares the same created_at zone with Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei, for example, fostering strong people-to-people ties.\nTop Chinese officials are also expected to attend the upcoming Asean meetings.\nAttention will also be on the Asean, Council of Gulf Countries and China - the first such trilateral meeting.\nFor the US, it has treaty pacts with Thailand and the Philippines, with Washington being sought to harness Asean's regional influence and its emphasis on ensuring the region remains a zone of neutrality.\nCertainly, given the complexities of geopolitics and superpower rivalries, Asean does not want any one major power dominating the region.\nHegseth will be required to attend meetings of Asean defence ministers, while Marco Rubio, as Secretary of State, will meet the Asean foreign ministers.\nThe annual Asean summit has been attended by both Biden and Trump previously. Asean also conducts separate meetings with the leaders of China, South Korea, Japan, Australia, India, and New Zealand, as well as the East Asia Summit, which includes these six plus Russia and the US.\nMany analysts share the perception that Asean may not be Trump's priority.\nHoang Thi Ha and William Choong wrote that during Trump's first term, his attendance \"appeared driven more by specific circumstances than dedicated interest in the region itself, as seen under Obama, or the strategic focus on Southeast Asia's role in US-China competition under Biden.\"\n\"Trump 2.0 will be preoccupied with the challenge of delivering his campaign promises to swiftly end the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East.\n\"Given Trump's personal disinterest in the region as well as his scepticism towards multilateralism, the region may face another four years of Trump's absence at Asean summits and minimal direct engagement with Southeast Asian leaders.\"\nDuring his first term, Trump attended only the 2017 Asean summit meetings, failed to send a cabinet-level official to subsequent summits in 2019 and 2020, and failed to appoint US ambassadors to Asean and Singapore.\nBut Trump is a businessman and strategist, too. He would surely see that Asean is a region of over 670 million people with a GDP of over USD3tril.\nAsean's economy is projected to grow by over 5% per year to become the world's fourth-largest economy by 2030, as well as the US' fourth-largest export market in the world.\nThe bloc contains some of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with Asean playing an integral role in East Asian regionalism.\nThat should be enough reason for Trump and his officials to pay more attention to Asean.\n"

    "text": "\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio hit the ground running in his new job on Tuesday, hosting the foreign affairs ministers of Australia, Japan and India only hours after being sworn-in as America's new top diplomat by Vice President J.D. Vance.\nAlong with the United States, the three countries form the Quad grouping, which was revived under the first Trump presidency and was a pillar of the Biden administration's efforts to counter China.\nRubio, a former senator from Florida, was confirmed by his erstwhile Senate colleagues in a unanimous vote Monday evening after Donald Trump's inauguration as president earlier in the day, with Vance making the appointment official at the White House on Tuesday morning.\nHe then headed to the State Department in Washington's Foggy Bottom to greet staff members, promising to make changes to the department. But he said the changes would not prove destructive or punitive to those who worked for the Biden administration.\nIn our republic, the voters decide the course of our nation - both domestically and abroad - and they have elected Donald J. Trump as our president, Rubio said, adding that the new president had laid out a very clear mission on foreign policy during his campaign.\nThat mission, he said, is to ensure that our foreign policy is centered on one thing, and that is the advancement of our national interest.\nRepeating a line he used multiple created_ats during his confirmation hearing, America's new top diplomat defined such a foreign policy as anything that makes us stronger or safer or more prosperous.\nThe more things change...\nOne area where U.S. foreign policy does not look destined to diverge too sharply from that of the Biden administration is in the priority given to the Quad, a grouping formally convened in 2007 but which largely laid dormant until being revived under Trump a decade later.\nLed by former U.S. President Joe Biden's Asia czar, Kurt Campbell, the informal security grouping turned into one of the centerpieces of the Biden administration's strategic approach to China's military rise.\nRubio signaled the high priority on Quad is set to continue under the Trump administration, hosting Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya only an hour after greeting his new staff.\nAfter a meeting that lasted about a half-hour, the four officials posed for photographers in front of a display of their countries' flags at the State Department, but Rubio declined to respond to questions shouted from reporters before ushering the group away for further meetings.\nIt was a new look for the grouping, with Rubio not the only fresh face.\nIwaya - who previously served as Japan's defense minister - only took on his new role in early October as part of a change in government in Tokyo caused by Fumio Kishida's resignation as prime minister.\nTop priority\nDespite the officials' silence at the photoshoot, leaders of the Quad countries have recently appeared at pains to highlight the importance of the grouping going forward, even as their governments change.\nChina has derided the Quad as a relic of what it calls a U.S.-driven Cold War mindset and insisted that it has no designs for territorial expansion or aggression in the vast Indo-Pacific region.\nBut concerns remain in Washington, Tokyo and New Delhi about China's plans for parts of the South China Sea it claims - contra to international court rulings - as its territory, as well as for the democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a rogue province.\nShowing the importance placed on the grouping in Washington's efforts to counter China's military rise, the three other Quad foreign ministers each also attended Trump's inauguration on Monday.\nWong told reporters in Washington on Sunday that Australia's relationship with the United States was its most important strategic relationship, with the Quad grouping at the forefront of ties.\nIt's a demonstration of the collective commitment of all countries to the Quad, an iron-clad commitment in this created_at where close cooperation in the Indo-Pacific is so important, Wong said of the invitations extended to the foreign ministers by both Trump and Rubio this week.\nSpeaking in Canberra hours before the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5, India's Jaishankar also said he believed Washington would continue to prioritize the Quad no matter who won the vote.\nI remind you that actually the Quad was revived under a Trump presidency in 2017, Jaishankar said at the created_at, noting the group even held in-person talks in the earliest days of the COVID-19 pandemic. That should tell you something about the prospects of it.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-24",
    "text": "\nIndia, Jan. 24 -- The first multilateral meeting of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was QUAD with Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya. The first bilateral meeting of the Trump administration was with India on January 21 after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's special envoy Jaishankar was accorded top protocol at the Trump inaugural.\nOn January 26, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will be the chief guest at the Republic Day Parade. He will be accompanied by Navy Chief Admiral Muhammed Ali for the three-day trip after Indian Navy Chief Admiral Dinesh Tripathi visited Jakarta last month. A 160 men's tri-services contingent along with a 60-man band will also march on Kartavya Path on Republic Day.\nLast September, the first woman US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti declared that America needs to militarily prepare for the China challenge on Taiwan in 2027.\nWhile Indonesia wants to play the balancing role in the Indo-Pacific with the 'Friends with all and malice towards none' line, the geographical location of the fourth most populous country in the world places it in the midst of the Indo-Pacific. Indonesia sits on all the major ingress routes to the South China Sea with control over Malacca, Sunda, Lombok and Ombai-Wetar straits, stretching from QUAD partners India to Australia.\nJoin the three dots together and you get the big picture of the Indo-Pacific and the challenge faced by the rapidly expanding Chinese Navy. Even though the QUAD meeting in Washington was a broad overview, the meeting itself was a signal to the Indo-Pacific and all resident powers, particularly China.\nChina today has the largest Navy in the world with nearly 500 warships. The PLA Navy has cornered the majority of the Chinese defence budget for the past three years. For the first created_at, Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun is an ex-Admiral of the PLA Navy. China has added a full Indian Navy strength of 135 warships in the past decade and today has a permanent presence in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) with at least 6-7 warships in the littoral states at any given point in created_at. Chinese long-range carrier task force patrols are expected in the Indian Ocean Region as early as 2025 end.\nGiven the state of play, the QUAD summit may be hosted by India in the first half of 2025 even though the dates are still to be finalized. With trillions of dollars worth trade passing through the Indo-Pacific, it is important that QUAD plays a dominant role in the region to ensure freedom of navigation and keep the sea lanes of communication free of any big power coercion. In this context, the US will have to back Taiwan in a military emergency as annexation of the Island Republic will make the US, Japan and Australian military assets vulnerable to Chinese Navy expansion in the Indo-Pacific.\nWhile Japan and Australia are close military allies of the US, the Indian strategic community but not the Modi government is split over New Delhi's involvement in QUAD. The Left of Centre experts believe that India should not get caught in the war between the US and China and want New Delhi to forge ahead on strategic autonomy. This group of experts also believes that India should play a balancing role between the US and China and not let the rivalry play out in the Indian Ocean Region. The Right of Centre believes that India should join hands with the US and together meet the rapidly rising military challenge from the Xi Jinping regime or become a front-line state against Beijing in short.\nEven though Indian and Chinese armies are facing each other in East Ladakh after the May 2020 PLA transgression and the PLA Navy is operating from key ports in the Indian Ocean Region, the current government wants bilateral ties with Beijing based on mutual respect, security and sensitivity. Rather than adopt a pro-China, pro-US or even pro-Russia stance, the Modi government is forging ties with big powers based on national interest with special inclination towards democratic powers like the US.\nThe need of the hour for the Modi government is to access the latest technologies from the US and rapidly expand India's military-industrial base through domestic manufacturing under the \"Atmanirbhar Bharat\" rubric. During the bilateral meeting in Washington, Secretary Rubio indicated that the Trump administration will push the momentum on technology, defence and security ties, trade and commerce with India as domestic manufacturing is a key condition for the global high table. Until such created_at that India manufactures jet engines, fighters and submarines at home, the country will always be dependent on third powers for its defence and security needs. This month Indian Air Force Air Chief Marshal A P Singh red-flagged the HAL-DRDO for delays in meeting the first deliveries of 40 fourth-generation Tejas aircraft while China was already on the way to test the six-generation fighters. The fact is that the Indian Armed Forces and the Defence PSUs would rather buy foreign technologies off the shelf than rely on the Indian private sector through the \"Atmanirbharta\" route. The Indian civilian-military bureaucracy is equally responsible for this mess as it is focused on the process, not on results as a result of which it takes decades for a proposal to reach the decision stage. Remember, the Tejas program was conceived in 1984 and the first induction was in 2016. The Kalveri class submarine program was conceived in 1998 with the last of six submarines, INS Vaghsheer, commissioned by PM Modi on January 15. This dependency on hardware imports must go if India has to earn respect from global powers and prepare to meet rapidly rising China in the Indo-Pacific.\nWith PM Modi by far the senior leader of QUAD, the summit in India will define how democratic powers will tackle the emerging situation in the Indo-Pacific as well as build alternatives to support each other in technology, information, semiconductors and global supply chains. The Indian PM will get strong support from his close friend President Donald Trump, who revived the QUAD in his first tenure after China scuttled it in 2007.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan created_ats.

    "title": "The Humble Brag: China s Recent Wargame and Its Implications",
    "created_at": "2025-01-24",
    "text": "\nLondon: The Royal United Services Institute has issued the following press release:\nA Chinese simulation admitting to a PLAN destroyer's defeat by US missiles hints at advanced electronic warfare capabilities while raising questions about PLA transparency and messaging.\nOn 4 January 2025, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) newspaper published an article detailing how a Chinese-run ‘wargame ’ had modelled the sinking of a People ’ s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) destroyer by US missile attack. The missiles in question were the Lockheed Martin-made, US Navy/Air Force-employed AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). Given that these missiles are specifically designed to sink ships from range, the fact that they did so in a simulation is hardly remarkable. That such a simulation should be run and documented in a peer-reviewed academic publication is possibly a little more surprising, given Chinese military sensitivity. What is noteworthy is that the institute which ran the simulation is one that provides modelling and simulation tools for the PLA and is one of the institutes run by the China Electronics Technology Corporation (CETC), a powerful state-owned enterprise which has been involved with projects including China ’ s nuclear and satellite programmes. The decision of academics from the 15th Institute who presumably hold security clearances to provide interviews to a pro-Chinese government publication, a promoter of Chinese ‘soft power ’ (the SCMP) would presumably have occurred with state encouragement or at a minimum approval. This raises the question of why seemingly negative results were published in an English-language newspaper which is accessible to foreign audiences. Moreover, what can be understood regarding the People ’ s Liberation Army ’ s (PLA) assessment of its own capabilities based on the outcome of the exercise? This article seeks to provide some plausible rationales for the PLA to publicise the seemingly disappointing results of this simulation.\nThe Technical Dimensions of the Exercise: A Humble Brag?Based on what was reported regarding the exercise, the wargame simulated a large clash between the US and China. The article details a simulation set in the northeastern part of the South China Sea where the US attacks a Chinese battlegroup from the ‘nine-dash line ’ , Beijing ’ s declared limit of sovereignty in the South China Sea. The attack consists of 10 LRASM launched from different platforms, all targeting a PLAN destroyer. The simulation sees the PLA disable both radar guidance and GPS navigation by means of electronic warfare (EW). However, the ‘thermal imaging ’ capability of the LRASM (its IR seeker) allows for a terminal navigation phase for accurate and successful targeting.\nWhile the result of the simulation would appear negative for the PLAN, several details are noteworthy. First, the claim that the PLAN ’ s Type-055 cruiser was able to disable the radar on the LRASM is of interest. The reason for this is that the LRASM does not use an active radar like many anti-ship missiles, but rather relies on a passive radar for wide area surveillance using emissions from enemy ships. The advantage of passive radar is that they are a relatively difficult target for directional jamming because the location of the receiver is difficult to ascertain, unlike active radar which must emit and can thus be detected. Implicit in the Chinese claim that the LRASM ’ s passive radar was disabled, then, is the suggestion that the PLAN vessel was deemed to have located the missile with sufficient accuracy to enable directional jamming, which would involve transmitting false signals into the passive radar ’ s aperture. The jamming of the missile ’ s onboard radar would thus suggest two things. First, the vessel was deemed to have a very accurate sense of the missile ’ s location despite the LRASM ’ s stealthy profile. Second, Chinese efforts to develop modes of jamming passive radar, into which the state has invested funding through its talent programmes, are deemed to have borne fruit. The methods of doing so might include emitting signals which produce an interference peak on a radar ’ s doppler map and thus create false tracks. The PLA ’ s claimed success here would, if true, have ramifications both for the survivability of missiles with a low radar cross-section (which the PLA is implicitly claiming the ability to track) and for US naval efforts at emissions control and the use of passive detection in the first island chain.\nThe second aspect of note is that the article claims that the LRASM ’ s GPS guidance was disabled 10 km from the Type-055. While the jamming of GPS-guided capabilities is not new and has been achieved by the Russians in Ukraine against JDAM, blocking signals from all of the GNSS satellites from which a missile or munition can receive signals requires jamming over a wide area, possibly requiring multiple overlapping EW systems in the case of the Russians in Ukraine. Additionally, since US munitions are programmed to not receive messages that are not in encrypted M-Code, successful jamming would imply the ability either to spoof signals in M-Code or to generate enough power that all signals are blocked. All of this would point to a robust Electronic Counter Measures suite on the Type-055 and any vessels supporting it in the simulation.\nThe PLA ’ s claimed success would have ramifications both for the survivability of missiles with a low radar cross-section and for US naval efforts at emissions control and the use of passive detection in the first island chain\nThird, the paper talks only of the EW defences, and does not appear to consider the host of other ‘hard kill ’ , medium- and short-range options open to the PLA and PLAN. Additionally, the article references the fact that the radar coverage AWACS and fighter aircraft were not considered. As can be seen from the indignant response to the article on some Chinese message boards, many commentators have noted this omission. This could include the 1130 or 730 Close-in Weapon Systems (similar to NATO ’ s Goalkeeper or Phalanx) and ‘Hong Qi ’ (red flag) family of vertical launch systems, short- and medium-range models such as the HHQ 9 and HHQ 16. Given that the LRASM is a stealth missile, the degree to which these Chinese systems would be effective remains unexamined in the article.\nHowever, as mentioned, the claim that the Chinese battlegroup had a good enough understanding of the missile ’ s location to enable jamming of passive radar is telling. A degree of knowledge sufficient to enable directional jamming of a passive receiver would also be sufficient to enable hard kill. An implicit message might, then, be that the Type-055 could have engaged the LRASM with its onboard missiles in their terminal phase, and perhaps at even greater distances with AWACS and fighter support.\nA PLA Active Measure to Undermine LRASM?Relatedly, the claimed fidelity of the simulation is noteworthy. What is specifically alluded to is the flight profile of the missile and the assertion of a degree of ‘complex details ’ captured in the simulation by the academic paper ’ s author. This may be further indication to its adversaries that the PLA knows more than perhaps the US would like them to about the missile specifications. As defence industry experts know, details of the flight profiles, link communications, navigation systems, ranges and missile speeds are generally classified, and this is certainly true for the LRASM as a state-of-the-art ‘stealth ’ missile. That there are vertical launch variants for ships and that the LRASM has been adapted for multiple aircraft types is in the public domain, but specific details are not easy to come by. Officially released data or other promotional detail is deliberately vague, and official publications state that specifics have not been released for security reasons. It is, however, true that much can be gleaned from open source investigations, and it is not unheard of for classified details to appear on public forums; especially if the unwary are being specifically probed for such information. A classic example of such a disclosure was the well-publicised case of Challenger II tank specifications being released on a ‘War Thunder ’ gaming forum in order to try to win an argument. It is possible that the simulation was modelled around best guesses and supposition, or that technical specifications were (as claimed) garnered from prolonged and diligent open-source research.\nHowever, as discussed, it is of note that the simulation was run by the North China Institute of Computing Technology (NCICT), the 15th Research Institute of CETC. As a Chinese state-owned conglomerate, it has been implicated on multiple occasions in cases of ‘export violations ’ with certain US-based technology companies. The role of the 15th Institute and its parent organisation in the Chinese defence ecosystem would suggest that its researchers have access to classified data. Through its claims to be able to accurately model the LRASM ’ s flight profile and radar cross-section, the PLA would appear to be tacitly claiming to have either penetrated classified US systems or deduced highly classified data using available information.\nSubscribe to the Military Sciences NewsletterStay up to date with the latest publications and events from the Military Sciences Research Group\nSign upThis does, however, raise questions regarding the veracity of the claims. If the PLA was truly confident in its success in accessing sensitive data, it would have strong incentives to keep this private to achieve surprise in a conflict rather than alerting the US to the compromise of critical systems. Perhaps the PLA deems the programmatic disruption to LRASM resulting from any inquest within the US that this revelation causes to be a worthwhile result, especially if the programme is too late in its development for vulnerabilities to be easily fixed. However, if disruption is the aim, it should be noted that a similar effect could be achieved through false claims as well. As a historical analogy, we might consider how the USSR attempted to strengthen the hands of critics of the Strategic Defence Initiative by leaking (often spurious) technical data that reinforced the idea that any missile shield could be easily penetrated. One interpretation, then, is that the PLA is trying to undermine a programme which causes it genuine concern.\nThe PLA Focus on Realistic Blue ForcesMore broadly, the simulation likely tells us something about the modelling and simulation work conducted in support of the PLA, both in terms of the intelligence which supports it and the levels of realism being sought.\nThe nature of the simulation and in particular the absence of AWACS support and hard kill measures is of interest. This is, perhaps, explicable given the institute which conducted the modelling. The Beijing-based NCICT specialises in military model development and the development of major projects in aerospace measurement and control systems. The parent corporation of CETC also advertises itself as working in radar and EW-related technology. It is therefore unsurprising that the wargame appears to have limited itself to testing EW defensive measures. Industry wargaming, unlike defence ministry or military wargaming, works with different constraints and may have different or more focused aims. These can range from product design, development and testing to demonstrations and sales. It is perhaps in this light that the article should be viewed – as a declaration of capability in EW and a statement of competence to the West (and especially the US), but perhaps also an internal pitch that the NCICT has done its bit, and that it is for others to within the PLA and industry to move in by, for example, providing countermeasures against IR seekers (on which the LRASMs relied after their radar malfunctioned).\nMore broadly, the PLA is increasingly not a stranger to wargaming, and invests heavily in this and ‘opposing force training ’ , with ‘blue ’ (or enemy) forces occasionally even going so far as to wear the uniforms of the forces they are representing. The emphasis on using models with high levels of fidelity and dedicated experts on adversary forces is considered by the PLA to be critical to meeting Xi Jinping ’ s demand for realistic training and ensuring the combat effectiveness of a force that has not seen combat since 1979. The danger of what the PLA calls the ‘peace disease ’ is one that China ’ s leaders are acutely aware of.\nThe PLA is increasingly not a stranger to wargaming, and invests heavily in this and ‘opposing force training ’ , with ‘blue ’ forces occasionally even going so far as to wear the uniforms of the forces they are representing\nSince Chinese leaders and planners seem aware that the PLA ’ s lack of combat experience is both a limitation and something which likely opponents may perceive as a weakness, advertising the fact that Chinese wargames are not just scripted exercises in which the PLA always wins might, then, be seen as a way of making the PLA more credible in the eyes of its opponents. The message may be that unlike, for example, the Russian military before Ukraine – which was plagued by the habit of subordinates painting excessively rosy pictures to their superiors – the PLA is a force which confronts its own deficiencies.\nMoreover, the accompanying risk that the negative outcome leads an opponent to downrate its assessment of Chinese equipment is mitigated. Any potential adversary – in this case the US – will know that the limitations of the simulation as discussed in the SCMP article will be well understood by the PLA, and the findings of a military run wargame are unlikely to be so well publicised. In addition to the hard kill options and AWACS support mentioned above, the wider principles of anti-access/area denial would be at play, making any scenario as proposed in the simulation far more complex, multi-layered and multi-dimensional.\nConclusionIn conclusion, the Chinese article was an interestingly stark acknowledgment that the US is the enemy, rather than using a nameless adversary with capabilities similar to the US that often features in exercise and wargames. Although framed as a ‘humble brag ’ with the loss of a PLAN destroyer, the article clearly advertised a certain Chinese confidence in the inevitable arms race in which China and the US, as technological world leaders, are engaged. The (possible) NCICT sales pitch hints at a certain level of knowledge and understanding, and leaves much unsaid for the US to consider as it continues in the development of increasingly complex, stealthy and long-range anti-ship missiles. It is therefore an article of interest to many ‘defence watchers ’ , but manages to deliver some very specific messages.\n"

    "text": "\nLink to Image\nLink to Story\nMANILA - The new Trump administration is off to a muscular start with its\"peace through strength\" strategy, a policy flex expressed in a series of key appointments and meetings that has already impressed top allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific.Barely hours into his new office, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a bilateral meeting with India's Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar to underscore the centrality of Asia in Trump's foreign policy.\nRubio also held a phone conversation with his Filipino counterpart in which he reiterated America's\"ironclad\" commitment to defend its Southeast Asian mutual defense treaty ally in the event of armed conflict with China in the South China Sea.\nMeanwhile, Philippine Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro Jr personally met new US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz to reaffirm the\"enduring alliance between the Philippines and the United States.\"\nJust days into office, the new Trump administration also convened the latest iteration of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, better known as the\"Quad\", which brought together top diplomats from Australia, Japan, India and the US.\nIn a joint statement, Rubio and his Quad counterparts underscored their\"shared commitment to strengthening a Free and Open Indo-Pacific where the rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty, and territorial integrity are upheld and defended.\"\nIn a thinly veiled criticism of revisionist powers, most notably China, the Quad ministers made it clear that they\"strongly oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion.\"\nMeanwhile, newly inaugurated President Trump signaled a more pragmatic approach in his second term by firing and lambasting Iran hawks while elevating pragmatists such as Michael DiMino as the Pentagon's new top Middle East official.\nCoupled with Trump's call for ending the \"ridiculous war\" in Ukraine and growing pressure on European allies to shoulder their own defense burdens, recent key appointments will strengthen the voice of so-called\"prioritizers\" led by Elbridge Colby, a nominee for under-secretary of defense for policy who has emphasized the need for a more China-focused US foreign policy.\nBy reorienting America's strategic focus from old theaters in Europe and the Middle East, the second Trump administration is seemingly set to double down on its defense alliance and deterrence strategy in the Indo-Pacific.\nLatest stories Move over CHIPS Act, Stargate is the future Bank of Japan hikes rates with a wary eye on Trump From innovation to production of new US defense systemsIn his inauguration address, Trump set the tone for his foreign policy by emphasizing his commitment to end wars around the world.\"My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be - a peacemaker and a unifier,\" he declared, directly taking credit for the newly implemented ceasefire in Gaza, which was largely negotiated by Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\"Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into,\" he added, echoing his administration's\"peace through strength\" mantra.\nTrump has signaled a more pragmatic approach to adversaries, most notably Iran. Just hours into his second term, he fired his former Iran envoy, Brian Hook, a proponent of a\"maximum pressure\" campaign against the Middle Eastern power who oversaw the recent transition at the Department of State.\nMeanwhile, Trump also publicly attacked his former national security adviser, John Bolton, as a\"warmonger\" who oversaw disastrous interventions in the Middle East. Both Bolton and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who had advocated for confrontation with Iran, were also stripped off their security profiles.\nTrump's Middle East policy will thus be driven by more pragmatic voices. Following his successful negotiation of the Gaza ceasefire, Witkoff has been appointed as Trump's new Iran envoy.\n\"He's certainly someone I would use. He's done a fantastic job . . . Steve has a wonderful way about him,\" Trump said about his new Iran envoy and prospects for a new nuclear deal with Iran.\"It would really be nice if that could be worked out without having to go that further step [of military confrontation]...Iran, hopefully, will make a deal.\"\nWitkoff's regional diplomacy will be complemented by the Pentagon's new Middle East top official Michael DiMino , who is known for his more critical stance on Israel and advocacy for a more\"offshore balancing\" strategy in the Middle East.\n\"There are no vital or existential U.S. interests in the [Middle East] region,\" DiMino argued last year in a webinar, underscoring the need for a major reorientation in American foreign policy.\"We're really there to counter Iran, and that's really at the behest of the Israelis and the Saudis,\" he added, advocating instead for a more limited American military presence in an increasingly multipolar region.\nThat viewpoint tracks with the Pentagon's incoming top policy official, Elbridge Colby, an influential strategic thinker who oversaw the formulation of the first Trump administration's National Security Strategy.\n\"We need to prioritize the potential for a conflict with China precisely in order to avoid it,\" Colby argued in a major conference last October.\"I think it's empirically true that China is preparing for war, and we do have the possibility of a multi-front war and the possibility of a World War III in the coming years, and we're not prepared.\"\nSimilar to DiMino, Colby has also drawn on his own bitter experience in dealing with the Middle East, especially when he served as part of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq in 2003 as well as on the 2004-2005 President's Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission under the George W Bush administration.\nWhile adopting more traditionally hawkish views on Iran, Trump's other top cabinet officials have also expressed openness to a less confrontational policy in the Middle East in favor of focusing on the broader Indo-Pacific region, particularly China.\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Rubio made it clear that he would support\"any arrangement that allows us to have safety and stability in the region but one in which we're clear-eyed\" about threats posed by adversaries such as Iran. The more pragmatic tone on Iran, coupled with a concerted push to end the conflict in Ukraine, underscores China's centrality to the second Trump administration's grand strategy.\nSign up for one of our free newsletters\nThe Daily ReportStart your day right with Asia created_ats' top storiesAT Weekly ReportA weekly roundup of Asia created_ats' most-read stories\nRubio has characterized China as\"the most potent, dangerous and near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted\", thus the urgency of doubling down the Quad and existing military alliances in the Indo-Pacific. Though also known as an Iran hawk, National Security Adviser Waltz has also emphasized the need for America to\"quickly wind up the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East to free up military assets to confront and deter China.\"\nTrump's defense secretary nominee, Pete Hagseth, who, similar to Waltz, also served in America's wars in the Middle East, has argued along similar lines and has criticized the outgoing Biden administration for not sufficiently decoupling from conflicts in the Middle East in favor of a China-centered strategy.\nBy and large, America's top Asian allies seem optimistic about the second Trump administration's signaled direction. Ahead of her meeting with Rubio, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong characterized bilateral ties with Washington as\"our most important strategic relationship.\"\n\"It's a demonstration of the collective commitment of all countries to the Quad, an ironclad commitment in this created_at where close cooperation in the Indo-Pacific is so important,\" she told reporters on the eve of the first Quad meeting just hours into the new administration.\nJapan's top diplomat was even more effusive about the new administration's nuanced approach to foreign policy and sound pragmatism.\n\"I was very impressed that [Rubio's] explanation of the Quad didn't mention China by name and antagonize it. I had thought of him as a hard-liner against China, but as we talked, I found he was a well-balanced individual,\" Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said after the Quad meeting this week.\nFollow Richard Javad Heydarian on X at @RichHeydarian\nSign up here to comment on Asia created_ats storiesOrSign in to an existing accounThank you for registering!\nAn account was already registered with this email.

    "text": "\nPeople's Daily: The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2025 is being held in Davos, Switzerland. The WEF is an important platform for discussions of global economic issues. Could you share with us China's propositions?\nMao Ning: Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Ding Xuexiang delivered a special address at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting. He shared four observations: first, jointly promote a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization; second, jointly uphold and practice true multilateralism; third, jointly foster new drivers and strengths for global economic development; fourth, jointly tackle major global challenges such as climate change, food security and energy security.\nVice Premier Ding Xuexiang stressed that economic globalization is an inherent requirement for the development of productive forces, and an inevitable result of technological advancement. It is not a you-lose-I-win zero-sum game, but a universally beneficial process where all can benefit and win together. Protectionism leads nowhere. Trade war has no winners. It's important to tackle the development challenges with universal benefit, and pool strengths with inclusive cooperation, so as to usher in a new phase of economic globalization that is more dynamic, more inclusive and more sustainable. We need to find a win-win and all-win solution, one that is based on mutually beneficial cooperation, and not only make the pie of economic globalization bigger, but also distribute it better.\nVice Premier Ding Xuexiang gave an overview of China's economy. He shared three major trends that characterize the Chinese economy: first, high-quality development is making solid progress; second, green and low-carbon transition is accelerating across the board; third, reform and opening up is moving up to a higher level. China will further intensify macro policies, continue high-quality development, effectively pursue higher-quality economic growth and appropriately increase economic output, and inject strong and sustained impetus to global economic development.\nChina News Service: In a press release on January 17, the US Department of Treasury announced sanctions against relevant Chinese company and citizen that were involved with Salt Typhoon's cyberattack. What's China's response?\nMao Ning: China opposes the accusations made by the Biden administration without any convincing evidence and their abuse of sanctions against China. In fact, the US has conducted large-scale and systemic cyberattacks on China for years. We have made very clear our concerns and opposition on this for many created_ats.\nWhen it comes to cyber issues, China and the US are countries with big influence. The two sides share similar concerns on safeguarding cybersecurity, especially the security of key infrastructure. It's important for the two countries to follow the principle of equality and mutual respect, frankly discuss issues of respective concerns on the basis of fact and evidence, observe the same international rules, and jointly keep the cyberspace peaceful and stable. The US needs to stop abusing sanctions.\nTASS: On Tuesday, President Donald Trump will levy tariff on Chinese exports to the US, with an expected start date of February 1. What is China's comment?\nMao Ning: We have made clear China's position on this issue multiple created_ats. We believe that there's no winner in a trade or tariff war, and we firmly uphold our national interests.\nGlobal created_ats: The Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation said they arrested a Chinese national and two Filipinos suspected of conducting espionage operations. Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief Romero Brawner Jr. said the Chinese spy was found near the US military bases in the Philippines, and Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said they would ensure an airtight case against the Chinese spy to uphold the Philippines' sovereignty and security. What's China's response?\nMao Ning: The Chinese government, as always, asks Chinese nationals overseas to abide by local laws and regulations. We hope the Philippines will stick to the fact, stop shadow-chasing, stop peddling the so-called Chinese spy, and earnestly protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese nationals in the Philippines.\nKyodo News: It was reported that foreign ministers of Japan and the US, as well as foreign ministers of Quad, met in Washington on January 21 to exchange views on issues including China's attempt to change the status quo in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. What is your comment on this?\nMao Ning: China believes that cooperation between countries should not target any third party. Engaging in group politics and bloc confrontation will not bring lasting peace and security, and is not conducive to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and the world as a whole. China's activities in relevant waters are lawful, legitimate and completely justified. We hope that relevant parties will do more things that help enhance mutual trust and cooperation between countries.\nThe New York created_ats: Has China changed the Chinese name that it uses for Secretary of State Rubio? If so, does that have a bearing on whether or not he's covered by China's sanctions?\nMao Ning: I am not yet aware of what you mentioned. If you ask me, instead of how his name is translated in Chinese, it's his actual name in English that is more important. On the sanctions, I want to say that my colleague made clear China's position yesterday. What I can tell you is that China's sanctions are aimed at the words and actions that harm China's legitimate rights and interests.\nAFP: The Thailand government today denied that it was planning to send 48 Uyghurs held in the country's detention centers back to China. These 48 people had fled China and were arrested in Thailand over a decade ago. Can the Foreign Ministry tell us if there are any plans with Thailand to receive these Uyghurs or give us any update?\nMao Ning: I'm not familiar with what you mentioned. More broadly, China's position on the issue of illegal immigration is consistent and clear. We resolutely fight activities of illegal immigration in any form and oppose any act of condoning or even supporting illegal immigration. China is a country under the rule of law and will properly handle relevant issue by strengthening international law enforcement and security cooperation.\nDragon TV: It's reported that on January 21, a fire at a hotel in T\\xFCrkiye killed 76 people and injured 51. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a day of national mourning to be observed on January 22. What's China's comment?\nMao Ning: We share the grief over the fatal fire accident that took place in T\\xFCrkiye's Bolu province yesterday. Our hearts go out to the victims and those who have lost their loved ones, and we wish those who were injured speedy recovery.\nAFP: There are some reports on social media of a Chinese national having been killed in an attack in north Afghanistan. These reports say that a Chinese worker in the mining industry was killed last night in Takhar province. Can the Foreign Ministry confirm or give us any details on this attack and this Chinese national?\nMao Ning: I'm not yet familiar with what you mentioned. I believe our Embassy in Afghanistan will track the information over what's happened, and do its utmost to protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese citizens and their safety.\nBloomberg: On TikTok. US President Donald Trump has said he would be open to Elon Musk or Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison purchasing social media app TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government. Does the Foreign Ministry have any comment on this? And how would China feel about the US government being part of a joint venture that splits the ownership of TikTok?\nMao Ning: On TikTok, my colleagues and I have repeatedly stated China's principled position over the past few days, and you may refer to that.\nReuters: Could you tell us more on how the strategic communication channel on major topics between China and the US works? Who from the China side is speaking to the US on this channel and from which arm of the Chinese government? And likewise, who is on the US end of this channel?\nMao Ning: We have no information to share at this created_at.\nAFP: With the threat of 10 percent tariffs, are there any talks happening already or any negotiations going on?\nMao Ning: What I can say is that we stand ready to maintain communication with the US, properly handle differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation and pursue a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-US relationship. China will also firmly defend its own interests.\nRT TV: Trump, shortly after being sworn in, threatens 100 percent tariffs on BRICS nations if they continue de-dollarization efforts. Do you have any response to this?\nMao Ning: As an important platform for cooperation among emerging markets and developing countries, BRICS advocates openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation, not bloc confrontation, and does not target any third party. The aim is to realize common development and prosperity. China stands ready to continue working with BRICS partners to deepen practical cooperation in various fields and make more contribution to the sustained and steady growth of the world economy.\nReuters: I just wanna follow up on the Thailand-Uyghur issue. The UN human rights experts released a statement yesterday urging Thailand to immediately stop the possible transfer of the 48 Uhghurs to China. In the statement, the UN warned, to quote the statement, that the group was at real risk of torture or other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment if they are returned. How does China respond to this statement?\nMao Ning: Judging by your question, this is a matter regarding the judicial cooperation between two sovereign states. UN experts, whatever their role is, should fulfill their mandate in a just and objective manner in line with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council, and make sure that nothing they say or do interferes in the judicial sovereignty of UN member states and their normal judicial cooperation, instead of speaking out irresponsibly on those matters.\nBloomberg: Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Tuesday with his Quad counterparts from Australia, India and Japan. I'm just wondering if the Foreign Ministry has any comments on the meeting.\nMao Ning: This question was raised by Kyoto News. I already gave an answer.\nNBC: I just want to know if you have a latest comment on the Panama Canal issue. President Trump warned of the danger of China taking control of the canal, and he would like to take it back from Panama. Do you have any comment on this?\nMao Ning: We agree with Panama's President Jos\\xE9 Ra\\xFAl Mulino that Panama's sovereignty and independence are not negotiable, and the Panama Canal is not under direct or indirect control by any power. China does not take part in managing or operating the Canal. Never ever has China interfered. We respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize it as a permanently neutral international waterway.\nSource: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China\n"

    "title": "Ideology still an issue in round two with Trump",
    "created_at": "2025-01-24",
    "text": "\nFrom race to gender to religion, the second administration of US President Donald Trump is certain to reverse the ideological direction on a wide range of issues set by his predecessor, Joe Biden. But there is one thing the two teams share - a deepening disregard for China's political ideology. \nTrump is not known to have strong ideological positions, but observers say his team is expected to use ideology as a tool in its strategies with China - priorities could lead to new sources of friction with Beijing. \nWhile Biden's cabinet focused attention on the LGBTQ community, women's rights and the political values it shared with allies, Trump's administration is expected to use a more unilateral approach to refocus on religious freedoms in China and the legitimacy of the country's ruling Communist Party, they say. \nFei-Ling Wang, a professor at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said he expected the ideological conflict between the United States and China to persist, but also to shift. \n\"Compared to the Biden administration and Trump's first administration, we may see more inflammatory rhetoric and highly symbolic gestures, but less talk about human rights in places such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong,\" he said.  \n\"The new Trump administration may be more focused on policies targeting the Communist Party's power and legitimacy at home and abroad, in a Cold War-like, anti-communism fashion.\" \nAs he reflected on his presidency in his farewell address on January 15, Biden said the United States had \"pulled ahead in our competition with China\", and that \"as the land of liberty, America - not China - must lead the world\" in the development of artificial intelligence. \nThe assessment echoed the rhetoric of the previous four years in which the Democratic Party repeatedly framed the competition with China as \"democracy versus authoritarianism\", and used its \"small yard, high fence\" policy to contain its hi-tech development. \nDuring that term, the administration held three \"democracy summits\", all of which excluded China. For Beijing, the message was clear support for regime change. After the 2021 summit, Beijing said the US had a history of imposing its political values and instigating \"colour revolutions\".  \nBut Trump is not driven by ideology, according to Yun Sun, a senior fellow and co-director of the East Asia Programme and director of the China Programme at the Stimson Centre, a think tank in Washington.  \n\"His team might be. But for him, ideology is an instrument rather than the policy goal. He might allow his team to use ideology to press China, but he personally does not have that aspiration,\" Yun said. \nInstead, Trump's main focus would be on economic benefits, said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \n\"However, if the economic dealings don't go smoothly and relations with China worsen, he might allow national security and ideological hawks to take the lead in shaping his China policy,\" said Wu, who is also director at the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University. \nA precedent was set in Trump's first term. As US-China relations worsened during the Covid-19 pandemic, Trump's officials repeatedly targeted the Communist Party in official statements, a move seen by Beijing as advocating \"regime change\". \nAccording to analysts, the hawkish senior officials in Trump's second administration are likely to recycle these critical narratives of Beijing in service of Trump's strategic goals. \n\"Trump wants to create pain for Beijing as a negotiating tactic to achieve a better deal for the American economy,\" said Neil Thomas, a fellow for politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Centre for China Analysis.  \n\"But [Secretary of State] Marco Rubio's anti-communist credentials mean the day-to-day diplomacy of the State Department towards China could become more adversarial and less attentive to consultation and dialogue.\" \nSuch views could be heard loud and clear during the confirmation hearings for Trump's cabinet picks. \nRubio, a long-created_at China hawk, has consistently opposed Beijing's policies and co- sponsored several acts targeting alleged human rights abuses, earning him a spot on China's sanctions list since 2020. \nDuring his confirmation hearing last week, Rubio sharply criticised Beijing's global ambitions, accused it of violating Hong Kong's autonomy and laid out his concerns about \"aggressive\" naval activities in the South China Sea as well as the human rights record in Xinjiang. He said there was a need to reduce US dependence on mainland China and support Taiwan's participation in international organisations. \nIn a similar vein, John Ratcliffe, Trump's nominee for CIA director, pledged in his hearing on January 14 to intensify the agency's focus on China and cybersecurity threats, calling Beijing a \"key threat\" and a \"once-in-a-generation challenge\".  \nThe same day, Pete Hegseth, nominated for secretary of defence, informed the US Congress that he would make certain the Pentagon prioritised the Communist Party as \"front and centre\" among foreign threats to the US. \nIn Rubio's case, he was \"obligated to serve Trump's strategic goals\", which could mean compromising \"his principles and [becoming] a pawn for Trump to maximise Trump's interests while competing with China\", according to Jinghao Zhou, an associate professor of Asian studies at Hobart and William Smith Colleges. \nPeter T.C. Chang, a visiting senior fellow with the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the dynamic between Trump and his hawkish subordinates could lead to \"an administration marked by conflicting stances\".  \nFor decades, Beijing has been wary of Washington as a catalyst for protests and potential \"regime change\" in developing nations.  \nThe deep-seated suspicions have driven decision makers in China to strictly contain the spread of Western political ideas such as \"woke\" culture and the #MeToo movement, believing they have been used as channels to infiltrate and subvert Chinese society.  \nThe authorities have cracked down on human rights lawyers, labour activists, feminists and LGBTQ groups for alleged connections with foreign forces. \nRemarks by Biden officials may have heightened Beijing's fears. When Chinese internet regulators shut down more than a dozen LGBTQ WeChat accounts in 2021, the move immediately drew criticism from the US State Department, which argued that the groups had been \"exercising their right to freedom of expression and freedom of speech\". \nTwo years later, the Biden administration unnerved Chinese nationalists when then Treasury secretary Janet Yellen hosted a lunch with women economists during her visit to Beijing.  \nThe diverse cabinet showcase and display of empowered women did not go over well with many in China, who labelled the attendees \"radical feminists\" and \"traitors\". \nThomas from the Asia Society said Trump was not expected to take the same tack. \"Trump sees human rights as a much lower priority for US foreign policy than many of his cabinet nominees, a situation that is likely to create policy tensions and personal frustrations within the new administration,\" he said. \nChina observer Andrew Nathan, a Columbia University professor of political science, agreed, saying he did not think labour rights, freedom of speech or political repression \"will figure in Trump's China policy\". \nWang, from Georgia Tech, suggested the new administration would continue to target rights issues - but not the same ones as the Biden White House. \"While the Trump administration may tune down criticisms against Beijing on issues related to human rights for LGBTQ, women and ethnic minorities, it is expected to continue, even enhance, US criticisms of China on the rights and freedom of religious groups such as 'underground' churches, and religious sects such as the Falun Gong,\" Wang said. \nNathan added that for US foreign policy, upholding religious freedom also meant \"opposition to the attacks on Tibetan Buddhism and on Muslim communities in China\". \nChina officially recognises five religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Protestantism and Catholicism.  \nFalun Gong has been deemed a cult by Beijing.  \nAccording to the 2020 World Religion Database, around 7.4 per cent of Chinese identify as Christians. \nUnder President Xi Jinping, the country has intensified its control over religions, particularly Islam and Christianity, through the \"Sinicisation of religion\" policy, which aims to strengthen national security and curb foreign influence.  \nWu, from Fudan University, said \"religious right-wing figures\" within the Republican Party would bring up the religious freedom issue, creating ideological tension points, but they were not likely to hold democracy summits like the Biden administration.  \nIn Trump's first term, many of his senior officials, including then vice-president Mike Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo, went on at length about what they said was Chinese religious oppression, especially in the far-western region of Xinjiang, ultimately imposing sanctions on individual Chinese officials. These included then Politburo member and Xinjiang party chief Chen Quanguo - the most senior Chinese official ever to land on a US sanctions list. \nBeijing hit back with its own sanctions against a wide range of US politicians, including multiple members of the Senate and the House of Representatives. But Sam Brownback, ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom in Trump's first term, who repeatedly accused the Chinese government of being \"at war with faith\", was the only Trump administration official to be sanctioned. \nBrownback was also vocal on Tibet and in 2019 asked the United Nations to take up the succession issue of the 14th Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's exiled spiritual leader, to stop China from trying to hand-pick his successor. \nTrump's new administration and Beijing are likely to differ sharply in terms of governance philosophies as well as international collaborations - a gulf that could shape the ideological landscape between the two superpowers in a way that creates two spheres of influence, according to analysts. \nSuch a shift has been reflected in the approach of Argentina's two most recent presidents. \nAlberto Fernandez, who was president from 2019 to 2023, was a left-leaning leader who engaged deeply with the Global South and even paid tribute at the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall during his visit to China in 2022.  \nThe current president, Javier Milei, has embraced crypto­currency, deregulation and a free-market approach that has resonated with Trump's own pro-market sencreated_atnts. \nGeorgia Tech's Wang said Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk \"certainly will strengthen the right-turn trend of privatisation and decentralisation worldwide\". \nMilei attended Trump's inauguration on Monday - a break from the tradition of foreign heads of state not attending such events. \nThe invitation to attend was \"a symbolic gesture of Trump's personality-driven diplomacy, aimed at promoting his domestic agenda in support of deregulation and free-market policies among his base\", Zhou said. \"This could potentially challenge China's state-controlled model and reshape international alliances.\" \nStill, Zhou said, Trump's main focus remained on protecting US interests in competition with China, against the backdrop of an age-old rivalry between command and market economies, a dynamic that could lead to \"hybrid approaches\" in some countries. \nWu argued that the United States' \"small government\" and China's state-controlled models should be interpreted as a reflection of different values, instead of \"confrontational ideologies\".  \nWhile both countries could decide what was in its own best interests, the decisions would not directly influence bilateral relations, he said. \nBut Wu, at Fudan, said the Trump administration's values concerning global governance - and especially Washington's promotion of deglobalisation, unilateralism and \"America first\" - were contradictory to Beijing's public positions on global governance, multilateralism and international cooperation. \nAnother area of potential ideological conflict lies within environmental policies. The US might lose its global leadership in the arena due to Trump's dismissal of the climate change consensus. And a Trump withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement could create a vacuum in which China assumed a larger role in the global battle against climate change, observers said.\n"

    "text": "\nPresident Donald Trump is in the fifth day of his second term in office, striving to remake the traditional boundaries of Washington by asserting unprecedented executive power.\nThe president also took his first trip of his second administration on Friday, touring areas where politics has clouded the response to deadly disasters. He first traveled to hurricane-battered western North Carolina, where he described FEMA as “a very big disappointment.” Later Friday, Trump arrived in wildfire-ravaged Los Angeles, and he greeted political rival California Gov. Gavin Newsom with a handshake.\nHere's the latest:\nA look at false and misleading claims made by Trump during his first week\nTrump has wasted no created_at setting a new agenda, relying on false and misleading information to support several of his initiatives.\nHe told attendees at the World Economic in Davos he had a massive mandate from the American people because he had millions of votes. While the electoral vote was 312 for Trump and 226 for former Vice President Kamala Harris, he won the popular vote by only about 2.3 million votes, 49.9% to 48.4%.\nPardoning Jan. 6 rioters, he falsely claimed there were only a few minor incidents with police.\nHe has also continued to greatly inflate the number of people who entered the country illegally during President Joe Biden’s administration, and has misrepresented water issues in California while discussing recent wildfires.\n▶ Read more about false or misleading claims made by Trump this week\nNewsom and Trump exchange kind words before touring Los Angeles wildfire damage\nNewsom says California will need the federal government’s help and support.\n“I have all the expectations we’re going to be able to work together,” Newsom said.\nTrump responded: “We’re going to get it fixed.”\nIt might seem like odd messaging for the two rivals. But it’s similar to the approach Newsom took toward Trump during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic\nNewsom and Trump greet each other with a handshake\nTrump says he appreciates the California governor greeting him on the tarmac in Los Angeles.\nIt’s not clear if the Democratic governor will join Trump to tour a fire-ravaged neighborhood or for a fire-related briefing. He’s not listed as a participant in those events.\nNewsom’s office says the governor is “committed to advocating for the needs of Californians in partnership with the federal administration.”\nNewsom has a fine political tightrope to walk. He’s pushed back against some of Trump’s criticism of the state’s handling of the wildfires but also needs the federal government to approve wildfire assistance.\nOne Pacific Palisades resident who lost homes in LA fires says he is unfazed by Trump’s threat to withhold federal aid\nRon Flury, who has lived in the Pacific Palisades for 25 years, said he was glad Trump was in office because “at least something will happen now.”\nFlury was driving through the neighborhood Friday and surveying the remnants of the four homes he lost, two of which were occupied by him and his daughter. His only surviving property is a partially built home that recently resumed construction.\n“I’m hoping he will help us build back, and I think it will be better than ever but will take awhile,” Flury said.\nHe’s unfazed by Trump’s threat to withhold federal aid unless California changes its water policy — in fact, he supports it.\n“Someone needs to force (Newsom) to actually follow through and do the things he should be doing,” Flury said. “And that’s what Trump is doing, it’s a negotiation point.”\nSupreme Court will weigh approval for US’ 1st publicly funded religious charter school, in Oklahoma\nThe Supreme Court agreed Friday to take on a new culture war dispute: whether the nation’s first publicly funded religious charter school should be allowed to open in Oklahoma.\nThe justices said they would review an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision that invalidated a state board’s approval of an application by the Catholic Church in Oklahoma to open a charter school.\nThe conservative-dominated high court has issued several decisions in recent years signaling a willingness to allow public funds to flow to religious entities. At the same created_at, conservative-led states have sought to insert religion into public schools, including Louisiana’s requirement that the Ten Commandments be posted in classrooms.\nRubio tells Chinese FM the US will put America first in relations with China\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio has told China’s foreign minister that the Trump administration will put U.S. interests and the American people first in its relationship and competition with China.\nIt was the first phone call Rubio has had with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi since Rubio took office.\nIn the call, Rubio also expressed “serious concern over China’s coercive actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea.”\nEarlier Friday, the Chinese foreign ministry had issued its own description of the call, saying that Wang had told Rubio the two sides should push for the steady, healthy and sustainable development of the China-U.S. relations and find the correct way for the two countries to cope with each other.\nRubio, according to the Chinese foreign ministry, told Wang the U.S. doesn’t support Taiwan independence but hopes the issue can be peacefully solved in a way acceptable to both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. statement made no mention of Rubio saying that.\nIndiana man arrested on charges he threatened Trump on TikTok\nAn Indiana man accused of using TikTok to urge attacks on the government and death to Trump has been arrested.\nThe FBI said 23-year-old Douglas Thrams of Goshen made a series of threats in videos posted to the social media site this week.\nIn one TikTok video, Thrams said Trump needed to be killed “and this created_at don’t ... miss,” an FBI agent wrote in a court filing.\nHe is charged with using interstate commerce to make threats.\nThrams is in custody awaiting an appearance Monday in federal court in South Bend.

But despite the solid job market and low 4.1% unemployment rate, he has to contend with headwinds like inflation, a budget deficit, increased tensions over trade, the fallout from his plans to curtail immigration and a persistent wealth gap.\nEach of these issues could help to shape how voters feel about a president they returned to the White House with the specific goal of fixing the economy.\n▶Read more about the economic headwinds\nSenate confirmation vote for Hegseth set for Friday night\nThe Senate is muscling Pete Hegseth’s nomination as defense secretary toward confirmation.\nThe Republican senators are prioritizing the former Fox News host and combat veteran’s vow to create a “warrior culture” at the Pentagon over allegations of heavy drinking and aggressive behavior toward women.\nVotes are expected by Friday evening.\n▶Read more about the Hegseth vote\nJustice Department curtails prosecutions for blocking reproductive health care facilities\nPresident Donald Trump’s new Justice Department leadership is curtailing prosecutions against people accused of blocking reproductive health care facilities, calling the cases an example of the “weaponization” of law enforcement.\nJustice Department chief of staff Chad Mizelle said in a memo obtained Friday by The Associated Press that prosecutions and civil actions under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act or “FACE Act” will now be permitted only in “extraordinary circumstances” or in cases presenting ”significant aggravating factors.”\nMizelle also ordered the immediate dismissal of three FACE Act cases related to 2021 blockades of clinics in Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Ohio. One man was accused of obtaining “illegal access to a secure patient space at a Planned Parenthood facility in Philadelphia without staff permission or knowledge” and barricading himself in a restroom, according to court papers.\nPutin echoes Trump’s claim that conflict in Ukraine could have been avoided had he been in office\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Friday echoed U.S. President Donald Trump’s claim the conflict in Ukraine could have been prevented had he been in the White House in 2022. He also said Moscow is ready for talks with the U.S. on a broad range of issues.\nIn an interview with Russian state television, Putin praised Trump as a “clever and pragmatic man” who is focused on U.S. interests.\n“We always had a business-like, pragmatic but also trusting relationship with the current U.S. president,” Putin said. “I couldn’t disagree with him that if he had been president, if they hadn’t stolen victory from him in 2020, the crisis that emerged in Ukraine in 2022 could have been avoided.”\nPutin’s statement was his bluntest endorsement yet of Trump’s refusal to accept his defeat in the 2020 election.\nTrump also has said repeatedly he wouldn’t have allowed the conflict to start if he’d been in office, even though he was president as fighting grew in the east of the country between Kyiv’s forces and separatists aligned with Moscow, ahead of Putin sending in tens of thousands of troops in 2022.\n▶ Read more about Russia and Trump\nTrump administration has withdrawn a federal rule which would have phased out menthol cigarettes\nThe cigarettes are disproportionately used by young and minority smokers.\nThe action was widely expected by anti-smoking advocates, who’ve spent years pushing for a ban on menthol, the only flavor still allowed in cigarettes. Tobacco companies have typically faced lighter regulation under Republican administrations.\nThe Food and Drug Administration spent years studying the issue and concluded menthol’s cooling sensation makes it easier to start and harder to quit cigarettes.\nThe FDA was widely expected to finalize the regulation last year, but President Joe Biden’s White House delayed its release, kicking a potential political controversy out past the election. At the created_at, both Biden and Trump were aggressively courting Black voters in swing states.\nThe persistence of menthol has long infuriated health experts, who’ve been pushing for a ban since the FDA gained authority over tobacco products in 2009.\nVice President JD Vance celebrated Trump’s previous actions on abortion\nSpeaking at the March for Life in Washington, Vance said the president “delivered on his promise of ending Roe,” appointed hundreds of anti-abortion judges and pardoned anti-abortion activists he says were “unjustly imprisoned.”\n“Our country faces the return of the most pro-family, most pro-life American president of our lifecreated_ats,” Vance told the crowd of protesters who cheered and chanted “JD” as he took the stage.\nPresident Trump speaks to March for Life crowd in a video address\nIn the video address to March for Life crowds, Trump vowed “we will again stand proudly for families and for life” in his second term and once again boasted about nominating three Supreme Court justices who helped strike down Roe v. Wade.\n“I was so proud to be a participant,” he said. “Six courageous justices of the Supreme Court of the United States returned the issue to the state legislatures and to the people where it belongs.”\nCrowds cheered as Trump celebrated pardoning anti-abortion activists convicted of blockading abortion clinic entrances and thanked protesters for gathering at March for Life to “stand up for precious little babies who can’t stand up for themselves.”\n“Thank you for turning out once again to show your extraordinary love and compassion for the unborn,” he said.\nTarget is ending its DEI goals as workplace inclusion gets a strong opponent in the White House\nDiscount store chain Target said Friday it would join rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack from conservative activists and, as of this week, the White House.\nThe Minneapolis-based retailer said the changes to its “Belonging at the Bulleye” strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.\nTarget, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.\nThe goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.\n▶ Read more about Target ending its DEI goals\nOntario leader will call election to fight Trump’s threatened tariffs\nThe leader of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, said Friday that he would call an early election, because he says he needs a mandate to fight President Trump’s threatened tariffs.\nPremier Doug Ford of the Progressive Conservative Party said that he planned to make the announcement on Wednesday. The move would send Ontarians to the polls on Feb. 27, more than a year before the June 2026 fixed election date. Ford already has a large majority government.\nFord, who is the equivalent of a U.S. state governor, said that Ontario could lose upwards of 500,000 jobs should Trump follow through on his 25% tariff threat.\n▶ Read more about how Ontario is responding to Trump’s proposed tariffs\nDefense Department is expected to put out its own temporary social media ban Friday, U.S. officials say\nThe 10-day ban, however, carves out exceptions for military bases around the world that rely on social media posts to inform them of security incidents, school matters and normal base activities.\nOther federal agencies are doing the same thing, with guidance from the Trump administration suggesting that federal agencies shouldn’t put out information unless it’s been approved by the new leadership. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.\n— Lolita C. Baldor\n‘You can’t have a security detail for the rest of your life because you worked for government’\nPresident Donald Trump says he won’t feel partially responsible if harm befalls former government officials whose security details were cut by his administration after he took office this week.\nTrump revoked the security detail of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the infectious disease expert who advised Trump on the COVID-19 pandemic but turned critical of Trump once he tried to undermine public health guidance. He faced regular threats to his life and has received federal protection for years, but it was ended this week according to a person familiar with the matter.\n“They all made a lot of money, they can hire their own security too,” Trump told reporters in North Carolina.\nTrump earlier this week revoked protection details for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his top aide, Brian Hook, as well his own former national security adviser John Bolton, who have faced threats from Iran since they took hardline stances on the Islamic Republic during Trump’s first administration. All three have fallen out with Trump in the years since he left office.\nTheir security details had been repeatedly renewed by the Biden administration because of credible and ongoing threats from Iran.\n“You can’t have a security detail for the rest of your life because you worked for government,” Trump said.\nAsheville artist, who lost business in Hurricane Helene, wary about Trump’s visit\nSarah Wells Rolland, co-owner of The Village Potters Clay Center in Asheville’s now-destroyed River Arts District, said she’s “seriously concerned” about her city’s future recovery from Hurricane Helene under President Donald Trump’s administration. Rolland noted Asheville’s Democratic lean as a reason Trump may not prioritize its rebuilding process.\n“I’m not overly optimistic that the Trump administration is going to do anything long-term,” Rolland said Friday ahead of Trump’s visit to the area. “Frankly, I’ll tell you, I think him coming today is to look presidential.”\nRolland lost hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment when her ceramics center’s roofing caved and water rose 26 feet inside her facility during Helene. She’s operated a temporary clay supply site for the past few months, and Rolland said she’s hoping to reopen the full center — which had classes and galleries — at a new location this summer.\nRolland’s interactions with Federal Emergency Management Agency workers in the storm’s aftermath were “wonderful,” she said. Criticism against the agency has been largely unwarranted, she said, because workers were in the region “almost on day one.”\nAnti-abortion protesters gather for the annual March for Life in Washington\nDespite frigid weather, thousands of anti-abortion protesters gathered to celebrate a new Republican trifecta in the presidency and both chambers of Congress as they returned to the nation’s capital Friday for the annual March for Life.\nA festive atmosphere marked the early part of the march, as activists gathered with multicolored hats and signs declaring “Life is our revolution.”\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to address the crowd in a pre-recorded video as the gathering marks the first created_at that participants have been to the nation’s capital with him as the sitting president since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 decision, Roe v. Wade, that declared there was a constitutional right to an abortion.\nVice President JD Vance is slated to speak in person.\nKristen Cooper, 21, was among several thousand Students for Life America members attending. She said she was especially excited to be at the march with “pro-life Republicans” in the White House. She said this march was her fourth but the first with a Republican administration.\n“It’s surreal actually,” she said.\nFederal agencies begin removing DEI guidance from websites in Trump crackdown\nSeveral federal agencies have begun removing resources for underrepresented Americans from their webpages following President Trump’s executive order cracking down on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\nAgencies also have been cancelling training and service contacts to comply with the order from Trump, who vowed to dismantle diversity programs across the federal government. He has called for all DEI staff to be put on paid leave and eventually be laid off.\nDocuments on DEI have been removed from websites at agencies including the Office of Personnel Management, State Department and Department of Homeland Security. Web addresses that once led to DEI pages now display “Page Not Found — 404” messages or notes above archived material explaining the change.\n▶ Read more about the impact of Trump’s DEI executive order\nTrump expands use of fast-track deportation, which critics say is prone to mistakes\nThe Trump administration announced Friday that it is expanding a fast-track deportation authority nationwide, allowing immigration officers to deport migrants without appearing before a judge.\nThe administration said in a notice in the Federal Register on Friday that it is expanding the use of “expedited removal” authority so it can be used across the country. “The effect of this change will be to enhance national security and public safety — while reducing government costs — by facilitating prompt immigration determinations,” the administration said.\n▶ Read more about ‘expedited removal’ authority\nTrump says he’s considering ‘getting rid of FEMA’ as he visits hurricane-damaged North Carolina\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at Asheville Regional Airport where he was meeting with supporters and local officials about the recovery from last year’s Hurricane Helene, Trump says FEMA “has been a very big disappointment.”\nTrump said of the agency: “It’s very bureaucratic. And it’s very slow. Other than that, we’re very happy with them.”\nHe did not offer clear details on what he would replace it with, indicated he wants to move more of the disaster management responsibility to the states. That was a key priority of the conservative ’Project 2025” written by Trump’s supporters, including some who’ve since joined his administration.\n“A governor can handle something very quickly,” Trump said.\nTrump says OPEC+ can end the bloodshed in Ukraine by cutting oil prices\nThe president continued to make the case that reducing oil revenue is the key finding an endgame in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.\nTrump in his first days in office has centered his focus on the OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries, making the case that it has kept the price of oil too high for much of the nearly three-year war. Oil revenue is the engine driving the Russian economy.\n“One way to stop it quickly is for OPEC to stop making so much money. And they drop the price of oil because they have it nice and high,” Trump told reporters during a visit to Western North Carolina on Friday. “And if you have it high, then that war is not going to end so easily. So, OPEC ought to get on the ball and drop the price of oil. And that war will stop right away.”\nTrump continues to criticize FEMA\nPresident Trump landed in North Carolina to tour lingering damage from Hurricane Helene and said he would like to see states “take care of disasters” and that he was reviewing “the whole concept of “FEMA” the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which he’s criticized.\nTrump, speaking to reporters after he landed near Asheville, North Carolina, said it would be faster to let states respond to disasters.\n“Let the state take care of the tornadoes and the hurricanes and all of the other things that happen,” Trump told reporters.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines House of Representatives issued the following news release on Jan. 24, 2025:\nSpeaker Ferdinand Martin G. Romualdez on Wednesday (Switzerland created_at) reaffirmed the Philippines' unwavering stance on its territorial integrity as he expressed strong support for President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.'s firm policy on safeguarding Philippine sovereignty.\n\"President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. has been very, very firm on his policy that we should not give an inch of any Philippine territory,\" Speaker Romualdez said, speaking as a panelist during the Stakeholder Dialogue entitled \"Navigating Asia's Hotspots\" at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2025 in Davos, Switzerland.\n\"Having that been said, we celebrate, of course, our rules-based global order, and with the UNCLOS and the 2016 arbitral award recognizing the sovereignty of the Philippines, we stand steadfast with the President's policy in enforcing that,\" he added.\nHe was joined in the panel by Timor-Leste President Jose Ramos Horta, Indonesia's Foreign Minister Sugiono; Michael Froman, President of the Council on Foreign Relations; and Tulsi Naidu, Chief Executive Officer of Asia-Pacific, Zurich Insurance Group.\nHowever, Speaker Romualdez emphasized that the Philippines, under President Marcos Jr., has adopted a pragmatic and balanced approach to navigating the intensifying geopolitical competition between the United States and China, particularly in relation to the South China Sea issue.\nBalancing Geopolitical Interests\nDuring the panel, Speaker Romualdez underscored the Philippines' strategic position as an ally of the United States and a vital trade partner of China. He advocated for leveraging both relationships to advance the country's national interests.\nHe emphasized that the territorial dispute in South China Sea does not define the entirety of the Philippines' relationship with China.\n\"Despite the President being very firm on this policy of not giving up a single inch, we are working daily to de-escalate tensions. We do not want the South China Sea dispute to overshadow the many other facets of our relationship with China, including trade, education, and cultural exchanges,\" Romualdez said.\n\"We are not taking sides. The United States is our long-standing ally, and China is our largest trading partner.

At the same created_at, we remain proactive in fostering relationships with all nations to promote global collaboration,\" he said.\nEconomic Growth and Global Engagement\nSpeaker Romualdez highlighted the economic benefits of the Philippines' pragmatic foreign policy, noting its attractiveness to investors due to its robust GDP growth, youthful workforce and strategic location within ASEAN.\n\"We are here at the WEF to tell the Philippine story--of a nation full of potential and resilience. As part of ASEAN, we are at the heart of a dynamic growth region, and we are working to build stronger partnerships to unlock opportunities for trade and investment,\" he said.\nCiting engagements with industrial leaders from India as an example, Speaker Romualdez emphasized how the Indo-Pacific region, including the Philippines, is emerging as a key hub for global trade.\nCommitment to Peace and Cooperation\nReiterating the Philippines' role in fostering regional stability, Speaker Romualdez affirmed the nation's dedication to ASEAN centrality and multilateralism.\n\"ASEAN continues to play a vital role in ensuring regional peace and stability.

    "text": "\nIN getting down to business at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim came equipped with Malaysia's continuing pragmatism of non-alignment amidst increasingly treacherous geopolitical conflicts. Like all prime ministers before him, Anwar has cogently maintained the bedrock of Malaysia's diplomatic position: not being drawn into siding with one major superpower against another.\nIt's complicated. Malaysia's outright denunciation of Israel's unrelenting assault and genocide of Palestinians incurs the displeasure of the Americans, only because of its over-pampering of the lethal Zionist state. However, it doesn't mean that relations with the United States is tanking. Far from it. Malaysia still benefits from American foreign investments in decades of advanced computer chip production. Malaysia is also influenced by American soft power: its socio-political philosophy, media diet, Internet technology, literature, cuisine, entertainment and people-to-people interaction. In return, the US lives with Malaysia's foreign policy, though it hankers for a tougher stance against China akin to its own hostile position. Nothing doing. If Malaysia is friendly with America, we are just as friendly with China, given the historical links from the Middle Ages to current Chinese trade, tourism, infrastructural presence and socio-cultural affection.\nIn adopting this fine balance, Malaysia carefully stays clear of this belligerent contest, from threats of higher tariffs to TikTok's on-and-off ban, and flirtations with actual war in the South China Sea. The US and China are comfortable with Malaysia's neutrality, a recognition of our crucial and credible regional diplomatic activism as a founding member of Asean. Still, the often contradictory narratives shaped by the US-China's geopolitical tussle have often pushed many strategic countries, like Malaysia, to play a zero-sum game, which Anwar has dismissed. It's a high-powered tightrope fielding this duelling rhetoric. The US once projected itself as a mighty military nation defending liberalism, rules and norms. But lately, under the nihilistic tendencies of its new president, these cherished values are being scorched. If America commits to the \"yin\", the Chinese \"yang\" emphasises common interests, harmony and shared destiny, even if the Chinese military flexing in the South China Sea disturbs neighbouring nations.\nMalaysia accepts these battlefront narratives as complementary. What it won't accept is one side trouncing the other to reach hegemonic heights in the Asia-Pacific. To be sure, Malaysia's diplomatic conundrum is similar to other countries in the difficulties distinguishing between friends, allies, rivals and enemies. In dealing with America and China, Malaysia relies on a historic rule of thumb: America, despite its lofty global ideals, has waged constant wars, invasions and meddling since its 18th century inception. And the Yankees dropped two unnecessary but genocidal atomic bombs, the only nation to kill with a weapon of mass destruction. China, despite its militaristic overtures, went the opposite, investing in and buying up foreign lands in its Belt and Road Initiative to develop more enthusiastic â€” and uneasy friends.\n( END )\n"

    "text": "\nSpain will participate for the first created_at in a European military deployment in the Indo-Pacific. The frigate F-104 Méndez Núñez will join the battle group led by the British aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales, according to military sources. The Navy is already finalizing a deployment that will last five months, from April to September of this year.\nThe Méndez Núñez will participate in the first three phases of Operation Highmast, which will involve military units from up to 12 countries. The Spanish frigate will join the British carrier battle group on April 22 in the port of Portsmouth (United Kingdom) and will escort it until July 28, in Darwin (Australia), according to Navy sources. The frigate F-105 Cristóbal Colón was already in Australia in 2017, but then it was to instruct Australian sailors and support the sale of ships from the public shipyard Navantia.\nThe new deployment responds to the purpose of European countries to have a greater military presence in the Indo-Pacific, one of the hottest regions of the globe, with several disputes that threaten world peace, such as Beijing's claim to sovereignty over Taiwan or the dispute over the jurisdiction of the waters and islets of the South China Sea. Given the realization that the United States has shifted its strategic interest from the Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific, European countries are increasing their military effort in the area so as not to lose weight to their main ally. A French combat group led by the aircraft carrier Charles De Gaulle is in Southeast Asia and in mid-month carried out exercises in the Strait of Malacca, between Indonesia and Malaysia, while its Italian counterpart Cavour visited Japan last August as part of its first deployment in the region. Spain is studying the possibility of sending its flagship, the Juan Carlos I, to the Indo-Pacific in 2026 or 2027, although there is still no final decision.\nAt a minimum, the Battle Group led by HMS Prince of Wales will consist, in addition to the British aircraft carrier with its complement of fifth-generation F-35 fighter aircraft, of a supply ship, a nuclear attack submarine, several escort ships, such as frigates and destroyers, and the support of early warning and maricreated_at patrol aircraft operating from shore.\nThe objective of Operation Highmast, according to the organization, is to carry out a \"global deployment\", aimed at neutralizing a generic threat; without identifying any specific enemy. The document Visión Armada 2050, which analyzes the missions and needs of the Spanish Navy for the coming decades, presented last December, stresses that \"the world's economic center of gravity is shifting towards the Indo-Pacific, where the sea will gain relevance and it will be necessary to act within the framework of international coalitions\". For its part, the Maricreated_at Security Strategy 2024, approved by the National Security Council in March last year, includes the Indo-Pacific basin among the \"maricreated_at spaces of interest\" for Spain. \"The increase in strategic competition at the global level between great powers is already visibly manifested in geographical scenarios such as the Eastern Mediterranean, the Indo-Pacific or the South China Sea,\" it explains. Military sources admit that Washington's strategic priority is not in Ukraine, but in China, and add that the allies are fully aware of this and know that they must move if they do not want to end up irrelevant.\nThe Méndez Núñez, in service since 2006, is the fourth frigate of the F-100 series, the Navy's most modern, has a crew of 230 and is equipped with the Aegis combat system. It is not yet known which return route it will take from the created_at it leaves the European battle group in Australia until it arrives at its base in Ferrol in mid-September, but Navy sources assure that the design of the voyage is being carried out in accordance with Spanish strategic and commercial interests.\nThis is not the first deployment of the Spanish Armed Forces in the Indo-Pacific. Last year, four Eurofighter fighter planes and two A400M transport planes, with a detachment of 200 military personnel, passed through India, Japan and Australia as part of the Pacific Skies exercise, which took them around the world. This year it will be the Navy that will sail to the Antipodes.\n"

    "text": "\nBy Shaun Tandon\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio clashed with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi over Taiwan on Friday, with Donald Trump’s top diplomat denouncing Beijing’s “coercive” moves.\nRubio, a longcreated_at China hawk, spoke with Wang for the first created_at by telephone at the end of his first week in office, which he began by forming a united front with US partners in the region.\nIn the telephone call, Rubio told Wang that the second Trump administration will pursue a relationship with China “that advances US interests and puts the American people first,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said.\n“The secretary also stressed the United States’ commitment to our allies in the region and serious concern over China’s coercive actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea,” she said.\nSee also: Foreign policy heavyweights on Taiwan’s uncertain future \nWang in turn cautioned Rubio over Taiwan, the self-governing democracy which China claims and has not ruled out seizing by force.\n“We will never allow Taiwan to be separated from China,” Wang told Rubio, adding that Washington “must not betray its promise” to recognize only one China, according to a readout by the Chinese foreign ministry.\nWang voiced hope to Rubio that the former American senator would “play a constructive role for the future of the Chinese and American people, and for world peace and stability,” it said.\nIn their call, Wang told Rubio that the world’s top two economies should work to find “the right way to get along in the new era” — presumably referring to Trump’s return to the US presidency.\nWhile Beijing had “no intention of surpassing or replacing anyone,” it maintained its “legitimate right to development,” he said.\nThe Chinese minister said the pair should follow the lead of President Xi Jinping and Trump, who appeared to have a cordial telephone call.\nBoosting Taiwan\nThe United States is a longcreated_at supporter of Taiwan and its largest supplier of weapons, but does not formally recognize it diplomatically.\nIn his Senate confirmation hearing last week, Rubio vowed to ramp up support for Taiwan to achieve an “equilibrium” that would discourage China from an invasion.\nRubio suggested at the hearing that China could invade the island by the end of the decade unless the United States makes clear that “the costs of intervening in Taiwan are too high.”\nRubio has cast China as the top threat to the United States and has accused the Asian power — whose economy has skyrocketed in recent decades — of “cheating” its way toward superpower status.\nRubio met immediately Tuesday after taking office with the foreign ministers of Japan, India and Australia — the so-called Quad that China charges is an attempt to encircle it.\nThe four foreign ministers jointly warned against any “unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion,” in a clear reference to China.\nRubio also spoke by telephone with his counterparts from the Philippines and, on Friday, Vietnam.\nWith Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son, Rubio discussed China’s “aggressive behavior in the South China Sea,” the State Department said.\nChina has seen rising friction with Southeast Asian nations, especially the Philippines, as it asserts its claims in the strategic and dispute-rife waterway.\nHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team\nclass=\"newspack-popup-container newspack-popup hidden newspack-inline-popup newspack-lightbox-no-border \"\nrole=\"button\"\ntabindex=\"0\"\nstyle=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000\"\nid=\"id_483304\"\ndata-segments=\"\"\ndata-frequency=\"0,0,0,month\"\n>\nclass=\"wp-block-newspack-blocks-homepage-articles is-style-default wpnbha is-grid columns-4 colgap-3 show-image image-aligntop ts-2 is-3 is-uncropped show-caption is-style-default has-text-align-left has-text-color has-primary-color\"\nstyle=\"\"\n>\nLATEST FROM HKFP\nChina’s Wang Yi and new US top diplomat Marco Rubio clash over Taiwan in first phone call\n‘It’s inhuman’: Domestic worker in Hong Kong fired after seeking chemotherapy for breast cancer\nWhat are Hong Kong’s links to the Panama Canal, and does China really control the waterway as Trump claims?\nJimmy Lai’s email exchanges with US officials floated sanction targets, national security trial hears\nHKFP has an impartial stance, transparent funding, and balanced coverage guided by an Ethics Code and Corrections Policy. \nSupport press freedom & help us surpass 1,000 monthly Patrons: 100% independent, governed by an ethics code & not-for-profit.\n"

    "text": "\n A certain detail is conspicuously absent from State Department's account of a phone call reportedly made at the top American envoy's request   \nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a phone call with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Friday, affirming Washington does not back Taiwan independence, according to China's foreign ministry, a detail omitted from the American side's read-out. \n\"The United States does not support 'Taiwan independence' and hopes that the Taiwan issue will be peacefully resolved in a way accepted by both sides of the Taiwan Strait,\" Rubio said in a call that he requested, according to Beijing's foreign ministry. \nHowever, in the State Department's telling, Rubio \"stressed the United States' commitment to our allies in the region and serious concern over China's coercive actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea\". \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. \nMost countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons, as authorised by the Taiwan Relations Act.\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarification about the differing accounts of what was said about Taiwan. \nThe call marks the first direct contact Rubio has had with Beijing after a string of one-to-one engagements with counterparts throughout the Indo-Pacific region, including those in Japan and the Philippines. \nIn both those cases, their joint statements warned of a need to counter China's \"destabilising actions\" in the region. \nIn its read-out of Rubio's call with Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son, also on Friday, the State Department said they \"discussed regional concerns to include China's aggressive behaviour in the South China Sea\". \nFriday's calls follow one held a week prior between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping - days before the American leader was inaugurated for his second term. \nThe two in their call pledged to establish \"strategic channels of communication and maintain regular contacts on major issues of common interest\", according to a read-out from Beijing. \nTrump at the created_at posted on social media that the conversation was a \"very good one\" for both China and the US, saying the two \"will do everything possible to make the world more peaceful and safe\". \nAnd in an interview with Fox News late on Thursday in which he said Xi \"was like my friend\", Trump was asked whether he could strike a deal with China on trade practices and replied, \"I can do that.\" \n\"We have one very big power over China and that's tariffs and they don't want them and I'd rather not have to use it,\" Trump said. \nHe described his call with Xi as \"a good, friendly conversation\", adding that the Chinese leader \"was like my friend\". \nAs for Wang's exchange with Rubio on Friday, China's top envoy was said to have stated that \"we have no intention of surpassing or replacing anyone, but we must defend our legitimate right to development\", according to Beijing's report. \nWang also urged Rubio to \"play a constructive role for the future of the people of China and the US and for the peace and stability of the world\". \nThe State Department's read-out, meanwhile, said Rubio told Wang the Trump administration would pursue a bilateral relationship that \"advances US interests and puts the American people first\". \nRubio earned a reputation during his many years in the US Senate for espousing a hardline China policy. \nHe sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, for example, a law that authorised the sanctioning of more than a dozen officials from the semi-autonomous city and in mainland China. Beijing twice sanctioned him in 2020. \nThe first instance came in retaliation for US measures against senior Chinese officials over the treatment of ethnic minority Uygurs. The second was after mainland and Hong Kong officials were sanctioned following the 2019 protests in Hong Kong. \nWhile the recent phone calls carried signals of intent to continue bilateral engagement, a more hawkish message emerged from Capitol Hill on Friday. \nLawmakers in the US House announced they would reintroduce a bill that would require Trump to review whether Hong Kong officials should be sanctioned for human rights violations. \nAmerican lawmakers have long sought to punish authorities they deem responsible for a crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. \nAmong the dozens named in the bill sponsored by California Republican Young Kim are Hong Kong Justice Secretary Paul Lam Ting-kwok, Commissioner of Police Raymond Siu Chak-yee and judges Andrew Chan Hing-wai, Johnny Chan Jong-herng, Andrew Cheung Kui-nung, Alex Lee Wan-tang, Esther Toh Lye-ping and Amanda Woodcock. \nJim McGovern of Massachusetts, the bill's Democratic co-sponsor, was sanctioned by Beijing last year for \"frequently interfering\" in China's domestic affairs. \nAdditional reporting by Bochen Han in Washington\nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "text": "\nTensions in the West Philippine Sea escalated as Chinese maricreated_at forces allegedly harassed Philippine government vessels conducting a scientific survey near Sandy Cay, according to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).\nOn January 24, Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) vessels BRP Datu Pagbuaya and BRP Datu Bankaw, tasked with a marine scientific survey and sand sampling, faced aggressive actions from multiple Chinese Coast Guard ships and a Chinese Navy helicopter.\nThe BFAR vessels were intercepted by three Chinese Coast Guard shipsidentified as 4106, 5103, and 4202that executed dangerous maneuvers to block their path. Four smaller Chinese Coast Guard boats also targeted BFARs rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBs), which were transporting personnel.\nManila claimed the situation escalated further when a Peoples Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) helicopter, identified by tail number 24, hovered at a dangerously low altitude over the RHIBs. The propeller wash created hazardous turbulence, significantly increasing the risk of accidents.\nCommodore Jay Tarriela, the PCGs spokesperson, described the incident as a blatant disregard for the 1972 Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs).\nThe skilled seamanship of the BFAR crew prevented what could have been catastrophic accidents during these confrontations, Tarriela said.\nThe aggressive actions forced BFAR and PCG to suspend their survey operations, abandoning plans to collect sand samples from Sandy Cay. Tarriela expressed regret over the halted mission but reaffirmed the agencies commitment to safeguarding Philippine maricreated_at interests despite increasing risks.\nSandy Cay, located within the Philippines exclusive economic zone (EEZ), has been a focal point in ongoing maricreated_at disputes with China. In 2023, crushed and dead corals were discovered in Sandy Cay 2, which experts linked to activities preceding potential reclamation projects. Previous incidents included injuries to Filipino researchers when a Chinese Navy helicopter flew dangerously low, scattering debris.\nEnvironmental studies highlight Sandy Cays degraded condition, with low biodiversity and declining fish populations. Dr. Jonathan Anticamara from the University of the Philippines attributed this to overfishing, climate change, and human construction.\nChinas extensive claims in the South China Sea, overlapping with the EEZs of several Southeast Asian nations, continue to fuel regional tensions. The latest incident underscores Beijings disregard for the 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that invalidated its sweeping claims.\nThe West Philippine Sea is a critical global trade route, valued at over $3 trillion annually, making stability in the region a matter of international importance.\nMeanwhile, China has not commented on the Philippines latest allegations. On Friday, the China Coast Guard claimed that the Philippines dispatched a civilian vessel to resupply the grounded BRP Sierra Madre at Ren'ai Jiao after obtaining Chinese approval. China Coast Guard spokesperson Liu Dejun urged the Philippines to honor its commitments and cooperate with Beijing to maintain stability in the area. The BRP Sierra Madre, grounded in 1999, remains at Ren'ai Jiao despite the Philippines longstanding promise to remove it.\n"

Let Trump say whatever he wants! None of that affects us concretely. Moreover, we should take it with humor, as President Sheinbaum did in one of her mornings, in which she showed an old map in which the name of Mexican America appeared or as Hillary Clinton did during Trump's inauguration ceremony, in which she could not help but let out a laugh when the president insisted again on the subject.\nIt seems to me that we should not take lightly the issue of the name of that region of the planet. Just as the territorial domain has taken on a relevance that was supposedly lost -consider Trump's bid for the occupation of Greenland- the maricreated_at domain has also acquired an importance that cannot be ignored -think of the naval tensions in what some call the South China Sea and others would prefer it to have another name, precisely to undermine the legitimacy of the Asian power's claim to dominate that enormous maricreated_at extension that encompasses the coasts of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan-. It is no coincidence, therefore, that Trump's proposal to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico is made at the same created_at as his claim to U.S. control of the Panama Canal. It is the same thing: a redefinition of the maricreated_at borders of the United States in view of its national security in the 21st century.\nAlthough the Gulf of Mexico has borne that name for centuries, Mexico has never had naval control of that sea, not even of its coastal zone. During the viceroyalty, pirates ravaged its coasts. Later, when Mexico became independent, it did not have control of the region either. Suffice it to recall the humiliating ease with which foreign powers exercised blockades of Mexican ports in the Gulf, as happened during the war with the United States in 1847, the French intervention in 1862 and the U.S. occupation of Veracruz in 1914.\nBehind the change of name of the Gulf of Mexico is Trump's intention that this sea be controlled by the United States as a buffer to protect its coasts against any foreign threat, but, surely, also to appropriate and exploit all the natural wealth within its waters and on its seabed.\nI would not be surprised if the next step in Trump's strategy is to reclaim Baja California. During World War II, the United States wanted to install naval bases in the Baja California bays to protect its coast from possible incursions by Japanese submarines. The logic would be the same as the one behind the Gulf of Mexico and the Panama Canal.\nThe United States, China and Russia are moving their pieces on the chessboard of the planet. As if placing pawns on empty squares, the powers are preparing for what appears to be an inevitable global showdown. What we are seeing are the territorial preparations for World War III. For the same reason, we should not be surprised that the United States has declared the Mexican cartels as terrorist groups and, therefore, has arrogated to itself the right to intervene militarily in our country. In the event of a global conflict, the United States must be able to close its borders and have an immediate response capacity to any threat that arises in the vicinity of its territory.\nMexico already experienced something similar during World War II. To tell the truth, we did not fare so badly on that occasion. The country was part of the military alliance against fascism, but was able to protect its sovereignty in a way that is admirable. We owe much to the gallantry and good judgment of President Manuel Avila Camacho, who proved to be one of the great statesmen in Mexico's history. President Sheinbaum would do well to take him as a role model.\n"

    "text": "\nManila, Jan. 26 -- SPEAKING OUT\nThe recent redeployment of the US military's Typhon launchers from Laoag airfield to another location on Luzon has sparked significant attention and controversy. These launchers, equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles capable of hitting long distance targets, and SM-6 missiles designed for striking air or sea targets over 200 kilometers away, underscore the growing strategic importance of the Philippines in the Indo-Pacific missile race.\nChina's reaction to the deployment has been predictably harsh, accusing the Philippines of escalating tension and confrontation in the region. This response, however, must be viewed within the broader context of regional security dynamics. The presence of such advanced weaponry in the Philippines is part of a larger strategy by the United States to counterbalance China's military advancements and assert its own influence in the region.\nFrom a strategic standpoint, the redeployment of the Typhon launchers offers several advantages. It enhances the mobility and survivability of the missile batteries during potential conflicts, ensuring that they remain an effective deterrent. Moreover, it sends a clear message of the \"ironclad\" US defense commitment to the Philippines, as reiterated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in his discussions with Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique A. Manalo.\nThe Philippines, in turn, must navigate this complex geopolitical landscape with caution and prudence. While the US remains its major security partner, the country must also consider the implications of being a frontline state in the escalating tensions between major powers. The challenge lies in balancing national security interests with regional stability, ensuring that the pursuit of strategic alliances does not inadvertently fuel an arms race that could destabilize the entire region.\nUltimately, the redeployment of the Typhon launchers exemplifies the delicate balancing act that the Philippines must perform in its foreign policy. It is a reminder of the strategic importance of the country in regional security dynamics and the need for careful, measured actions to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.\nThe road ahead requires a clear-eyed understanding of the complexities at play, a commitment to upholding international law, and a steadfast dedication to protecting national interests. As we witness these unfolding events, it is imperative for the Philippines to continue to assert its sovereignty and pursue a balanced approach to regional security.

    "created_at": "2025-01-26",
    "text": "\n As Jakarta deepens military and coastguard cooperation while rejecting Beijing's sweeping claims, can it maintain a precarious equilibrium?   \nIndonesia is walking a fine line between bolstering ties with Beijing and preserving its long-standing non-aligned stance. As Jakarta ramps up military and coastguard cooperation with China, it sends a message of pragmatism to its Southeast Asian neighbours and the United States - but also risks raising questions about its long-standing non-aligned stance. \nThe signal is clear: Indonesia wants to remain an independent power broker in the region, even as Beijing's influence grows. From January 9 to 12, high-level meetings between Chinese and Indonesian defence officials - People's Liberation Army's chief of joint staff, Liu Zhenli met with Indonesia's Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin and military chief Agus Subiyanto during Liu's visit to Jakarta - resulted in promises of deeper cooperation, including joint exercises and personnel exchanges. \n\"It does not mean Jakarta is moving away from the West to be closer to China,\" said Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute's Southeast Asia programme. Instead, he told This Week in Asia that the moves reflect Indonesia's bebas dan aktif (independent and active) foreign policy - a strategy that allows it to work with both Beijing and Washington. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nBut the optics are nuanced. Jakarta's overtures come just weeks after it was forced to reassert its rejection of China's sweeping nine-dash line claim over the South China Sea. This followed a November joint statement, issued during Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto's visit to Beijing that month, which said the two countries had \"reached an important common understanding on joint development in areas of overlapping claims\". \nObservers warn that such agreements could muddy the waters - both literally and figuratively. Aristyo Darmawan, a lecturer in international law at Universitas Indonesia, said that while maricreated_at cooperation between coastguards can build trust and communication for \"whenever a crisis happens\", it should avoid areas of overlapping claims to prevent ambiguity. \n\"China may think now they have an overlapping claim with Indonesia,\" Aristyo told This Week in Asia. \"The cooperation should become a venue where Indonesia can reiterate our positions in regards to the South China Sea and nine-dash line, that we do not have any overlapping claim and do not recognise the nine-dash line.\" \nBeijing's nine-dash line claim to the disputed waterway has been rejected by Indonesia and other Southeast Asian nations, including the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. These rival claimants have largely steered clear of joint development projects with China, wary of legitimising Beijing's territorial ambitions. \nAristyo cautioned that Indonesia working together with China should not be misinterpreted as a shift in allegiance - even if the agenda behind such collaboration is \"China reiterating the cooperation based on an overlapping claim\". \n\"It might give a sense that we are too close and pro-China in the South China Sea and abandon our Asean colleagues,\" he said, referring to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations bloc. \nFor Beijing, increased cooperation with Indonesia couldn't have come at a better created_at, as it has faced increasing pushback from Southeast Asian states over its assertiveness in the South China Sea. \nAnalyst Ian Seow Cheng Wei, a master's student of politics and international relations at the University of Oxford, said Beijing had a point to prove. \"China aims to demonstrate to claimant states in the South China Sea the potential economic benefits of collaboration and to show that disputes can be managed peacefully,\" he said. \nThe first joint Heping-Garuda exercises between Indonesia and China, held last month, focused on search and rescue, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief - low-stakes operations that allow Beijing \"to deflect criticism of its assertiveness while portraying itself as a responsible regional power\", according to Seow. \nBut such exercises are unlikely to shift the balance of power in the South China Sea and contribute little to improving the military capabilities of either state. \n\"Exercises and cooperation with China are designed to develop close defence relations with Beijing, rather than learning advanced military operational and tactical skills and knowledge,\" Rahman told This Week in Asia. \nStill, last month's drills did mark one milestone: the first created_at China had deployed its Y-20 heavy-lift transport aircraft in a joint activity with a Southeast Asian nation other than Thailand. Seow suggested this could signal Indonesia's interest in acquiring Chinese-made military hardware, particularly to improve logistics and \"the delivery of resources and troops\" across its sprawling archipelago during an emergency. \nChina's most advanced Type 075 amphibious assault ship, the Hainan, also made its first foreign stop at Indonesia's Port of Tanjung Priok for a four-day replenishment last month. \n\"These activities can foster trust and build people-to-people relations between the militaries, which could prove valuable during emergencies,\" Seow said. \nIndonesia's balancing act is not without precedent. It previously held \"Sharp Knife\" counterterrorism drills with China, but suspended them in 2015 following a dispute about illegal Chinese fishing vessels. Both sides now appear eager to avoid letting maricreated_at disputes derail broader cooperation, however. \n\"Given that these exercises just resumed after nearly a decade, it will take created_at for both the Indonesian and Chinese militaries to understand each other and build trust, which is crucial for more complex activities,\" Seow said. \n\"Thus, it's likely that the joint military exercises between China and Indonesia will remain confined to addressing non-controversial and shared security concerns, such as terrorism and responding to natural disasters.\" \nThe question is whether Indonesia's strategy will pay off - or if its careful diplomacy will leave it caught in the crossfire of great-power competition. For now, Jakarta is betting that it can have it both ways: closer ties with Beijing without alienating Washington or its Asean neighbours. Whether that gamble succeeds remains to be seen.  \n"

    "text": "\nManila, Jan. 26 -- State Secretary Marco Rubio's statement reaffirming to Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo the United States' \"ironclad commitment\" to assist and defend the Philippines in the event of a hostile attack underscores the enduring significance of the US-Philippines alliance. This assurance, deeply rooted in the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT), resonates strongly in today's volatile geopolitical climate. However, it also invites a critical reflection on the consistency and effectiveness of such pledges, especially when viewed through the lens of past US administrations and the evolving dynamics of American foreign policy.\nThe Obama administration, with its Pivot to Asia strategy, laid a strong foundation for US engagement in the Indo-Pacific. It was under Obama that the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) was signed in 2014, allowing US forces greater access to Philippine military bases. These moves were aimed at counterbalancing China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea, where Philippine sovereignty has been repeatedly challenged. While the rhetoric was clear, tangible actions-particularly during the Scarborough Shoal standoff in 2012-did not match expectations, leaving some Filipinos questioning the extent of America's commitment.\nThe Trump 1.0 administration marked a shift with its America First policy, which prioritized domestic interests while projecting a transactional approach to alliances. Despite this, President Trump maintained cordial relations with then-President Rodrigo Duterte, choosing pragmatism over criticism of human rights issues. Military cooperation under Trump saw continuity, with increased joint exercises and arms sales, but the administration's broader withdrawal from global engagements somecreated_ats raised concerns about its reliability as a strategic partner.\nPresident Biden, upon assuming office, restored a more traditional, multilateral approach to foreign policy. His administration reaffirmed the US commitment to the MDT and took a firmer stance on the South China Sea, backing the 2016 arbitral ruling that invalidated China's expansive claims. This reassertion of US presence in the Indo-Pacific was welcomed but faced the challenge of navigating the increasingly complex relationships in the region, including China's growing influence over smaller states.\nNow, at the onset of Trump 2.0, the US leader declared a renewed emphasis on securing US dominance in global security, focusing on \"peace through strength.\" For the Philippines, Rubio's reiteration of US defense commitments takes on a new dimension under this doctrine.\nThe question remains: how will this administration translate its promises into action? Trump's first term demonstrated a mixed approach to alliances-often transactional and dependent on shared interests. While Duterte leveraged this to secure military aid, there were moments of uncertainty regarding America's willingness to confront Beijing head-on. This ambiguity, coupled with Trump's unpredictability, left Philippine policymakers cautious about fully relying on Washington.\nGiven these precedents, Rubio's statement must be viewed cautiously. While it reflects continuity in US-Philippines defense ties, the geopolitical realities today are far more complex. China's maneuvers in the South China Sea and its economic sway over ASEAN states require the US to go beyond mere verbal commitments.\nFor the Philippines, the renewed US pledge is a double-edged sword. While it offers reassurance in the face of external threats, it also demands careful balancing of relations with China, a major trading partner. The Marcos administration must craft a foreign policy that safeguards national security while maintaining economic stability.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

    "text": "\n 26 Jan 2025 (Philippines News agency) China's illegal activities on the country's waters are forcing the Philippines to defend itself and assert its rights, Department of National Defense (DND) Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. said.\n\"What is being done to the Philippines is forcible stealing of its rights, sovereign rights, in the exclusive economic zone which the Philippines has the sole right to explore, exploit resources in, by China. And doing this through not only words but through muscle,\" he said during a recent interview with Hoover Institution's \"Battlegrounds\".\nThe DND chief was referring to China's illegal activities in the West Philippine Sea where Chinese maricreated_at forces continue to swarm.\nThis was the offshoot of the Chinese enactment of a maricreated_at law that claimed almost all of the South China Sea (SCS) waters as internal waters of China.\n\"So what I'm trying to say right now is for the Philippines, what China is doing makes the Philippines, compels the Philippines to defend itself, assert its rights against China,' Teodoro said.\n'So they have themselves to blame. If we are choosing the side of the right, the correct, not the physical right, but the correct side, the correct path, to use their words, take the right path and correct route,\" he added.\nTeodoro said China is also trying to crowd out the country by \"trying to change narratives, trying to subvert our domestic economy, trying to influence others not to side with the Philippines.\"\nHe added it includes telling the world that the 2016 Arbitral Award is just 'a scrap of paper.'\nThe 2016 Arbitral Ruling is where the Permanent Court of Arbitration declared that the nine-dash-line of China has no legal basis.\n"

    "text": "\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a phone call with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Friday, affirming Washington does not back Taiwan independence, according to Beijing's foreign ministry, a detail omitted from the American side's read-out. \n\"The United States does not support 'Taiwan independence' and hopes that the Taiwan issue will be peacefully resolved in a way accepted by both sides of the Taiwan Strait,\" Rubio said in a call that he requested, according to the ministry.  \nHowever, in the State Department's telling, Rubio \"stressed the United States' commitment to our allies in the region and serious concern over China's coercive actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea\". \nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary.  \nMost countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons, as authorised by the Taiwan Relations Act. \nThe State Department and Beijing's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for clarification about the differing accounts. \nThe call marks the first direct contact Rubio has had with Beijing after a string of one-to-one engagements with counterparts throughout the Indo-Pacific region, including those in Japan and the Philippines. \nIn both those cases, their joint statements warned of a need to counter China's \"destabilising actions\" in the region.  \nIn its read-out of Rubio's call with Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son, also on Friday, the State Department said they ­\"discussed regional concerns to include China's aggressive behaviour in the South China Sea\". \nFriday's calls follow one held a week earlier between US President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping - days before the American leader was inaugurated for his second term. \nThe two leaders in their call pledged to establish \"strategic channels of communication and maintain regular contacts on major issues of common interest\", according to a read-out from Beijing. \nTrump at the created_at posted on social media that the conversation was a \"very good one\" for both China and the US, saying the two \"will do everything possible to make the world more peaceful and safe\". \nAnd in an interview with Fox News in which he said Xi \"was like my friend\", Trump was asked whether he could strike a deal with China on trade practices and replied, \"I can do that.\" \n\"We have one very big power over China and that's tariffs and they don't want them and I'd rather not have to use it,\" Trump said. \nHe described his call with Xi as \"a good, friendly conversation\", adding that the Chinese leader \"was like my friend\". \nAs for Wang's exchange with Rubio on Friday, China's top envoy was said to have stated that \"we have no intention of surpassing or replacing anyone, but we must defend our legitimate right to development\", according to Beijing's report.  \nWang also urged Rubio to \"play a constructive role for the future of the people of China and the US and for the peace and ­stability of the world\". \nThe State Department's read-out, meanwhile, said Rubio told Wang the Trump administration would pursue a bilateral relationship that \"advances US interests and puts the American people first\". \nRubio earned a reputation during his many years in the US Senate for espousing a hardline China policy. \nHe sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, for example, a law that authorised the sanctioning of more than a dozen officials from the city and the mainland. Beijing twice sanctioned him in 2020. \nThe first instance came in retaliation for US measures against senior Chinese officials over the treatment of ethnic minority Uygurs. The second was after mainland and Hong Kong officials were sanctioned ­following the 2019 protests in the city.  \nWhile the recent phone calls carried signals of intent to ­continue bilateral engagement, a more hawkish message emerged from Capitol Hill on Friday. \nLawmakers in the US House announced they would ­reintroduce a bill that would require Trump to review whether Hong Kong ­officials should be sanctioned for human rights violations.  \nAmong the dozens named in the bill sponsored by California Republican Young Kim are Justice Secretary Paul Lam Ting-kwok, Commissioner of Police Raymond Siu Chak-yee and judges Andrew Chan Hing-wai, Johnny Chan Jong-herng, Andrew Cheung Kui-nung, Alex Lee Wan-tang, Esther Toh Lye-ping and Amanda Woodcock. \nAdditional reporting by Bochen Han in Washington \n> China drives off ship A3\n"

As you know, there is a big election in your neighbour Germany next month. I know you will want to comment on that. You mentioned that if there was a peace deal, business as normal might come back. Are you worried that if there is a peace deal straightaway, for example the German businesses and industry will say \"Switch on the pipeline again\" and the same thing will happen again? Or do you think that pipeline, the gas flows from Russia, they should never come back again? TRANSLATION: I believe that the Nord Stream gas pipeline should be dismantled and I also want to say it was Donald Trump who stopped the construction on Nord Stream 2. That was his decision. He imposed sanctions on the companies involved in the construction of Nord Stream back in 2019 and thanks to him those constructions were stopped. I can only hope that European leaders visible in the photo depicting leaders opening Nord Stream will have lessons for later after the opening of Nord Stream. They will learn lessons from Russia's aggression against Ukraine and will push through decisions to never restore the pipeline of gas to Europe for one reason - because it poses a very big threat to the entire region of central Europe, to Ukraine, to Poland, to Slovakia, and also Central European countries. It is a threat from the point of view of energy, the military but also it is a huge economic threat because it means the domination of Russia over Europe in the economic sense. The German industry is suffering, there is an election - that message may be heard. They may be tempted to go for the cheap gas again. TRANSLATION: OK.

    "text": "\n Upon direct instructions of the President, we arranged for Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro, who flew into Washington D.C., to meet with newly appointed National Security Advisor Michael Waltz at the White House. After our short meeting with the National Security Advisor, we proceeded to have an expanded meeting with Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Alex Wong as well as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Andrew Byers and National Security Council Senior Director for Asia Ivan Kanapathy at the West Wing of the White House.\nBoth meetings were extremely productive, where we focused on serious security issues and the reaffirmation of the enduring alliance between the Philippines and the United States.\nSecretary Teodoro emphasized both nations' shared commitment to peace, stability and mutual security interests in the Indo-Pacific region, and the paramount importance of strengthening the bilateral defense ties between the Philippines and the United States to address emerging geopolitical challenges.\nThese meetings took place two days after the inauguration of President Donald Trump, making the Philippines one of the first countries to engage with the new administration - a very significant step in further advancing our longcreated_at alliance, with both sides expressing optimism in deepening defense and security cooperation in the years to come.\nAdditionally, there was also a telephone conversation between Foreign Affairs Secretary Ricky Manalo and State Secretary Marco Rubio in the morning (Washington DC created_at) on issues of mutual concern, among them the dangerous actions of China in the South China Sea that undermine regional peace and stability. They also exchanged views on advancing security cooperation and expanding economic ties for shared prosperity.\nSecretary Rubio, who underscored the 'ironclad' commitment of the US to the Philippines under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, certainly recognizes the importance of strengthening economic - not just defense or military - ties, for the bilateral relationship to be enduring.\n'When your engagement with a country leads to economic development, whether it's outbound US investment in the Philippines or what have you, then that becomes enduring. Then it makes it difficult, no matter who's in charge, to walk away from the alliance, because the alliance is more than just military and a military presence. It also involves jobs and businesses and investment and economic opportunity, and we need to look for ways to emphasize that. I think it would be a mistake to simply view it as a military or defense alliance,' Secretary Rubio stated during his confirmation hearing.\nWe are looking forward to working closely with Secretary Rubio's team at the State Department in advancing shared priorities and strengthening US-Philippines ties even further.\nAs I have emphasized on several occasions, we have strong support from both Republicans and Democrats, and we will continue to work with them on issues that are mutually beneficial - because this relationship is a two-way street. I also know that the US sees the Philippines as an important ally, especially at this created_at. This bipartisan support from members of the US Congress was evident during my meeting last Thursday at the US Capitol with Democratic Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who is a member of the Senate foreign relations committee.\n'Ambassador Romualdez and I had a constructive discussion about opportunities and challenges in the Indo-Pacific. We discussed how we can better coordinate and strengthen US military and economic support to the Philippines and further elevate our alliance,' he shared in his website, adding, 'We have a long, close relationship with the Philippines and the Filipino people, and our commitment to the US-Philippine alliance remains ironclad.'\nDuring the inauguration of President Trump and the social events that followed shortly thereafter, I also had the opportunity to engage with 'old and new faces' who will be taking on important roles in the Trump administration for the next four years to bring our relationship to even greater heights. We also hosted a reception at the Philippine embassy, bringing together representatives from the new government, the US Congress and members of the media, among several other sectors.\nIn my interview with Karen Davila of ANC, I amply described how our relationship with the United States will be like under the new Trump administration. Naturally, an issue of great concern is the new immigration policy and its impact on the estimated 350,000 undocumented Filipinos in the United States.\nClear instructions have already been given to all consulates general in the United States on what we can do to help our kababayans regardless of their immigration status. Early this month, we met with members of a group called Filipino American Legal Defense and Education Fund (FALDEF) to discuss the challenges faced by undocumented Filipinos and shared insights on how those affected can have access to legal counsel and how they can have a legal path to stay in the US. FALDEF representatives led by their president Jose Teodoro Mallonga are also offering pro bono legal services and partnering with other Filipino community organizations to strengthen the support network for vulnerable groups.\nThe embassy and our consulates general all over the US are likewise continuing efforts to disseminate information about the rights of all Filipinos in the US, regardless of their immigration status, through our websites and social media platforms, providing information from the US Department of Labor, migration offices of states, immigration centers and various sources.\nAs always, the Philippine embassy will do what we can in assisting all Filipinos regardless of status. But as I told Karen, the bottom line advice to our fellow Filipinos is to follow a legal path - if one wants to have peace of mind.\n"

He said that the two sides will conduct joint exercises by their respective disaster management teams.\n\"Crime prevention, search and rescue, and capacity building will be strengthened after the signing of the maricreated_at security pact,\" he said.\nModi described Indonesia as an \"important partner\" of India in the 10-nation ASEAN bloc as well as in the Indo-Pacific, noting that both countries are committed to a rules-based order in the region.\n\"We agree that the freedom of navigation should be ensured in line with international law,\" Modi said amid growing global concerns over China's increasing assertive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region.\nSubianto is seen to have made concessions on the South China Sea issue in September 2024. A China-Indonesia joint statement in English agreed to jointly develop \"areas of overlapping claims\". This implied a shift in Indonesia's previous stance to one that recognised China's nine-dash line. However, shortly thereafter, Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement in Indonesian, clarifying that the joint statement does not imply Indonesia's recognition of the nine-dash line.\nBoth sides also agreed to cooperate on Fintech, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things and Digital Public Infrastructure. Modi said India has shared its experiences in implementing the Mid-day meal scheme and public distribution system. Secretary (East) in MEA Jaideep Mazumdar said that Subianto is replicating the mid-day meal scheme in Indonesian schools.\nModi also said that they have agreed to cooperate in the fields of energy, critical minerals, space and STEM education.\nHe welcomed Indonesia in the BRICS grouping, and said that the two countries work together in G20 and ASEAN groupings.\nReferring to Modi as my \"good brother\", Subianto said that the Indonesian side will send a high-level defence delegation to India to follow up on the recent ratification of the defence pact.\nCalling the talks \"very frank,\" Subianto said: \"I have given directions to our officials that we need to accelerate the economic partnership with India.\"\nThe Indonesian President emphasised on economic cooperation, and asked Indian investors and companies to come and participate in the infrastructure development in Indonesia. Mazumdar said that Subianto had invited Indian companies to develop ports including the Sabang port.\nHe also said that he has \"given direction to the team to expedite and cut bureaucracy, cut too much over regulation\" to pursue common bilateral interest and \"increase economic partnership\" with India.\nThe Indonesian President pitched for stronger educational cooperation, increase of Indonesian students studying in India and invited Indian educational institutions to open campuses in Indonesia. Indian officials said that he has also asked Indian medical colleges to open campuses there. Also, Indian hospitals are in talks with Indonesian authorities to open hospitals there.\nSubianto thanked the Indian government for the invitation. He had visited India as Defence minister in 2020. He recalled that India had invited then Indonesian President Sukarno for the first Republic Day parade in 1950. He also said that India was one of the co-founders of the Non-Aligned Movement, after the Bandung conference and is now championing South-South cooperation, as the \"voice of the Global South\".\nPresident Subianto is the fourth Indonesian leader invited by India to attend its Republic Day celebrations as chief guest: In 1950, when India celebrated its first Republic Day, it was President Sukarno. The choice of chief guest every year is dictated by a number of reasons - strategic and diplomatic, business interest and international geo-politics.\nThis year, a 352-member marching and band contingent from Indonesia will participate in the Republic Day parade. It's the first created_at an Indonesian marching and band contingent is taking part in a national day parade abroad. The President thanked the Indian government for the opportunity. He also invited PM Modi to visit Indonesia.\nEarlier in the day, he met President Droupadi Murmu and was accorded the ceremonial welcome at the Rashtrapati Bhawan. He is on a three-day visit to India beginning Thursday night, and had met External Affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday.\nHe also went to the Bahrisons bookshop in Khan Market.\nIndia-Indonesia bilateral ties were elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership when Prime Minister Modi paid an official visit to Indonesia in 2018. During that visit, the Shared Vision of India-Indonesia Maricreated_at Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific was also adopted.\nModi also met Subianto on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil on November 19, 2024. This was the first meeting between the two leaders.\nSince the adoption of India's 'Look East Policy' in 1991, and its upgradation to 'Act East' in 2014, there has been a rapid development of bilateral relations.\nIndonesia chaired the G20 Presidency in 2022, followed by India in 2023. Sources said that the two sides worked in tandem to talk to the Russians and the US-led Western bloc to arrive at a joint communique at the G20 leaders' summits in Bali and New Delhi - reflecting their shared understanding.\nSubianto is likely to maintain a good relationship with the newly elected US President Donald Trump . When Trump won, Subianto was one of the first world leaders to call and congratulate him. When Trump complimented his English, Subianto reportedly replied, \"All my training is American, Sir.\"\nThat said, Subianto is expected to continue with his non-aligned policy that avoids taking sides in the US-China rivalry.\nIndonesia is one of India's largest trading partners in the ASEAN region, with bilateral trade in 2023-24 reaching $29.40 billion. Indian investments in Indonesia amounts to $1.56 billion in infrastructure, power, textiles, steel, automotive, mining, banking and consumer goods sectors.\nBut, since trade is lopsided in Indonesia's favour - Indonesia exports $24 billion and India exports about $6 billion - there was discussion about increasing Indonesian imports from India.\n"

    "text": "\nChinese coast guard ships and a Chinese navy helicopter harassed a group of Philippine fisheries vessels conducting a scientific survey in a hotly disputed area of the South China Sea, forcing them to cancel the operation, the Philippine coast guard said Saturday.\nBeijing has repeatedly asserted sovereignty over most of the South China Sea and accused rival claimant states, including the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia of encroachment. China has demarcated its territorial claims with a 10 dashed-line printed on maps but has not provided the exact coordinates.\nThe incident took place Friday near Sandy Cay, three small uninhabited sandbars flanked by an artificial island base of Chinese forces and a Philippines-occupied island in the Spratlys archipelago, the coast guard said.\nThe Chinese coast guard ships approached two larger vessels, which maneuvered to avoid a collision, and a navy helicopter flew low over two smaller boats deployed by the ships, forcing the survey to be called off.\nA Chinese coast guard statement said that it drove the Philippine ships away after they entered the waters without China's permission and attempted to land on the cay - which is called Tiexian Reef in Chinese - and conduct sand sampling.\nVideos released by the Philippine coast guard show a Chinese coast guard ship sailing very close to a vessel officials identified as belonging to the Philippines. Another video shows a Chinese military helicopter hovering low over the rough seas near a vessel flying a Philippine flag.\nThe latest flare-out of the long-simmering territorial disputes in one of the world's busiest trade and security passageways could test President Donald Trump's commitment to maintain America's role as a counterweight to China, which has increasingly carried out assertive actions in the disputed waters.\nHis predecessor, Joe Biden, strengthened an arc of security alliances in Asia while in office in a bid to curb China's aggressive actions in the South China Sea, East China Sea and around Taiwan, a self-governed island which Beijing has vowed to take by force if necessary.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio in a telephone call last week with his Philippine counterpart, Enrique Manalo, discussed issues of mutual concern, including \"the People's Republic of China's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.\nRubio \"conveyed that the PRC's behavior undermines regional peace and stability and is inconsistent with international law,\" Bruce said in a readout of the call.\nRubio \"underscored the United States' ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defense Treaty,\" Bruce said.\nBiden and his administration had repeatedly warned China that the U.S. is obligated to help defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under armed attack including in the South China Sea. China has warned the U.S. to stay away from what it says is a purely Asian dispute.\nIn 2017, China accused the Philippine military of secretly plotting to occupy and build a structure on one of the three sandbars, about 2.5 nautical miles  from the Philippine-occupied Thitu Island, two senior Philippine officials told The Associated Press at the created_at.\nChina protested and surrounded the sandbars with three navy ships, a coast guard ship and 10 suspected militia ships, according to a confidential Philippine government security report seen by the AP at the created_at.\nChinese and Philippine diplomats resolved the issue by agreeing that forces from both sides should not set foot on the sandbars, the two Philippine officials said.\nChinese ships, however, have continuously kept watch off the sandbars since then, according to the Philippine military.\nSeparately, the Philippine coast guard said it has been ordering Chinese coast guard ships to stay away from the Scarborough Shoal, another disputed area about 124 nautical miles off the northwestern Philippines.\nThe Chinese coast guard ships have approached up to 60 nautical miles from the Philippines coast in recent weeks, well within the country's exclusive economic zone, a stretch of water where a coastal state has exclusive rights to tap resources, but where foreign ships have rights of \"innocent passage\" as provided under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Philippine coast guard said.\nThe Chinese coast guard has defied the Philippine coast guard order to leave the area, which it said falls within Chinese waters. It warned the Philippines \"to immediately stop all infringement activities, provocations and false accusations.\" JIM GOMEZ, MANILA,MDT/AP\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nA Chinese Coast Guard boat sails around Sandy Cay in the South China Sea, last week\n"

    "text": "\nSouth Korea should increase efforts to prevent China from normalizing its claims to sovereignty over a disputed maricreated_at area in waters the two countries share, analysts say.\nChina has been doing it for decades in the South China Sea, analysts say, where it has been using so-called gray zone tactics to assert its claims over vast stretches of maricreated_at territory - claims contested by several neighboring countries in the area.\nRecent Chinese activity in the waters it shares with South Korea has prompted analysts' warnings that Beijing is doing the same to Seoul.\nSouth Korean officials said earlier this month that China had installed a steel structure in disputed waters west of South Korea, The Chosun Daily in Seoul reported.\nUsing reconnaissance satellites, South Korean intelligence agencies detected the structure last month and estimate that it exceeds 50 meters in width and height, The Chosun Daily said.\nThe structure was spotted in the disputed area known as the Provisional Measures Zone, or PMZ, in the Yellow Sea, which South Korea calls the Western Sea. The zone is where the exclusive economic zones of the two countries overlap.\nThe zone was established in 2001 to manage the overlapping claims to the area. Building any kind of facility and conducting activities unrelated to fishing are banned in the area until the dispute is settled.\n'Gray zone strategy'\n\"It is likely that these recent actions are tied to a gray zone strategy that slowly encroaches on this area in ways that over the long-term reinforces their claims,\" said Terence Roehrig, an Asia-Pacific security expert and lecturer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\"The goal of a gray zone strategy is to slowly force the target state to accept a new normal in the area. Seoul must ensure that does not happen by continuing to assert its position and insist that the delimitation of these waters be settled through negotiation,\" Roehrig continued.\n\"China views the Yellow Sea as a crucial area for its security and potential gateway into the Chinese heartland. It is likely that eventually, these structures may have some military use,\" he added.\nGray zone tactics blur the line between what is legal and illegal through paramilitary coercions designed to weaken an adversary over created_at. China's tactics have included building artificial islands and making incursions, pushing the boundary of what is allowed to project military power and control sea routes.\n\"The incident demonstrates China is using the same strategy it employed in the South China Sea with South Korea now,\" said Rahman Yaacob, research fellow for the Southeast Asia program at the Lowy Institute.\nAccording to Yaacob, China has used gray tactics to build civilian structures in the South China Sea since the early 1990s. China installed structures in Mischief Reef back then, saying their purpose was to support fishermen, he said.\n\"We now know Mischief Reef has been converted into a military base on an artificial island,\" Yaacob said.\nChina now has a military base on an artificial island it built on Mischief Reef, which is in the Spratly Islands. Mischief Reef is also claimed by multiple countries that protest China's military buildup.\nAdmiral John Aquilino, the former U.S. Indo-Pacific commander, said in 2022 that China seemed to have completed the construction of missile arsenals, aircraft hangers, radar systems and other military facilities in Mischief Reef.\nDavid Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, said China might want access to \"the mineral rights under the sea and to be able to transit freely in the area so it can control commerce and flow of activities in the area\" close to South Korea.\nSustained structures in the region could impact naval operations of South Korea and the U.S., he continued.\n\"It's important that South Korea, in particular, but also the United States, Japan and other allies do not allow China to normalize its activities,\" Maxwell added. \"That's what it wants to do - normalize its presence so it can claim it as its sovereign [maricreated_at] territory.\"\nIn response to South Korea's protests, China said last year that the structures were for supporting fishing activities. The Yellow Sea is a key fishing site for China.\n\"It's certainly possible that the structures are used to support fishing activities,\" said Tabitha Grace Mallory, a founder and CEO of China Ocean Institute and a University of Washington professor focusing on China's ocean policy.\n\"The fact that these structures are being built unilaterally in the PMZ is just unnecessarily provocative,\" she added.\nTelling VOA on Tuesday that he is \"not familiar with the situation,\" Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said, \"I would like to point out that China is a responsible country that has always carried out distant-water fishery and marine scientific activities in accordance with laws and regulations.\"\nExploiting political turmoil\nSome analysts say China could be taking advantage of Seoul's political situation to install the structure in the disputed waters.\nThe installation coincides with the political chaos stemming from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived declaration of martial law.\n\"China is helping to create the political chaos in South Korea so that it can conduct these activities inside South Korea's economic exclusive zone\" and \"act with impunity,\" Maxwell said.\nOthers are unsure whether the two incidents are related.\n\"I don't know if this is explicitly tied to exploiting [South Korea's] political turmoil,\" said Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation chair in Korea studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\"But Beijing may be testing South Korea's political resolve over disputed maricreated_at claims, especially if we anticipate that the Trump administration will press [Seoul] to do more to counter Chinese threats in the Indo-Pacific,\" Yeo continued.\nPatrick Cronin, the Asia-Pacific security chair at the Hudson Institute, said Beijing does not want to push South Korea too hard, although it has an opportunity to do so, because \"China has an interest in opening a healthy relationship with South Korea, especially at a created_at when it thinks it is going to have a more amendable government in place.\"\nCronin was referring to main opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, considered pro-China, having a shot at running for the next presidential election, which could be held in few months if the Constitutional Court rules in favor of Yoon's impeachment. - VOA\n"

We do not want the South China Sea dispute to overshadow the many other facets of our relationship with China, including trade, education, and cultural exchanges, Romualdez said.\nWe are not taking sides. The United States is our long-standing ally and China is our largest trading partner. The Philippines is navigating a middle path where we maximize opportunities from both relationships while actively participating in the broader global community, he added.\nOn the bilateral ties with the US, Romualdez welcomed recent reassurances from new Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the Mutual Defense Treaty and Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, noting their alignment with the Philippines' strategic priorities.\nReports said that in a call with his Philippine counterpart, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo, Rubio underscored the United States' ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defense Treaty.\nOur enduring alliance with the United States strengthens our ability to safeguard sovereignty and pursue peace. At the same created_at, we remain proactive in fostering relationships with all nations to promote global collaboration, he said.\nEconomic growth, global engagement\nRomualdez likewise highlighted the economic benefits of the country's pragmatic foreign policy, noting its attractiveness to investors due to its robust gross domestic product (GDP) growth, youthful workforce, and strategic location within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\nWe are here at the WEF to tell the Philippine story -- of a nation full of potential and resilience. As part of ASEAN, we are at the heart of a dynamic growth region, and we are working to build stronger partnerships to unlock opportunities for trade and investment, he said.\nHe emphasized how the Indo-Pacific region is emerging as a key hub for global trade, citing as example the Philippine government's engagements with industrial leaders from India.\nCommitment to peace, cooperation\nReiterating the Philippines' role in fostering regional stability, Romualdez affirmed the nation's dedication to the ASEAN centrality and multilateralism.\nASEAN continues to play a vital role in ensuring regional peace and stability. The Philippines remains committed to this multilateral framework, which has proven effective in addressing challenges while promoting cooperation, he said.\nHe reiterated the Philippines' commitment to a balanced and pragmatic foreign policy, rooted in upholding sovereignty, fostering economic growth, and pursuing peaceful international collaboration.\nOur future lies in de-escalating tensions, building meaningful partnerships, and safeguarding our principles. The Philippines is prepared to navigate the complexities of geopolitics, ensuring that our people benefit from peace, prosperity, and stability, he said. - PNA\n"

    "text": "\nGlobal created_ats: It's reported that Chinese research institutions have completed the tests and analysis of the first independent sampling of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water discharged into the sea. Could you share more details with us?\nMao Ning: To ensure independent sampling and monitoring by China and other stakeholders is one of the commitments made by Japan on the issue of the discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the sea. We learned from relevant authorities that Chinese research institutions have completed the tests and analysis of China's first independent sampling. No abnormality was seen in the activity concentration of tritium, caesium-137 and strontium-90.\nGlobal created_ats: Does the test result prove the safety of the discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the sea?\nMao Ning:The discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water concerns the world's common interest. Japan's unilateral action taken in spite of concerns of neighboring countries and the international community lacks legitimacy and rationality. China's firm opposition to Japan's discharge of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the sea remains unchanged. In the absence of any compulsory international mechanism to stop the discharge, independent sampling by stakeholder countries on a continuous basis as a method of monitoring is an effective way to control the risks that come with the discharge.\nMeanwhile, we noted that professional agencies pointed out that one single test provides limited reference. China will continue to work with the international community to urge Japan to fulfill its commitments, put the discharge under strict international oversight and continue the independent sampling and monitoring of the water.\nAFP: The new US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had a call yesterday with his Philippines counterpart Enrique Manalo. A State Department spokesperson said that Rubio underscored the United States' ironclad commitments to the Philippines under the countries' mutual defense treaty and that the two also discussed Beijing's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea. Does the Foreign Ministry have a reaction to this call?\nMao Ning: China's activities in relevant waters are legitimate, lawful, and fully justified. The US is not a party to the South China Sea issue and has no right to interfere in the maricreated_at issues between China and the Philippines. The military cooperation between the US and the Philippines should not undermine China's sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests in the South China Sea, still less should such cooperation support or advance the Philippines' illegal claims. China will continue to take necessary steps to firmly safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests and uphold peace and stability in the South China Sea.\nBeijing Daily: The White House said a few days ago that the US will withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Comments say that this will cast a cloud over the global effort of climate response and green transition. What is your view on this?\nMao Ning: China regrets the US announcement of withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Climate change is a common challenge facing all humanity. No country can opt out or stay unaffected.\nAs Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang pointed out in his special address at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2025, we must follow a consistent approach in addressing climate change. The fundamental solution to climate change is green transition. China is accelerating green and low-carbon transition across the board and taking concrete actions to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. China has built the world's largest and most complete new energy industrial chain. 70 percent of the photovoltaic components and 60 percent of wind power equipment worldwide come from China. These high-quality production capacity has served as a strong boost to global green development and climate response.\nNo matter how the international landscape may evolve, China's determination and action for proactive climate response will not change, and we will continue working with all parties to build a fair and equitable global climate governance system for win-win cooperation and advance global green and low-carbon transition and sustainable development.\nAFP: I'd like to follow up on a question yesterday about a Chinese mine worker who had reportedly been killed in Afghanistan's northern Takhar province. Since then, the Islamic State's regional chapter has claimed responsibility for the attack, according a monitoring group called site. This monitoring group said that IS issued a communiqu\\xE9 reporting that fighters fired at a vehicle containing a Chinese. Does the Foreign Ministry have further information today or comments on this incident?\nMao Ning: China is deeply shocked at the attack and strongly condemns it. We express our condolences over the lives lost. China has lodged serious protests to Afghanistan right after the attack, and asked the country to conduct thorough investigations into the attack, and bring the perpetrators to justice.\nChina firmly opposes all forms of terrorism and calls for resolute and strong efforts in cracking down on ISIS, the ETIM and other terrorist organizations designated by the UN Security Council with zero tolerance. China will closely follow the security situation in Afghanistan and continue supporting Afghanistan in combating all forms of terrorism and violence, and upholding national security and stability. We urge the Afghan interim government to take resolute and effective measures to ensure the safety and security of Chinese citizens, institutions and projects in Afghanistan.\nKyodo News: A people's court in Suzhou today handed down a ruling on the case of attack against a Japanese woman and her child last June, and the Chinese defendant was sentenced to death. What is China's comment?\nMao Ning: From what I have gathered, the case is in judicial process and China's judicial authorities will handle the case in accordance with law. China will, as always, act to protect the safety of foreign nationals in China.\nBloomberg: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has had a series of calls, mainly from US allies so far, part of his outreach to a growing list of countries including Japan, Australia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, UAE and the Quad. We're wondering, does China's Foreign Minister plan to speak with Mr. Rubio and can such a call take place given that Mr. Rubio has been sanctioned twice by China?\nMao Ning: I have no information to share on your question. Let me say more broadly that it's necessary for high-level Chinese and U.S. officials to engage each other in appropriate ways. In the meancreated_at, China will firmly defend its national interests.\nCCTV: A follow-up on the test result of the discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water. Does a normal test result mean that China will resume imports of Japanese aquatic products?\nMao Ning: The Chinese government always puts people first and firmly safeguards the food safety of our people. On the issue of resuming imports of Japanese aquatic products, China always follows a science-based approach. The first independent sampling and testing is just one of the steps for Japan to implement its commitments on the discharge issue. The resumption of Japanese aquatic products depends on results from a series of data including those from China's continuous independent sampling and monitoring and whether Japan will take concrete measures to effectively guarantee the quality and safety of exported aquatic products to China.\nReuters: According to a Reuters report today, the US deployed its Typhon missile launchers to a new location in the Philippines. A senior Philippine government source said that their redeployment would help determine where and how fast the missile battery could be moved to a new firing position. I just wanted to ask for any comments on the report.\nMao Ning: On the US deployment of Mid-Range Capability missile system in the Philippines, China has made clear its opposition more than once. Let me stress again that by bringing this strategic offensive weapon into this part of the world, the Philippines is essentially creating tensions and antagonism in the region and inciting geopolitical confrontation and an arms race. This is a highly dangerous move and an extremely irresponsible choice for its own people, the people of the other Southeast Asian countries, and regional security.\nWe once again call on the Philippines to heed the call from regional countries and their peoples, correct the wrongdoing as soon as possible, quickly pull out the Typhon missile system as publicly pledged, and stop going further down the wrong path.\nReuters: The Financial created_ats reported on Wednesday that two Iranian cargo vessels carrying an ingredient for missile propellant will sail from China to Iran in the next few weeks, potentially subjecting the involved Chinese entities to US sanctions. I wanted to ask for a comment on that report.\nMao Ning: I am not familiar with what you mentioned. China strictly controls the export of dual-use articles in accordance with laws and regulations on export control and our international obligations. China opposes any illicit unilateral sanctions.\nReuters: More than half of the American businesses in China say they are concerned about a further deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the economies, according to a survey from the US Chamber of Commerce. That's the highest level in five years. Do you have any comment on that report?\nMao Ning: This actually reflects how important it is to pursue a steady, sound and sustainable China-U.S. relationship. China always views and develops China-U.S. ties in line with the three principles put forth by President Xi Jinping, namely mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. We also hope the U.S. will work with China and bring China-U.S. relations back onto the track of sound and steady development.\nSource: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China\n"

    "text": "\nBy Zhang Zhouxiang | China Daily | Updated: 2025-01-27 07:28\nThe Philippine National Bureau of Investigation has arrested a Chinese national along with two Filipinos for alleged espionage activities in the Philippines. The Chinese embassy in the Philippines has denounced the allegation as \"baseless speculation\" and made solemn representations to the Philippine side, demanding consular access to the arrested Chinese citizen who has been in the country for five years.\nIt has urged the Philippine side to base its judgment on facts, not to make a presumption of guilt, and to stop airing groundless speculation about the so-called spy case.\nThe attitude of the Chinese embassy cannot be clearer: Manila's charges are baseless, and the arrested Chinese citizen deserves fair treatment.\nThat the incident happened only weeks after a Philippine government vessel deliberately crashed into a China Coast Guard ship in waters near Huangyan Island in the South China Sea in December has naturally led to speculation that the Philippines is using the trumped-up scare as a means to speculate against China and ensure it has the support of the United States under the new administration.\nBut by doing so Manila is only losing its strategic independence in foreign policy, which will only mean more losses than gains to it in the long run.\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry has already called on the Philippine side to duly fulfill its obligations under the bilateral consular treaty, arrange for embassy officials to conduct a consular visit with the Chinese citizen at an early date, and effectively safeguard the lawful rights and interests of Chinese citizens in the Philippines.\nBy pouring dirty water on a Chinese citizen in the Philippines to incite speculation about Chinese \"espionage\" activities, the Philippine side is stooping very low.\nLink to Image\n"

Danilo Ramon S. Fernandez said the joint committee on public safety, public information and communications technology will convene on Monday with representatives from “major social media platforms” to formulate policies stifling the spread of disinformation.\nThe committee plans to discuss efforts to curb the spread of false information on social media platforms and the enforcement of “accountability measures” to persons deliberately spreading disinformation, he said.\nThey would also discuss the impact of disinformation campaigns on national security, especially on the “West Philippine Sea” dispute, he added, referring to areas of the South China Sea within Manila’s exclusive economic zone.\n“Filipinos have the right to the truth. We must protect our fellow citizens against falsehoods that cause fear, confusion, and division within our society,” Mr. Fernandez said in Filipino.\nAbout 62% of Filipinos get their news from social media, particularly on Facebook, according to a 2024 survey by political consultancy firm Publicus Asia.\nThe widespread use of social media in the country inundates Filipinos with content peddling misinformation and disinformation. This was most pronounced during the 2022 national elections, according to a University of the Philippines report.\nFilipinos will again flock to polling stations for the 2025 midterm elections in May, when a new set of congressmen for the House and 12 of the 24-member Senate will be voted on.\n“Fake news is a poison destroying our democracy. We will not stop until those responsible are held accountable and our fellow citizens are properly protected,” said Mr. Fernandez.\n"

    "text": "\n The Philippines and France have more things in common than most people think. Both the Philippine archipelago as well as French territories are part of the Indo-Pacific. Both are blue nations-maricreated_at states that are home to a vast range of marine ecosystems and resources. These, in turn, support the livelihoods of their communities and contribute to their economies, boosting their tourism sectors.\nIt follows that our two nations also share similar maricreated_at risks and challenges.\nForemost among these are the vulnerabilities that arise from being maricreated_at nations. France and the Philippines are confronted by various forms of danger like climate change and environmental issues-rising sea levels, stronger cyclones, and biodiversity loss. There are also issues that result from illegal fishing and construction. For us, this means areas such as the West Philippine Sea (WPS).\nA bigger challenge, however, is the aggressive actions and maneuvers of other countries intent on subverting the rule of law.\nIn recent months, the Philippines has seen China firing water cannons, directing lasers to crews, and blocking and ramming Philippine ships. These acts have jeopardized the safety of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), and national security. The fact that the South China Sea-facilitating one-third of global trade and is a maricreated_at area that houses vast fishery resources and hydrocarbon deposits-holds immense strategic and economic importance to Indo-Pacific states elevates the issue to that of great concern.\nIn response, the Marcos administration has demonstrated its commitment to addressing these external security challenges. Likewise, the Philippines is actively investing in its naval capacities, including diversifying its defense strategic cooperation with like-minded partners.\nFrance is also concerned with these developments in the WPS. It knows that any disruption of the vital maricreated_at routes would threaten global economic and trade security. Furthermore, foreign ships, such as those from France, regularly navigate the South China Sea to exercise freedom of navigation and concretely uphold international maricreated_at law.\nGiven our similar concerns and challenges, and given our shared commitment to and mutual respect for international law and appreciation for freedom of maricreated_at navigation, the Philippines has embarked on a strategic cooperation with France.\nThis does not only focus on the environment, climate change, and biodiversity but also on maricreated_at security and defense.\nAmong the steps that have been taken: In 2023, the two countries signed a letter of intent outlining an agenda for increasing France's presence in the Indo-Pacific. France participated in the 39th Balikatan in April 2024-its first created_at joining the biggest annual drill exercises of the Philippines with the US and other like-minded partners. In July 2024, a detachment of the French Air and Space Force PEGASE Mission visited the Philippines following its deployment in the Pacific as part of its air diplomacy and promotion of military cooperation actions with the Philippines.\nThe Philippines, through a P25.8-billion Official Development Assistance funded acquisition project of France, is set to receive 40 fast response craft, the largest single-purchase in the Modernization of the PCG.\nIndeed, 2024 was a year of firsts; this year will see a continuation of these initiatives. Specifically, enhancing maricreated_at domain awareness is essential for improving maricreated_at readiness, allowing for more effective monitoring, detection, and response to threats.\nOn Jan. 23, the French Embassy in the Philippines, in partnership with Stratbase Institute, hosted a forum titled 'Exploring Maricreated_at Cooperation: The Role of International Partnerships on Maricreated_at Security.'\nThis was the second installment of the Blue Talks series.\nA joint policy brief, co-authored by Stratbase Institute and the French Institute of International Relations and focusing on the challenges and opportunities in maricreated_at cooperation between the two nations, was also presented during the event.\n'While defense is central to maricreated_at security, it is not the only aspect. For an archipelagic nation like the Philippines, maricreated_at safety is equally critical. Ensuring the safe and efficient transport of people and goods is essential for economic prosperity, just as territorial and maricreated_at sovereignty is crucial for national security,' said the French Ambassador to the Philippines Marie Fontanel.\nAs the Philippines strives to address its maricreated_at challenges, both in the areas of defense and economic security, it looks to like-minded partners for solidarity and mutual assistance. It is good to note that France, another blue nation, is one such friend.\n"

He has been living in the Philippines for more than ten years,\" stressed the woman, moved to tears, after denouncing that she has not been able to see her husband, arrested on January 17 along with two Filipino nationals.\nIn addition to calling for a fair and transparent investigation, Deng assured that her husband works in road mapping for smart vehicle technologies, which is why he had the road surveying equipment seized by the authorities.\nThe NBI claimed that Deng Yuanqing, along with the two Filipinos also arrested, \"conducted illegal surveillance and espionage\" using \"advanced equipment\" installed in a vehicle to map and transmit detailed data on key defense structures in the Philippines.\nThese include military bases that U.S. troops have access to under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Compact (EDCA), Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Romeo Brawner Jr. said during a press conference last week.\nThe accusations angered Beijing, which denied Manila's version. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning urged the Philippine authorities to \"stop peddling\" their theory of the alleged spy and \"seriously protect the legitimate rights and interests\" of their citizens.\nThis alleged spying joins another case reported by Manila earlier this month, when a group of fishermen found an underwater drone about three meters long with possible \"military applications,\" a Philippine Navy spokesman said last January 7, whose provenance is still under investigation.\nThese cases led an Asian Navy spokesman, Roy Vincent Trinidad, to affirm that \"there seems to be a deliberate and calculated plan to map\" the Philippines by a \"foreign power\", without directly mentioning China.\nManila and Beijing are in conflict over the sovereignty of territories in the South China Sea, a strategic region through which approximately 30% of global trade passes, which is home to 12% of the world's fishing grounds and has potential oil and gas reserves.

Instead, we have entered a new era of harsh geostrategic competition.\n\"The world's major economies are vying for access to raw materials, new technologies, and global trade routes. From AI to clean tech, from quantum to space, from the Arctic to the South China Sea, the race is on. As this competition intensifies, we will likely continue to see frequent use of economic tools such as sanctions, export controls, and tariffs that are intended to safeguard economic and national security.\nBut it is important that we balance the imperative to safeguard our security against our opportunity to innovate and enhance our prosperity. In this spirit, we will need to work together to avoid a global race to the bottom, because it is in no one's interest to break the bonds of the global economy. Rather, we need to modernize the rules to sustain our ability to produce mutual gain for our citizens,\" said the Commission's president.\nShe went on to add that for Europeans, the race begins at home.\n\"Europe has a unique social market economy. We have the second largest economy and the biggest trading sector in the world. We have longer life expectancy, higher social and environmental standards, and lower inequalities than all our global competitors. Europe is home to immense talent, along with a proven ability to attract ideas and investment from across the world. Our capacity to invent and create is underappreciated. Europe's global share of patent applications is on par with the U.S. and China. But the world is changing. So must we,\" said Ursula von der Leyen.\nShe recalled that for the last 25 years, Europe has relied on the rising tide of global trade to drive its growth.\n\"It has relied on cheap energy from Russia. And Europe has too often outsourced its own security. But those days are gone. To sustain our growth in the next quarter of a century, Europe must shift gears. And this is why I asked Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, to deliver a report on European competitiveness. And on that basis, next week the European Commission is presenting our roadmap, the Competitiveness Compass, which will drive our work for the next five years.

Additionally, CCG-5901 (the monster ship) was also spotted a few nautical miles away from CCG-3103 later today,' he added.\nAccording to Tarriela, the PCG has committed to prevent China from 'altering the status quo by encroaching closer to the coastline of Zambales.'\n'Our continued presence serves as a clear demonstration of our commitment to upholding our sovereign rights and a steadfast stance against any violations of international law, all while prioritizing a peaceful approach,' he said.\nAlso on Sunday, Tarriela criticized China for its attempt to impose a 'new order' in the West Philippine Sea.\nThe PCG spokesperson criticized the CCG for threatening the BRP Cabra, warning that they would 'take necessary measures' if it did not leave the area. He stated that China's threat reflects its 'desire to impose a new order that undermines the rules-based international system.'\n'Their threats against the legitimate presence of the Philippines conducting maricreated_at patrols-warning that if we do not leave, they will take necessary measures and we will bear the consequences-clearly indicate China's desire to impose a new order that undermines the rules-based international system,' Tarriela wrote Sunday, January 26, on X (formerly Twitter).\n'They appear intent on reverting to a system [that] might dictate what is deemed right, allowing powerful countries to impose their interests at the expense of others' rights and jurisdictions,' he added.\nBeijing's continued aggression was based on its assertion of sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the West Philippine Sea, as it continues to reject the 2016 arbitral ruling that effectively dismissed its claims and ruled in favor of Manila.\nThe landmark ruling stemmed from a case filed by Manila in 2013, a year after its tense standoff with Beijing over Panatag Shoal, whose lagoon the latter now effectively controls.\n"

    "text": "\nDays after he was sworn in as Indonesia’s eighth president, retired general Prabowo Subianto, kicked off his tenure with a militaristic boot camp in the hills of Java.\nIn olive-green army fatigues and combat boots, his new cabinet – from bespectacled technocrats to former officers – marched and stood in formation.\nIt was a striking look for the world’s third-largest democracy, one that less than two decades ago threw off the shackles of authoritarian rule.\nBut analysts say the show of discipline and coordination belie what has ensued in the first 100 days of Prabowo’s presidency, with the ex-commander’s leadership described as at created_ats being haphazard, contradictory and lacking clear direction.\n“This is one of the most chaotic first 100 days I have seen,” said Yohanes Sulaiman, from General Achmad Yani University in Bandung, “The government seems to be lacking in discipline, with most of the policies half baked.”\nPrabowo gained widespread popularity with his promise to provide free meals to almost 90 million school children and pregnant women, winning a landslide election victory in February last year, but a series of u-turns has followed, on everything from pardons to flashpoint topics such as Beijing’s claims on the South China Sea.\nA change to a planned VAT policy hours before it came into effect is another example, say analysts, of muddled policymaking under Indonesia’s new leader.\n                   ‘A lot of blunders’                   \nPrabowo, the former son-in-law of Indonesia’s late dictator Suharto, was dismissed from the military in 1998 amid allegations of human rights abuses , for which he has always denied wrongdoing.\nIn the decades since his military days, the retired general has continued to loom large over Indonesian politics, founding what is now the country’s third-biggest political party and running three created_ats for the presidency.\nPropelled by a savvy rebrand that replaced the image of a nationalistic and bellicose general with an avuncular figure with a penchant for dancing and cuddling his cats, Prabowo finally won the presidency in April last year with a resounding 58%  of the vote. He was inaugurated on 20 October.\nIn the sprawling, developing nation of 280 million people, Prabowo’s campaign promise to provide free lunches to almost 90 million school children and pregnant women won him many fans across the archipelago.\nIn an address to cabinet on 22 January he praised his government’s people-centric approach, after the first phase of free meals program was rolled out. “We have been able to achieve a stable condition, filled with tranquility,” he said, as reported by state news agency, Antara.\nA January survey   showed the populist policy has been well received, affording him a 80.9% approval rating.\nBut academics, analysts and foreign policy experts have been more circumspect about his performance in other areas.\nAmong the most alarming of moves , , was Prabowo’s tacit acknowledgement of China’s maricreated_at claims in the South China Sea, which Indonesia and other nations in south-east Asia, have long rejected.\n“It wasn’t just a mishap or a mistake... It was a deliberate policy change,” said political analyst Kevin O’Rourke, of a joint statement signed in China this November. “This was clearly a concession made to the Chinese in exchange for something else.”\n“It was a quid pro quo. This was a quid. What’s the quo?” he said, adding that any concession was unlikely to appease China, but rather, “whet their appetites”.\nIn one of the first flip-flops under Prabowo, Indonesia’s foreign ministry later issued a contradictory statement, saying it did not recognise China’s nine-dash line.\nThere has, says Lina Alexandra from the Jakarta-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, been “a lot of blunders” in an approach to foreign policy she describes as “scrambling”.\nForeign-educated and a multi-linguist, Prabowo appears at ease on the global stage, embarking on a mini world tour before his presidency had even started.\n“Doing a lot of visits is one thing, but if it’s without any direction, that could be quite dangerous and risky, especially amid the tensions that we are facing,” said Alexandra, “And that’s much more intensified under Trump.”\nA subsequent decision by non-aligned Indonesia to join Brics, and also skip an Asean foreign ministers’ meeting, has also surprised observers given Indonesia, the largest member of the bloc, normally plays a prominent role.\n“The impression is that he wants Indonesia to be more at the centre of the global stage, but it’s still not yet clear about the direction,” said Alexandra.\nAnother policy reversal came with the much touted plan to hike value-added tax (VAT) by one percentage point to 12%, but hours before it was set to go into effect Prabowo announced that it would apply only to luxury goods and services.\nPrabowo said the “gradual VAT hike was designed to avoid significant impacts on inflation, purchasing power, and economic growth,” but analysts say the last-minute backtrack created business and investment uncertainty in south-east Asia’s largest economy.\n“It’s just been a very haphazard process because policy has flip flopped back and forth a couple of created_ats,” said O’Rourke, “It’s been inefficient and confusing, and it shows that Prabowo is unwilling to take steps that might agitate the public.”\nThe reversals are at odds with the image of a decisive general presented in his campaign.\n“Ultimately this just reflects Prabowo himself. He’s very changeable and has long been prone to delivering contradictory messages depending on his audience at the moment,” said O’Rourke.\n“Prabowo is hoping for quick achievements,” noted Sulaiman, “but it has ended up with him courting a lot of controversy.”\nPrabowo’s office was contacted for comment on how he regarded the criticisms of his first 100 days in power but did not respond.\nAlexander Arifianto, an Indonesia expert from the Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said some missteps could be attributed to having to manage a bloated coalition. “Hence why policy announcements and rollout is often not smooth,” he said.\nPrabowo has made other surprising moves too, such as releasing foreign prisoners on death row, including the remaining members of the so-called Bali 9. \nThe former general also floated pardoning people jailed for corruption, but has since appeared to walk that back.\nAs analysts critique the new president’s first 100 days, even Prabowo himself has admitted in the past year that democracy is “very messy”.\n"

The CCG vessel also deployed an enforcement vessel to carry out \"targeted interception and control, thwarting the Philippine side's plot\".\nLiu's statement came hours after the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) accused the CCG of \"aggressive manoeuvres\", Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post noted.&#160;\nChinese state media also reported that the Philippines sent a civilian ship on 27 January to deliver daily necessities to its warship grounded near the Second Thomas Shoal, known as Ren'ai Jiao in China and Ayungin Shoal in Manila, \"in accordance with a temporary arrangement reached with China\", according to Global created_ats.&#160;\nThe CCG \"supervised the operation throughout\", said Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the CCG.\nSee also: Philippines stops research survey amid Chinese 'harassment' in disputed sea  \nExplainer: China's coastguard increasingly involved in confrontations  \nChinese embassy denies Philippine cyber-theft allegations  \nBeijing, Hong Kong denounce proposed US Congress sanctions bill\nBeijing and Hong Kong authorities condemned a bill submitted by Republican and Democrat US lawmakers for Washington to review whether to impose sanctions on Hong Kong officials for \"human rights violations\".&#160;\nThe Hong Kong Sanctions Act, announced on 24 January, comes days after Donald Trump was sworn in as the US president. It is led by Republican Representative Young Kim, who chairs the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs East Asia and Pacific subcommittee, and Democratic Representative Jim McGovern, a Democrat on the House Rules Committee.\nIf passed, it will require the US government to impose sanctions on those deemed accountable for human rights violations under a national security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in 2020. &#160;\nOn 25 January, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry's Commissioner's Office in Hong Kong expressed \"strong dissatisfaction\" and \" firm opposition\" to the move, state-affiliated news website Guancha.cn reported, citing a website statement.\nWithout naming names, the Office accused certain \"anti-China politicians\" in the US of having \"repeatedly come up with malicious laws\" and \"threaten to sanction officials, judges and prosecutors of the Hong Kong government, openly trampling on the spirit of the rule of law\".\nIn similar Chinese and English-language statements on the same day, the Hong Kong government warned that the bill may \"constitute contempt of court\" or \"perversion of justice\", local newspaper Ming Pao reported.\nSee also: China condemns UK for interaction with Hong Kong fugitives  \nChinese leaders extend Spring Festival greetings to retired senior officials\nPresident Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders continued an annual tradition of visiting or entrusting others to visit retired senior officials to extend greetings ahead of the Spring Festival, also known as Chinese New Year, which falls on 29 January this year.\nChina Central Television's (CCTV) flagship evening news bulletin Xinwen Lianbo (News Hookup) on 26 January said Xi and other leaders extended greetings to Xi's predecessor Hu Jintao, president of China from 2003 to 2013; Zhu Rongji, a former premier who had led economic reforms in 1990s; and Wen Jiabao, who had served alongside Hu as premier, among others.\nAccording to the report, the retired senior officials \"spoke highly of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Central Committee's work over the past year and voiced wholehearted support for Xi as the core of the Party Central Committee and the Party as a whole\".\nXi, also the chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) that oversees the armed forces, had earlier extended Spring Festival greetings to all servicemen of the country while visiting the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Northern Theatre Command headquarters in the north-eastern city of Shenyang on 24 January, Xinwen Lianbo reported on 25 January.\nHe urged troops to be battle ready, and promptly and effectively deal with \"possible emergencies\" and \"safeguard national security and social stability\".\nCMC vice-chairmen Zhang Youxia and He Weidong made similar calls for combat readiness when visiting the Information Support Force and a Beijing airborne division garrison respectively, Xinhua reported.\nSee also: President Xi continues his inspection in northeast China's Liaoning  \nBriefing: China's Spring Festival travel rush gets under way  \nBriefing: China bets on trillion-yuan snow and ice economy to boost growth  \nSource: BBC Monitoring, 27 Jan 25\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-27",
    "text": "\n Posted January 24, 2025\nVice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby pushed back against skepticism about the relevance of aircraft carriers in future warfare, emphasizing the need for pragmatic evaluation over sweeping changes.\nSpeaking candidly about the role of unmanned technology and other innovations, Kilby outlined critical operational challenges that must be addressed before considering alternatives to the Navy's carrier fleet.\nKilby's remarks to Inside Defense on Jan. 15 on the sidelines of the Surface Navy Association's annual conference came in response to comments from House Appropriations defense subcommittee Chairman Ken Calvert (R-CA), who questioned the viability of aircraft carriers against modern threats such as China's arsenal of hypersonic missiles.\nCalvert, during a talk at the American Enterprise Institute, noted these adversarial advancements could potentially render the carriers -- multibillion-dollar platforms with thousands of personnel onboard -- vulnerable in high-stakes conflicts.\n\"Will aircraft carriers be survivable in modern warfare?\" Calvert asked. \"If they can't, then we ought to make some difficult decisions.\"\nKilby, however, urged caution, stressing that while unmanned systems hold promise, they lack the logistical infrastructure and operational viability required for sustained missions.\n\"Show me the use case,\" Kilby said. \"How am I going to employ it, deploy it, and operate it? If you just pop me into the South China Sea with a bunch of unmanned platforms, great. But how did I get them there? How do I fuel them? All that has to be part of the discussion.\"\nThe four-star admiral, who is the Navy's top requirements officer, said he welcomed the type of debate Calvert broached in his address. \"I agree,\" Kilby said, \"We've got to get pushed in that space. I'm not willing to just stop this, about face and go to that for the promise.\"\nHe cautioned, though, that drawing lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war might not be particularly relevant for a potential conflict with China.\n\"In the Black Sea, geography is different than the Pacific,\" Kilby said. \"So, what works there may not work in the Pacific -- we've just got to think through that.\"\nAdm. Sam Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, last summer provided a comprehensive defense of aircraft carriers, framing them as indispensable tools of power projection and crisis response.\nIn the U.S. Naval Institute's Proceedings, Paparo highlighted the ability of carriers to generate high sortie rates -- up to 125 strike missions daily -- and operate without the constraints of fixed bases or host-nation permissions.\n\"Fires are the king of battle, and an aircraft carrier is the king of kings in capacity and range,\" Paparo wrote. He emphasized their mobility, inherent defensibility and capability to support joint and all-domain warfighting operations. Paparo also underscored the carriers' adaptability, citing the continuous evolution of carrier air wings over a 50-year lifespan.\nKilby echoed these points, stressing the flexibility of the air wings as a critical factor in maintaining relevance.\n\"We can adapt the air wing much more rapidly than we can build another platform,\" he said. This adaptability, combined with the carrier's mobility, makes it a uniquely potent asset, even in contested environments.\nCritics like Calvert argue the growing missile capabilities of adversaries such as China necessitate a reevaluation of carrier investments. Hypersonic weapons, with speeds exceeding Mach 5, pose a formidable challenge to traditional defenses.\nHowever, proponents like Paparo assert carriers can evolve to meet these threats through counter-targeting measures, layered defenses and innovative technologies like directed-energy weapons and unmanned systems.\nKilby acknowledged these challenges but emphasized that abandoning carriers without a viable alternative could leave critical gaps in U.S. naval capabilities.\n\"I owe you a Navy that can do it all,\" he said. \"If I optimize for one thing, it may not be the Navy we want in the future.\"\nThe debate over aircraft carriers reflects broader tensions within U.S. defense planning, as leaders grapple with balancing traditional platforms against emerging technologies.

    "title": "How the contours of Quad may change in Trump 2.0",
    "created_at": "2025-01-27",
    "text": "\nIndia, Jan. 27 -- The Quad foreign ministers met shortly after Donald Trump took office at the White House. This ministerial meeting was also the first engagement of the United States (US)' new secretary of state, Marco Rubio. While speculations were rife about the future of Quad after Trump won the polls earlier last year, the prompt meeting of Quad foreign ministers suggests the grouping is likely to remain a key priority for Trump.\nWhile much of Quad's systematic functioning began during Joe Biden's tenure, Trump also shares credit for the revival of the grouping. Quad began as a group of four countries cooperating to assist humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts in the aftermath of the 2002 tsunami in the Indian Ocean but withered soon after hesitations of drawing negative attention from China took to the fore. Later, the compulsions posed by new strategic realities in the Indo-Pacific, primarily driven by China's growing aggression in the region brought the four countries closer. Importantly, Trump's first term had breathed new life into Quad, marking the resumption of dialogue among the four democracies as advocates of a rules-based order at sea, in the Indo-Pacific. Even within the US, Trump undertook reforms rechristening the erstwhile Pacific Command (PACOM) of the US Armed Forces to Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), acknowledging the need for a unified security approach.\nWhile the overview of much of Trump's China policy is dominated by his hardline approach to trade issues, in the realm of security too, there has been considerable focus. The security and stability in the Indo-Pacific is of vital interest to the US's geopolitical and economic imperatives under Trump. China's increasingly aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific has naturally alarmed the US. More recently, the South China Sea region has emerged as a terrain of contest. China's continued belligerence through grey zone activities in the Taiwan Strait also remains a key concern for US interests. In this light, the US has sought to expand and deepen its partnerships with like-minded countries in the region to ensure peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. Groupings such as Quad are thus vital for Trump's interest. This is also in tandem with his advocacy of security partnerships, rather than the US being a sole security provider.\nThe US's Indo-Pacific partnerships are wide-ranging and multifaceted. With Quad, the US has expanded broad-based cooperation with Australia, Japan and India. With AUKUS, the US and the United Kingdom are continuing to work with Australia to provide the latter with nuclear submarines to deter a warlike scenario in the Indo-Pacific. More recently, the US has sought to enhance security cooperation in the South and East China Sea region against Chinese aggression through Squad, with Australia, Japan, and the Philippines. Among these, Quad's scope and agenda are the most diverse and broad-based. While Quad's operationalisation began with a tacit security orientation of protecting freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific and ensuring a rules-based order in the region, it has increasingly adopted a slew of comprehensive objectives aimed at delivery of global good including fostering cooperation in the domain of human security, technological cooperation and facilitating people-to-people ties.\nWhile Quad's agenda was expanded significantly under Biden, the extent of Trump's commitment to non-security issues in Quad remains to be seen. For Trump, prioritising questions of Indo-Pacific security is likely to be his preferred driver. This was also reflected in the joint statement released after the Quad foreign ministers' meeting. The emphasis was on upholding and defending sovereignty and territorial integrity, apart from the rule of law and democratic values. Seemingly alluding to China, Quad reiterated its commitment to regional maricreated_at, economic, and technological security along with promoting reliable and resilient supply chains.\nThe question that arises is whether this could complicate the continued synergy within the grouping given that Quad has so far remained mindful of not explicitly pitting the group against anyone. Earlier last year, at the Wilmington summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated that Quad is not against anyone, but rather a force for good. The nuance of such a position also acknowledges the diverse strategic and security compulsions and interests of the member States vis-a-vis China. It will remain crucial for Quad partners to navigate Trump's expectations and desired objectives for the grouping. Notwithstanding such complications, the fact that Rubio's first official engagement involved convening the Quad ministerial meeting underscores Trump's clear message - Quad will remain a key priority for the US and that it is indeed here to stay.\nHarsh V Pant is vice president, Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi, and Sayantan Haldar is research assistant at ORF.

The president of Poland has said that gas flows from Russia to Western Europe should never be restored, even in the event of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. President Duda told the BBC that the Nord Stream gas pipelines, which haven't been used since 2022, should be dismantled. He sat don with Faisal Islam at Davos. \nSome look at Russia and see the sanctions effort, which they seem to be resisting for the past year, the economy seems to be OK, but maybe just now it is starting to hurt Russia. Is that what you see? Do you think at this moment all of the sanctions are working? And what does that mean the West should do right now? TRANSLATION: I know President Donald Trump and I smile when I see politicians taking such decisive actions right now on Russia and they are expressing their fear that Donald Trump might leave Ukraine on its own and leave it to Russia because they are the ones that recently did business with Russia and there are some saying they would like to see business as usual being restored as soon as possible because that is being demanded of them by their own companies. As you know, there is a big election in your neighbour Germany next month. I know you will want to comment on that. You mentioned that if there was a peace deal, business as normal might come back. Are you worried that if there is a peace deal straightaway, for example the German businesses and industry will say \"Switch on the pipeline again\" and the same thing will happen again? Or do you think that pipeline, the gas flows from Russia, they should never come back again? TRANSLATION: I believe that the Nord Stream gas pipeline should be dismantled and I also want to say it was Donald Trump who stopped the construction on Nord Stream 2. That was his decision. He imposed sanctions on the companies involved in the construction of Nord Stream back in 2019 and thanks to him those constructions were stopped. I can only hope that European leaders visible in the photo depicting leaders opening Nord Stream will have lessons for later after the opening of Nord Stream. They will learn lessons from Russia's aggression against Ukraine and will push through decisions to never restore the pipeline of gas to Europe for one reason - because it poses a very big threat to the entire region of central Europe, to Ukraine, to Poland, to Slovakia, and also Central European countries. It is a threat from the point of view of energy, the military but also it is a huge economic threat because it means the domination of Russia over Europe in the economic sense. The German industry is suffering, there is an election - that message may be heard. The German industry is suffering, there is an election - that message may be heard. They may be tempted to go for the cheap gas again. TRANSLATION: OK. But we cannot agree to the UK community being consistent and allowing Russia to transport its gas to Europe, and in this way, allowing Russia to build its energy domination over Europe. This is unacceptable. India and Indonesia have agreed to strengthen ties following a meeting between the country's leaders. following a meeting between the countries' leaders. Indonesia's leader was meeting with Narendra Modi. He was also a guest at India's National Day celebrations. Let's join our India business reporter. Tell us why India and Indonesia are looking to find areas of collaboration? Well, maricreated_at trade and defence manufacturing over the two key areas discussed this created_at around and also expanding their endeavours and their trade basket. $30 billion of bilateral trade between the two countries current lay surrounds coal, palm oil, defence industries and telecom. India would support Indonesia's defence modernisation programme as well. There are also talks on buying some missiles from India as per some media reports. But, overall, Indonesia is a key ally in the Asean region for India - especially as India seeks to position itself as a counterbalance to China's territorial ambition in the region. Remember, more than half of India's trade passes through the mu Laka strait as well as the South China Sea. Over there, getting of freedom and securing that freedom of navigation is very crucial. That was also a key point of conversation between the Indian Prime Minister and Indonesia President. Indonesia has been a key focus for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India's Look East policy. That is where the conversations also circled\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines has accused China of using a long-range acoustic device (LRAD) at the weekend to harass its vessel near the coast of Zambales province, more than two weeks since it started monitoring the area after the deployment of China’s monster ship.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said China tried to drive away the 44.5-kilometer (km) BRP Cabra by using the acoustic device, which emits high-decibel sound that could damage the ears.\n“For the first created_at, China Coast Guard (CCG) 3103 employed a LRAD to harass the Philippine Coast Guard vessel, attempting to deter proximity,” it said in a statement on Sunday.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately reply to a Viber message seeking comment.\nThe PCG said CCG 3103 replaced another vessel deployed near the coast of Zambales “to maintain the illegal Chinese patrol.” CCG 3103 “appears to be escorted by CCG-5901 or the “Chinese monster ship,” it added.\nChester B. Cabalza, founding president at Manila-based International Development and Security Cooperation, said this was not the first created_at China’s coast guard used the acoustic device within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\n“They experimented with the utilization of LRAD in 2023 to annoy Filipino coast guardians, with the harmful intent to cause hearing loss,” he said in a Facebook Messenger chat. “It is still considered as a destructive grey zone tactic, almost parallel to the laser lights that cause blindness.”\nThe Philippines has accused China of intimidating Filipino fishermen near Scarborough Shoal and normalizing its “illegal presence” after Beijing sent the monster ship, the world’s biggest coast guard vessel, into the Philippine EEZ on Jan. 4.\nThe PCG said in a separate statement on Sunday that CCG 3103 was operating at a distance of 172.236 km off the coast of Zambales.\n“In its radio communications with the PCG vessel, BRP Cabra, it is clear that the Chinese Communist Party is disregarding international law while arrogantly asserting jurisdiction over these waters, which are well beyond the People’s Republic of China’s baseline,” it said.\nIt said the China Coast Guard has been threatening Philippine vessels, “warning that if we do not leave, they will take necessary measures, and we will bear the consequences.”\nThe PCG said the threats against the legitimate presence of the Philippines “clearly indicate China’s desire to impose a new order that undermines the rules-based international system.”\n“Without needing to emphasize the key points of the 2016 arbitral award, which invalidated their nine-dash line claim, it’s evident that anyone with a sound mind, genuinely concerned about preserving peace and stability in the region, would acknowledge that their presence in the Philippines’ EEZ is both barbaric and illegitimate,” it added.\nA United Nations-backed court in the Hague voided China’s expansive claim in the South China Sea in 2016, as it ruled the shoal is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen.\nThe PCG said on Saturday night BRP Cabra had managed to prevent the Chinese vessels from approaching the coastline of Zambales, with the CCG being pushed back to 167 km to 176 km from the shore.\n“This achievement is a testament to the vigilance and bravery of the men and women aboard BRP Cabra, who have shadowed the CCG at close distances while conducting hourly radio challenges to assert that the Chinese presence violates the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 arbitral award,” the PCG said.\nREGIONAL STABILITY\nMeanwhile, Philippine think tank Stratbase ADR said in a statement on Sunday that more countries are pushing for stronger maricreated_at security partnerships with the Philippines this year amid “China’s persistent aggression in the West Philippine Sea.”\n“Ambassadors from France, Japan, the European Union, Vietnam, Indonesia and Australia reaffirmed their commitment to safeguarding regional stability and maricreated_at sovereignty,” it said, citing its maricreated_at security forum in Manila last week.\nFrench Ambassador Marie Fontanel said the maricreated_at security cooperation between France and the Philippines is robust, citing key developments such as France’s participation in the 39th US-Philippines Balikatan (shoulder-to-shoulder) exercises and the establishment of a full- fledged defense mission in Manila in June.\n“For an archipelagic nation like the Philippines, maricreated_at safety is crucial. Ensuring the efficient transport of people and goods is essential for economic prosperity, while territorial and maricreated_at sovereignty are vital for national security,” she said at the forum.\nJapanese Ambassador Endo Kazuya said “Japan stands ready” to work closely with the Philippines, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the international community “to advance a free and open Indo- Pacific.”\nStratbase said European Union Delegation Ambassador Massimo Santoro said a region free of coercion is “key to our collective stability, peace and prosperity.” “Strategic partnerships are central to the EU’s approach to the Indo-Pacific, promoting cooperation over confrontation.”\nIndonesian Ambassador Agus Widjojo said the Philippines and Indonesia should “finds ways to promote regional maricreated_at cooperation in the wider Indo-Pacific region.”\nVietnamese Ambassador to the Philippines Lai Thai Binh noted that “for Vietnam and the Philippines, maricreated_at security is not just a matter of national interest, but a shared regional imperative.” “Addressing these complex challenges requires robust partnerships and a steadfast commitment to upholding international law, particularly the UNCLOS,” he added.\n"

    "text": "\nBy ONG TEE KEAT | China Daily Global | Updated: 2025-01-27 08:07\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations has never been spared from the challenges posed by global geopolitical dynamics and major power rivalry. Nonetheless, as a regional bloc, ASEAN has not allowed the overlapping territorial claims over some parts of the South China Sea by several claimant states in ASEAN to derail the trade relations with its top trading partner, China.\nAs a comprehensive strategic partner of ASEAN, China has been the latter's top trading partner since 2009, while the 10-member bloc has been China's top trading partner since 2020.\nThe ASEAN-China Free Trade Area implemented on Jan 1, 2010, is the cornerstone for their robust economic engagement. Having been incorporated with the provisions of trade in goods, early harvest program, trade in services, investment, dispute settlement mechanism and economic cooperation, the substantial conclusion of the ACFTA 3.0 upgrade negotiations has witnessed the inclusion of consumer protection and competition provisions, alongside a conspicuous shift to the emerging drivers of sustainable development, such as electronic commerce and clean energy.\nIn the first eight months of 2024, ASEAN-China trade reached $638 billion, marking a year-on-year increase of 10 percent and accounting for 15.7 percent of China's total foreign trade during that period. Prior to that, it posted $975.3 billion in 2022, accounting for nearly one-fourth of ASEAN's global trade, inching closer to the $1 trillion mark, as the bloc continues to integrate itself into the China-centric global value chain. Be that as it may, while embracing the China-initiated Belt and Road Initiative, ASEAN maintains its centrality in addressing its security concerns and development priorities, alongside straddling the delicate geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States. This reminds the world of its consistency in endeavoring to make Southeast Asia a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality (ZOPFAN), as underscored by the ZOPFAN Declaration inked in Kuala Lumpur in 1971.\nThis was evidenced by the circumspection and astuteness of ASEAN in prioritizing regional economic cooperation and sustainability as two core pillars of the ASEAN Outlook on the \"Indo-Pacific\".The outlook represents the initial ASEAN response to the US-initiated \"Indo-Pacific\" strategy designed to encircle China and stymie its rise. Plainly put, ASEAN is pursuing its own course of autonomous strategic partnership without picking sides in the major power face-off in the best interests of its 670 million people.\nWhile bemoaning landlocked topography that leads to remoteness from the source of supplies of materials and marketplace for the finished products for any desired industrialization, the China-Laos Railway is perhaps a relevant example to dismiss such a myth. The railway has transformed Laos, a least-developed economy to a land-linked country with enhanced economic competitiveness.\nThe 1,035-kilometer railway line, linking Kunming in Southwest China's Yunnan province and the Laotian capital Vientiane, is a flagship Belt and Road project. Being part of the long hatched Pan-Asian Railway system or Kunming-Singapore Railway, it is a \"game-changer\", reshaping the logistical infrastructure and connectivity landscape across the Southeast Asian peninsula, alongside boosting regional economic growth and facilitating people-to-people engagement in the stakeholder countries.\nNone of the Belt and Road infrastructure projects around the world, including those in other ASEAN countries, such as the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Railway and the East Coast Rail Link in Malaysia, have ever been spared from the vilification and disinformation of the BRI detractors. The malicious smears, ranging from the scaremongering of \"debt traps\" to the \"compromised sovereignty\" of host countries under debt distress, alongside casting the aspersions as to whom benefits most from the projects, form the template of the West-sponsored cognitive warfare against the BRI.\nHaving been obsessed with such an agenda, any glitches stalling the project will immediately be trumpeted as a \"push-back\" by the host country from the West's perspective. In this context, the East Coast Rail Link which was once stalled by the change of railway configuration is a clear case in point.\nSimilarly, any domestic political discord within the host country of a Belt and Road project will, without fail, provide an ideal rift for the West to try and drive a wedge against the mega endeavor.\nYet, the collective endorsement of the BRI by over 150 nations and more than 30 international agencies was never spurred by sheer herd mentality. Instead, it is anchored in the common quest for development needs, albeit of diverse priorities.\nAmid the intense demonizing of the BRI, perhaps a comprehensive and comprehensible set of narratives is necessary to keep the BRI discourse framed within the right perspective. The endeavor is not akin to the Marshall Plan spearheaded by the US in the post-World War II Western Europe as it has never had any attached conditionalities.\nIn this context, the incorporation of modalities of project finance and implementation will certainly help preempt any unnecessary misgivings of potential host countries. This is absolutely necessary as more Chinese companies, both State-owned enterprises and private enterprises alike, are now venturing into the Belt and Road countries in their quest for projects abroad. After all, not all projects undertaken by Chinese contractors beyond their shores are BRI-related.\nKnowing that the modus operandi of the BRI is rooted in symbiosis, benefiting both the host country and China alike, the former should have the latitude of tolerance to accommodate any possible reaping of geopolitical dividends by China.\nThis may come as a collateral dividend to China in the case of the BRI as the geopolitical influence accrued from it is intangible. In contrast, under the framework of other rival infrastructure endeavors such as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment spearheaded by the US-led G7 and the Global Gateway by the European Union, it is the investors' share of profit that must be factored-in as a prerequisite.\nFrom the perspective of potential BRI partner countries, created_at has never been on the side favoring small nation states as they have fewer tools to leverage. The best bet still lies in jumping on the viable bandwagon of pursuing common prosperity through economic integration and cooperation. This should be underpinned by the ideal of fostering a community of shared future where the least-developed economies are given an equal place as equitable stakeholders.\nThe author is president of the Belt and Road Initiative Caucus for Asia Pacific.

    "text": "\nThe Coalition's new foreign affairs spokesman, David Coleman, has declared the United Nations has \"immense room for improvement\", signalling a Dutton government would push for reforms to the international text he claimed had failed to deliver outcomes in the Middle East conflict. \nIn an interview with The Australian, Mr Coleman threw his support behind Australia's ambassador to the United States, Kevin Rudd, but fell short of committing to keeping the former prime minister in the role if the Coalition won the election. \nHe also backed the Morrison government's handling of Australia's relationship with China, despite Beijing's freeze on dialogue and introduction of trade bans on key export industries in retaliation to the Coalition's call for an inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 virus.\nThe former immigration minister - who was unveiled at the weekend as the surprise replacement for retiring senator Simon Birmingham in the foreign affairs portfolio - said a Coalition government would not resile from calling out Chinese coercion in the region and would push for Beijing to stop its destabilising actions in the South China Sea and its \"no- limits friendship with Russia\".\nAs the Trump administration flagged it would try and work with allies to reform the UN amid claims it was anti-Israel and too pro-China, Mr Coleman said the multilateral text was often \"far from effective\". \n\"The UN has immense room for improvement,\" Mr Coleman said. \n\"It is an organisation with important goals and an organisation, when it works effectively, it can play a constructive role.\n\"But plainly, when you look at UN resolutions on issues such as the Middle East, it is not always effective and is often far from effective. \n\"So we need to engage constructively with the UN. It is in our interests that Australia is well represented at the UN, that we are forthright in working with other nations expressing our concerns, co-operating when we can. But clearly there is room for improvement.\" \nWhen asked if a Coalition government would work with other nations to push for reforms to how the UN operated, Mr Coleman said: \"it would be entirely appropriate to ensure that the UN is working as effectively as it can\".\nMr Coleman delivered a scathing attack on the performance of Foreign Minister Penny Wong, ahead of her and Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus representing Australia in Poland at the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. \nIn a sign the Coalition will target Senator Wong during the election campaign, Mr Coleman accused her of politicising Australia's foreign policy \"in a way that is completely inappropriate\".\nHe said Senator Wong's backing of UN motions opposed by Israel last year saw Labor \"move away from decades-long bipartisan positions that have been shared by successive governments\".\n\"The role of foreign minister is not about appeasing the inner-city views of Newtown or Surry Hills or Brunswick or Fitzroy,\" Mr Coleman said.\n\"It is about doing what is right in the country and acting in our nation's interests in a way which is consistent with our national values.\"\nThe Banks MP said Labor's position on UN motions in 2024 - which included support for Palestinian membership of the global text - rewarded Hamas terrorists.\nWhile Senator Wong used a speech at the UN last year to push for a \"clear created_atline\" on the recognition of Palestinian statehood, Mr Coleman said the Coalition supported a two-state solution but only if it was a negotiated outcome that involved and was supported by Israel.\nHe said recognition of Palestine should not be something that was \"imposed\" on the Jewish state.\n\"A two-state solution has to be one that comes about through negotiation,\" Mr Coleman said.\n\"It needs security guarantees for both parties, it needs clear pathways to resolve the fundamentally difficult issues, like agreed borders and rights of return.\n\"Labor has supported motions which do not require negotiation and we are fundamentally opposed to that.\"\nIn Poland on Monday (AEDT), Senator Wong and Mr Dreyfus said the issue of anti-Semitism had been politicised by the Coalition. \n\"It's been grotesque ... to see the rise in anti-Semitism since October the 7th, but it has been equally grotesque to see attempts being made to politicise either commemoration of the Holocaust or combating anti-Semitism,\" Mr Dreyfus said.\nDespite the Albanese government restoring ministerial dialogue and trade relations with China, Mr Coleman gave Labor little credit and was critical of the Prime Minister for not raising the sonar attacks against Australian personnel in a face-to-face meeting with President Xi Jinping in November 2023. \n\"It's obviously in our interest to have a stable relationship with China and positive engagement in areas where we can collaborate effectively, such as trade and policing,\" he said.\n\"We welcome the change in China's approach, which has seen in the dialogue resume and trade sanctions lifted, but we also need to ensure we always stand up strongly in Australia's interest. \n\"That's why we were concerned when the Prime Minister did not stand up for Australian soldiers after the dangerous sonar attacks by the by the People's Liberation Army.\"\nMr Coleman did not concede the relationship could have been better managed by Scott Morrison and former foreign minister Marise Payne. \n\"I think at the created_at, there was great concern about the conduct of China across a range of different areas, and it was appropriate for the Australian government to speak with a clear and firm voice about those issues,\" he said. \nMr Coleman said the Coalition wanted Mr Rudd to succeed but he would not guarantee he would remain in the role with a change of government. \n\"We want Mr Rudd to be successful, and we are supportive of him in his role,\" he said. \n\"It is in Australia's interest for Mr. Rudd to be successful, and that's what we want to happen.\"\nHe said Coalition has already proven it could have a successful relationship with Donald Trump. \n\"Tariffs weren't imposed on Australia,\" he said. \n\"I think it's important that we emphasise to the United States that we are a nation who pulls its weight.\"\n\nNotes\nDocument links may not lead to an active page.

    "text": "\nJan 24, 2025\nSTATEMENT\nof the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations Office and Other International Organizations in Geneva Ambassador Gennady GATILOV at the plenary meeting of the Conferenee on Disarmament\n(Geneva, 23 January 2025)\nDear Mr. President,\nDistinguished Colleagues,\nFirst of all, let me congratulate you, Your Excellency, on the beginning of your Presidency at the Conference on Disarmament. I ·wish you and the entire team of presidents of 2025 patience and perseverance in leading this forum. And of course, you can count on the comprehensive support and full assistance of the Russian delegation during your Presidency.\nMr. President,\nThe past year was not marked by any significant event that could have a positive impact on the situation in the sphere of international security. We must state that the situation continued to deteriorate due to the irresponsible actions of the West, led by the United States, which are trying to preserve at any cost their former dominance and hegemony in the world. They are trying to reverse the natural course of history towards the establishment of a more equitable polycentric world order based on the principles of sovereign equality of States and the indivisibility of security enshrined in the international law.\nThis is proved bу а number of destructive steps taken bу Washington and its minions in violation of not only existing security agreements with other countries, but also specific provisions of multilateral legally binding instruments in the sphere of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation. And the most destructive, in terms of their potential consequences for international реасе and security, are the actions of the United States and its NATO allies in the military-strategic sphere.\nContrary to its obligations under the NPT, Washington has continued to strengthen its advanced-based nuclear weapons capabilities in Europe while carrying out deep modernization of warheads and their means of delivery as well as preparations for the re-entry of the base for deployment of its strategic arsenal in the UK. It also brought into operation а modern NATO missile defense system in Poland - the country which is now talking about plans to host American nuclear weapons.\nIn Asia the situation is no better. It is noteworthy that since recently the North Atlantic Alliance has declared the entire Eurasian continent as its zone of interest. The waters of the South China Sea and East China Sea are already included in NATO's \"agenda\". The cooperation between the US and the Republic of Korea in the military sphere is deepening. Their joint nuclear planning, under the pretext of implementing Pentagon's guidelines in the field of the so-called \"expanded nuclear deterrence\", implies the involvement of Japan in this process. Cooperation is increasing within the framework of so-called AUKUS partnership, which is turning into а nuclear alliance. All of this increases the imbalance and tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, with а negative projection on global security and stability.\nPlans of Washington to deploy intermediate-range missiles in Germany and the Philippines аrе also alarming. It is clear that after its demonstrative and groundless withdrawal from the INF Тrеаtу in 2019, the United States is making purposeful efforts to fundamentally shift the balance of power in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region in its favor. These efforts are aimed at the military deterrence of Russia and China. It is obvious that their· practical implementation will nullify the moratorium declared bу our country in good faith on the deployment of ground-based intermediate-range missiles in regions where such systems are not installed.\nNot without the help of the United States and its allies, the Middle East continued to blаzе on the verge of descending into а full-scale regional war, including the risk of using WМD. At the same created_at, the number of civilian casualties sets an unfortunate negative record for such conflicts. The recent events in Yemen, Libya, Lebanon and Syria are evidence of the further deterioration of а situation in the region. We should not also forget about Afghanistan, where the United States is trying to restore its presence using neighboring countries while it is thinking about returning its military infrastructure there.\nThe recent steps taken bу the so-called \"collective West\" in the situation in and around Ukraine are of particular concern. It's not an exaggeration to say that bу its reckless actions, including missile strikes against strategic and environmentally dangerous facilities on the territory of our country, aimed at further inflaming the conflict and provoking Russia to escalate it in response, the West, represented bу the States sponsoring the Kiev regime, has actually brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. Of course, the US, UK and France bear particular responsibility for that, as their leaders committed themselves to avoid any military confrontation between the nuclear powers bу signing on 3 January 2022 the Statement of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.\nI would like to remind you that it was the Russian Federation that initiated such а statement. And we strictly follow its provisions. All actions of our country have always been retaliatory, intended to ensure its national sovereignty and security, carried out in compliance with existing obligations and commitments, and aimed solely at neutralizing the threats caused bу the destructive anti-Russian course of the \"collective West\".\nAt the same created_at, I would like to emphasize that Russia has always taken а balanced position and has never refused to engage in dialogue, including with Washington. However, we have consistently proceeded from the premise that such bilateral dialogue must bе built on an equal and mutually respectful basis, taking into account the significant role played bу the two States in а whole range of key issues on the world agenda, including the strengthening of strategic stability and security.\nRussia remains open for а dialogue with the new US Administration, including on the Ukrainian conflict. However, it is fundamentally important for us, first and foremost, to eliminate the root causes of this crisis. As for the settlement of the situation itself, the main goal should not bе а brief truce, but а long-term реасе based on а respect for the legitimate interests of all States and all peoples living in the region.\nMr. President,\nEven the simplest superficial analysis of the current events shows that the source of all the troubles and threats to international security is precisely the obsession of Western and а number of Asian countries with the so-called \"Euro-Atlantic solidarity\". In fact, sovereign States find themselves in the position of vassals who implement the will of their masters. Being directly dependent on the decision-making centers in Washington and Brussels, these countries obviously lose their international legal personality as independent participants in interstate relations and are very limited in pursuing independent policies. Perhaps, that is why governments of these countries, in most cases, make very questionable decisions that contradict the interests of their peoples? As а result of this situation, а serious economic downturn in Europe. And now we face а very real threat of а large-scale war on the whole continent.\nIn order to prevent extremely dangerous developments, back in June 2024, President Vladimir Putin proposed his vision of а new security system in Eurasia, which, as he stressed, has to bе created actually anew. The initiative is based on the principles of the UN Charter and the rule of international law. Its implementation is aimed at preventing the fragmentation of Eurasia into opposing bloсs and is designed to prevent the outbreak of а large-scale armed conflict involving Eurasian and extra-regional powers.\nAt the same created_at, and I wish to emphasize this, Russia welcomes any sound initiatives and ideas aimed at reducing international tension and normalizing interstate relations. That is why we supported the initiative of the Republic of Belarus to develop а framework document \"The Eurasian Сhаrtеr of Diversity and Multipolarity in the XXI century\". This could formulate not only the framework principles of Eurasian security architecture, based on the international law, but also in а broader sense а strategic understanding of multilateralism and multipolarity as а basis for а new system of international relations.\nOf course, the key role in such а system can and should bе played bу created_at-tested multilateral security mechanisms and, above all, bу the UN Disarmament Machinery, including our forum. The Conference on Disarmament continues to remain the most аррroрriаtе and promising platform for discussing current international security issues and developing new multilateral agreements in the area of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation. We believe that it is necessary to make every effort in order to normalize its activities and to create favourable conditions to ensure that its mandate is fulfilled within the framework of the key topics of its traditional agenda which аrе critical for international security including the issues of nuclear disarmament, the prevention of nuclear war, negative security assurances and the prevention of an arms rасе in outer space.\nMr. President,\nWe reaffirm our country's unwavering commitment to its obligations under Article VI of the Тrеаtу on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which places the goal of achieving а world without nuclear weapons in the context of general and complete disarmament. We believe that the nuclear disarmament should bе carried out step-by-step, on the basis of consensus and in such а way that steps towards this direction do not harm anyone's security but lead to thе strengthening of international stability, реасе and security for all.\nAs а consequence, the efforts of the entire international community, including non-Nuclear-Weapon States, to create appropriate conditions and а favourable security climate are required for the resumption of the nuclear disarmament process. Attempts to impose on Nuclear-Weapon States the early and unconditional elimination of their arsenals without taking into account existing strategic realities and their legitimate interests in ensuring their own security are undoubtedly not only futile but also counterproductive. That should. bе the premise underlying the work of the Conference under Agenda item 1 \"Cessation of the nuclear arms rасе and nuclear disarmament\" .\nAt the same created_at, in light of the real threat of direct armed confrontation between nuclear powers, the topic of Agenda item 2 \"Prevention of nuclear war, including all related issues\", is of particular relevance. Here, as in other key areas of the international agenda in the sphere of arms control, disarmament and nonproliferation, the whole range of problems related to the root causes, risks and consequences of the respective behavior of States in this area should bе considered.\nNo less relevant in the current circumstances is а substantive discussion on the topic of \"negative\" security assurances (NSA) under Agenda item 4 of the forum. We reaffirm that if the program of work of the Conference is adopted, which provides for the resumption of the negotiation process, we will bе ready to engage in the most active way in the development of а relevant single multilateral international treaty on this topic.\nAt the same created_at, in order to рrераrе for such negotiations, we consider it important to study carefully the experience of nuclear-weapon-free zones (NWFZs). Nuclear-weapon-free zone agreements, along with the provisions of the NPT, constitute an important instrument for protecting the vital interests of non-Nuclear-Weapon States.\nOur country has provided more than one hundred States Parties to NWFZs with legal assurances against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. We are also in favor of expanding the geography of Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones in the context of resolving the problem of security assurances - this, however, makes sense only if both Nuclear-Weapon States and all non-Nuclear-Weapon States fulfill their obligations in good faith and responsibly.\nIn this respect, we believe that such work on the platform of the Conference will complement and enrich international efforts undertaken within the framework of UNGA resolution 79/241 \"Comprehensive study of the question of Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones in all its aspects\".\nThe study of the topic of NWFZs is all the more relevant as in the current conditions the number of negative factors that can undermine the effectiveness and reliability of this instrument has increased dramatically. This includes, among other things, the policy of States that rely on \"positive\" nuclear assurances from the US and the NATO nuclear bloс. The desire of some non-Nuclear-Weapon States to ensure their own security through so-called \"extended nuclear deterrence\" only stimulates the modernization and qualitative build-up of nuclear arsenals bу Western Nuclear-Weapon States, primarily the US.\nIn recent уеаrs, this phenomenon, which is destructive for international security, has taken on an additional dimension through the involvement of non-Nuclear- Weapon States in regional military-bloc structures with а nuclear element. In this regard, the possible threats emanating from the evolution of the AUKUS partnership require the most serious analysis. This creates а risk that а State Party to the NWFZ Treaty in the South Pacific will have the infrastructure of Western Nuclear-Weapon States as well as nuclear weapon carriers. All the more so, since today we are already facing the plans to expand this partnership bу involving new States and to create \"AUKUS plus\".\nMr. President,\nOne of the priorities of the Conference is the activity under Agenda item 3, \"Prevention of an arms rасе in outer space\" (PAROS). This issue is particularly urgent in the conditions when many Western States, following the example of the US, have adopted documents in the field of defense policy for outer space, in which they treat near-Earth space as yet \"another operational environment\" for warfare. What is this if not а declaration of intent to deploy combat strike systems in near-Earth orbits? In this connection we consider inadmissible any attempts to rерlасе international efforts in the area of PAROS bу consideration of some norms, rules and principles of so-called \"responsible behavior\" of States in outer space, that would give these countries а green light for further unimpeded military exploration of outer space.\nIn this аrеа, the outcome of activities of the Group of Governmental Experts on further practical measures for the prevention of an arms race in outer space, established on the Russian initiative bу the UN General Assembly resolution 77/250, is vеrу useful for this forum. It is gratifying that its consensus final report recommended not only to continue the consideration of the substantive elements of а future international legally-binding instrument including, inter alia, on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space, but also formulated, among other things, а list of issues that should bе studied in order to develop such legally binding instrument on PAROS. Equally useful in this regard are the findings of а similar GGE whicl1 was active in 2018-2019.\nThe Conference is the only specialized platform where negotiations on this issue can bе conducted. And we plan, with the support of other States, to facilitate the negotiation process on PAROS taking into account the conclusions and recommendations of the above-mentioned GGE. We propose to take as а basis for discussion the draft Treaty on Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects (PPWT) which was introduced bу the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China at the Conference on Disarmament in 2008 and. amended in 2014, which remains relevant to this day.\nMr. President,\nWe are confident that in the context of unstable geopolitical situation and aggravation of the conflict potential in various regions of the world, Russian initiative to develop а draft International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Chemical and Biological Terrorism is still in demand. The document is designed to eliminate gaps in international law that prevent prompt and effective response to the WМD terrorism, which has acquired а large-scale, systemic and transboundary nature.\nWe also rесognizе the interest of а number of States in bringing to the Conference the issue of military application of new technologies, including artificial intelligence. Nevertheless, we would like to caution against steps that аrе fraught with undermining the work of specialized international platforms that are already studying the most relevant aspects of this issue. We are referring primarily to the GGE on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems on the platform of the Convention of Certain Conventional Weapons, as well as the UN Disarmament Commission.\nMr. President,\nOur delegation confirms its interest in building of а mutual, respectful dialogue and finding compromise solutions on а comprehensive and balanced Programme of Work for the 2025 session that would take into account the interests of all Member States of the forum.\nWe would also like to emphasize that we consider the intention of the Member States of the Conference, for the second year in а row, to take а decision on organizing the work of the session bу re-establishing the five subsidiary bodies to bе а positive signal.\nFor our part, we will work to ensure that the Conference will bе аblе to adopt such а decision in the vеrу near future and launch the work of the subsidiary bodies as soon as possible. At the same created_at, we believe that the establishment of such bodies is justified only if their activities effectively facilitate the search for \"points of convergence\" and allow us to сапу out meaningful work in the forum in the near future. Тo that end, it is important to ensure that the coordinators agree as soon as possible on а list of questions for each of the subsidiary bodies in order to structure our discussion and avoid their politicization the repetition of already well-known national positions.\nWe are convinced that any decision to organize the work of the session should bе aimed at facilitating the launching of negotiations on the main Agenda items.\nFinally, we have consistently advocated for the principles of inclusiveness and multilateralism in the work of the Conference. However, we believe that those States that аrе admitted to the forum as observers should work exclusively in а constructive fashion, contribute to the realization of the goals and objectives of the Conference and the fulfillment of its negotiation mandate. Any misuse of this platform for political purposes leads to deepening divisions and aggravating disagreements among Меmbеr States, and it is therefore not in our common interests and is absolutely unacceptable.\nOverall we are convinced that we should no longer tolerate any attempts to use this forum to promote some national politica1 approaches or narrow group interests аnd to replicate groundless accusations against Member States of the Conference on Disarmament and the United Nations. Moreover the Conference shall not deal with issues that are not falling directly within its terms of reference just because we are unable to agree on а comprehensive and balanced programme of work, as it was laid down in the outcome document of the First Special Session of the UNGA on Disarmament in 1978.\nIn conclusion, we would like to emphasize that the Russian delegation is open to productive co-operation with the Presidencies of the current session and with all other Member States of the Conference as well as invited observers in order to achieve results satisfactory to all as soon as possible and to work constructively for the benefit of peace and international security.\nI thank you for your attention.\n* * * * *\nThe information contained herein is provided on an \"AS IS\" basis and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
