    "text": "\n The Philippines should brace for the worst and expect more intense espionage activities by Chinese spies amid an escalating conflict with China over the West Philippine Sea, Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian warned yesterday.\nIn an interview with radio dwIZ, Gatchalian said it was no longer surprising that Chinese sleeper agents were arrested by authorities at a created_at when the Philippines was upping the ante in asserting its sovereign rights in the South China Sea and defying the bullying and hostile acts of China Coast Guard vessels in the country's territorial waters.\nHe echoed the concern of President Marcos, who said he was 'very disturbed' about the reported arrests by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) of six suspected Chinese sleeper agents.\nDeng Yuanqing and his two Filipino cohorts were arrested on Jan. 17 in Makati in possession of alleged espionage equipment for mapping and transmitting data on military camps and infrastructure.\nDeng's accomplices - Cai Shaohuang, Wang Yong Yi, Wu Chin Ren, Wu Cheng Ting and Cheng Hai Tao - were arrested days later on charges of gathering information on the rotation and resupply missions of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) in Palawan, where they allegedly set up surveillance cameras and posed as tourists to map naval detachments and coast guard stations.\n'This is alarming. Chinese spies have been doing this in our country for quite some created_at, complete with equipment for their operations here. This is something we should expect. Let's be prepared,' Gatchalian said.\nHe commended the NBI for its successful operations against the suspected spies, but added that Philippine law enforcers should expand their intelligence network.\n'I commend the NBI for catching the spies in the act, but we should widen further our intelligence capability. I really think there are more spies out there,' the senator said.\nThe Senate uncovered extensive Chinese espionage, infiltration and propaganda activities during its investigation on the now banned Philippine offshore gaming operator (POGO) hubs, which served as fronts of syndicates for criminal operations, particularly human trafficking.\nDuring the POGO hearings, National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) deputy director general Francisco Acedillo said the Chinese spy network has long been entrenched in the economic and political landscape of the Philippines.\nThe most high-profile official accused of being a spy is dismissed mayor Alice Guo, tagged as having links to the raided Bamban, Tarlac POGO hub and accused of being a communist spy by gambling tycoon and self-confessed agent She Zhijiang.\nAcedillo said Guo is an 'agent of influence' who used her position for the benefit of China.\nGatchalian, who was active in the Senate POGO investigations, said Chinese spies slipped past authorities when they pretended to work for POGOs, which proliferated during the previous administration.\n'Now that POGOs are banned, the entry of spies can also be prevented, and foreign agents will find a more difficult created_at to get in and threaten our national security,' Gatchalian said.\nBureau of Immigration (BI) Commissioner Joel Anthony Viado said the arrested Chinese spies have 'regular immigration statuses in the Philippines.' He said this 'added to the suspicion that they have embedded themselves in society.'\nWhile he did not specifically identify the 'foreign nationals' as Chinese, Viado said they were those recently arrested by the NBI and the Armed Forces of the Philippines.\nViado said the BI would 'work closely with the NBI to determine if there are individuals who assisted the suspects in their supposed illegal activities.'\n'Should we confirm that there are individuals - whether Filipinos or foreign nationals - that hid or assisted these alleged spies, we will file cases against them for harboring illegal aliens, in violation of section 46 of the Philippine immigration act of 1940,' he said. \n"

    "text": "\n The Chinese coast guard is maintaining its presence off the coast of Zambales province and in the waters off Occidental Mindoro province's Cabra Island in the West Philippine Sea (WPS), well within the country's 370-kilometer exclusive economic zone (EEZ), according to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).\nPCG Commodore Jay Tarriela, the PCG spokesperson for the WPS, said the BRP Teresa Magbanua on Friday challenged the presence of China Coast Guard vessel 3304 (CCG 3304), telling it that it did not have 'legal authority to patrol' the Philippines' EEZ and ordered the ship to leave the area immediately.\nThe CCG 3304, according to Tarriela, was spotted about 190 km off Zambales while the PCG was distributing supplies to fisherfolk in the area.\n'The PCG has firmly communicated to CCG 3304 the necessity of maintaining a safe distance from Filipino fishing boats, stressing that its presence poses a significant threat to the safety of both the fishermen and their vessels,' Tarriela said.\nThe Teresa Magbanua's radio message was ignored by CCG 3304. The Chinese vessel was later replaced by the 165-meter CCG 5901, the largest coast guard vessel in the world and nicknamed 'The Monster' because of its size.\nCCG ships began 'intrusive patrols' in the waters off Zambales on Jan. 1, with the presence of CCG 5901.\n'The Philippine Coast Guard remains steadfast in its commitment to protect the rights and welfare of Filipino fishermen and ensure the security of the nation's exclusive economic zone, all while adhering to international law and avoiding provocative actions,' Tarriela said.\nThe CCG 5901 was told by the Teresa Magbanua to leave the area as it had no legal authority to patrol the Philippines' EEZ.\nIn reply, CCG 5901 said it was 'performing law enforcement duties on jurisdictional waters of the People's Republic of China.'\n'Your order was wrong ...,' it said, adding that 'China firmly upholds its territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests in South China Sea.'\nOn Saturday, US maricreated_at expert Ray Powell said nine CCG vessels were spotted in the Philippines' EEZ, including the Chinese ship near Cabra Island.\nPowell, director of SeaLight, a program of Stanford University's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation that keeps track of Chinese activities in the WPS, said CCG 3104 and CCG 3301 were conducting 'intrusive patrols' 56 km off Cabra.\nIn January last year, Chinese warship 570 shadowed Philippine and US Navy warships conducting maricreated_at drills off Cabra.\nOn Saturday, Powell said the Chinese monster ship was spotted 'midway between Scarborough Shoal and Luzon' while CCG 5202 passed within 6 km off Philippine-occupied Lawak Island.\nThe reported presence of Chinese ships in the WPS comes as Philippine authorities arrested six Chinese individuals allegedly engaging in espionage, targeting the country's military and naval sites.\nChinese spies\nPhilippines security officials announced last week the arrest of five of the six suspected Chinese spies who were allegedly monitoring Manila's resupply missions in the WPS.\nArmed Forces of the Philippines chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. said the Philippines' rotation and resupply missions may have been compromised as early as 2023, based on the National Bureau of Investigation record of the group's activities.\nPowell told the Inquirer on Saturday that it was 'not surprising' that China was spying on the Philippines.\n'Not only have we seen Chinese spies caught in other countries (including the US), we've seen plenty of indications that China was aware of Philippine missions well before they happen,' he said.\n'These indications have included everything from the movement of Chinese ships ahead of unannounced Philippine missions to PRC propaganda accounts posting social media announcements of what the Philippine Coast Guard was going to do in the future.'\nOn Friday, National Security Adviser Eduardo Año said the Philippines had 'pursued peaceful and diplomatic measures consistent with our desire to deescalate rising tensions' in the WPS.\nAccording to him, Manila's actions in the WPS 'remain compliant' with international law and 'established norms' of cooperation and diplomacy.\n"

    "text": "\nChinese-Filipino leaders are calling on Philippine authorities to exercise caution in \"sensationalising\" the recent arrests of Chinese nationals in the country for alleged espionage, warning it could fuel suspicion and discrimination against their community. \nObservers warn that amplifying such claims without solid evidence risks inflaming anti-Chinese sencreated_atnt, hurting tourism and politicising national security. They say a measured approach is needed to ensure fair investigations while preventing unnecessary paranoia. \nOfficials announced on Thursday that five Chinese nationals had been arrested in Palawan for allegedly conducting surveillance on a Philippine Coast Guard ship near the Spratly Islands. \nAuthorities said the suspects, who posed as Taiwanese tourists, installed high-resolution, solar-powered cameras at a seaside resort to monitor coastguard and navy movements. Residents reportedly saw them recording military activity. \nThe arrests follow the January 17 capture of Chinese national Deng Yuanqing and two Filipino associates in Makati, who were accused of spying on military and police facilities. Investigators have since linked the five new suspects to Deng. \nLucio Pitlo III, a geopolitical analyst and president of the Philippine Association for Chinese Studies, said that while authorities should not downplay espionage cases, \"we should avoid sensationalising them\". \n\"This will insulate the investigation from public opinion or politics, letting law enforcement and security officers conduct thorough, impartial, and credible probes,\" he said, adding that it would also prevent hurting the country's tourism industry. \nPitlo said China's resumption of more direct flights to the Philippines after last year's closure of offshore gaming operators, or Pogos, could encourage more visitors to return. \n\"But sensational handling of these alleged spy cases may dissuade them from coming. The last thing an innocent tourist wants to have is to spend a holiday in some interrogation room or prison,\" he said. \nChinese-Filipino civic leader Teresita Ang See has spoken out against Deng's arrest and called on Filipino authorities to conduct a fair probe after Deng's Filipino wife refuted claims that her husband had been engaged in gathering intelligence for Beijing. \nAng See is the co-founder of Kaisa Para sa Kaunlaran, a socio-civic organisation that has advocated for the participation of local ethnic Chinese in national development in the Philippines. \nAng See said in a statement on January 25 that Deng's wife and sister had sought her help to clear his name, and called on Philippine authorities to engage experts to determine the nature of the equipment Deng used so that any misunderstanding could be cleared up. \nDeng's wife, Noemi, also said at a press conference last week that her husband had been in the Philippines for 10 years and frequently travelled in and out of the country. \n\"We have an eight-year-old child. I am worried about what will happen to our child at school because of reports in the media that claim he is a spy,\" she said. \nAuthorities initially alleged that there were possible efforts by a \"foreign power\" to map out the country, after they found Deng and his associates in possession of data-gathering devices capable of sending sensitive information such as exact coordinates and topographic details that could be used for military targeting or drone operations. \nAng See lambasted the \"trial by publicity\" and called it a big jump to an \"iffy conclusion that China is spying on the Philippines just because a technician has road surveying instruments in his car\". \nNo one had been allowed to see Deng since his arrest, \"which worsens fears that Deng has been harmed\", she said, adding that consular visits by the Chinese embassy in Manila were also denied. \nObservers said Ang See's concerns about the probe surrounding Deng were warranted amid rising tensions between the Philippines and China. \n\"What [Ang See] did [ ...] was to cast doubt on the accusations because there was the sense that the apprehending authorities did not immediately recognise the nature of the equipment they encountered,\" said Reynard Hing, president of Kaisa Para sa Kaunlaran.  \nHing said the government could be acting in a \"heightened state of paranoia because of the constant stream of news about Chinese incursions into the Philippine exclusive economic zone\". \nEnrico Gloria, an assistant professor of political science at the University of the Philippines and a doctoral student at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said he believed Ang See spoke out \"because the government hasn't really built its case that Deng is a spy\". \n\"The government must produce credible evidence that points to Deng being a spy. The crucial element here is evidence linking his connection with the Chinese government. If they cannot produce that crucial information, then doubts are warranted,\" he said.  \nPitlo said publicising the arrests \"seem to be in line with Manila's transparency approach\" in dealing with China's incursions in the South China Sea. However, he warned that trial by publicity \"carries its own risks, not least alerting other actors who may have similar designs\". \n\"The matter further strains already worn ties between Manila and Beijing,\" he added.\n"

    "text": "\nManila, Feb. 2 -- FOR MONDAY\nAmid deteriorating relations with China, the Philippines, under the current Trump 2.0 administration, may increasingly become a \"friendshoring\" partner for the US, its former colonizer, especially in the technology sector, according to researchers at the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\"Due to shifting geopolitical dynamics with the People's Republic of China, the Philippines is exploring new energy, tourism, and infrastructure projects, presenting a potential opportunity to strengthen friendshoring initiatives with the United States,\" noted William Alan Reinsch, Scholl Chair in International Business at the Washington-based CSIS, and Scholl Chair intern Reena Samuel in a Jan. 31 blog.\nThe Switzerland-based World Economic Forum (WEF) defines friendshoring as \"rerouting of supply chains to countries perceived as politically and economically safe or low-risk, to avoid disruption to the flow of business.\nIn 2023, WEF noted that friendshoring has been \"a growing trade practice where supply chain networks are focused on countries regarded as political and economic allies.\"\nReinsch and Samuel's blog, titled \"Rocking the Boat: The Philippines Trade Strategy Amid Rising Geoeconomic Tensions\" said the Philippines has \"also taken strategic steps to strengthen its economic pathways with other nations, signifying a slowdown in their relationship with China\"-its biggest trading partner.\nFor instance, the CSIS blog recalled that when Chinese vessels rammed a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) ship and supply boat at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal -- known locally as Ayungin Shoal-back in 2023, Transportation Secretary Jaime J. Bautista subsequently announced that the Philippines had stopped securing funding from China for three big-ticket infrastructure projects under the Marcos Jr. administration's Build Better More program.\n\"Bautista [had] emphasized that the collision did not influence his decision-rather, China's delays prompted the Philippines to call on Japan, South Korea, the United States, and the European Union for 'better' deals\" in infrastructure, unlike the Chinese loan commitments secured during the previous Duterte administration, the blog noted.\nIn a Jan. 31 interview, US President Donald J. Trump's Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: \"You see it in the Indo-Pacific where every day-it's not just Taiwan; it's the Philippines-are being aggressively challenged by the Chinese militarily.\"\nFor CSIS, \"in assessing how to best engage Southeast Asia economically, the Trump administration will need to consider how the regional powers' economic and security standing has evolved vis-a-vis the United States and China.\"\nIn the case of the Philippines, CSIS pointed to the last four years-thanks to closer ties between Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden-wherein Manila \"continues to be a key piece of a successful approach for Washington.\"\nAs such, CSIS urged leveraging the stronger economic as well as military relations between the Philippines and the US since last year, amid China's more aggressive stance in South China Sea's disputed territories.\nAccording to the CSIS blog, the Philippines and the US can potentially become friendshoring partners in high-tech.\n\"The Philippines enjoys a comparative advantage in the technology sector. The Philippine semiconductor market, which has benefited greatly from the global uptick in semiconductor demand, is transitioning into more specialized areas, such as integrated circuit design and fabrication. Its semiconductor industry is expected to grow 10 to 15 percent annually until at least 2027,\" the blog pointed out.\n\"Under the Chips and Science Act's International Technology, Security, and Innovation Fund, the United States designated the Philippines as a partner-country to incentivize the Philippine semiconductor industry to become more conducive for US investors by funding initiatives such as training 128,000 semiconductor engineers and technicians by 2028. The Philippines has been increasing its high-technology exports since the early 2010s, with the top products being integrated circuits, office machine parts, gold, semiconductor devices, and insulated wire,\" it added.\nIt helps that the Philippines economy is expected to be among Southeast Asia's top performers, estimated by the Washington-based multilateral lender International Monetary Fund (IMF) to expand by 6.1 percent this year, the blog noted.\nReal gross domestic product (GDP) grew by a below-target 5.6 percent in 2024, no thanks to the damage wrought by a string of strong typhoons towards the end of last year, although it was still among the fastest expansions in the region.\nHowever, CSIS pointed to lingering energy and infrastructure gaps that must be addressed to maximize the Philippines' potential as a US friendshoring ally.\n\"To build international credibility as an attractive trading partner, the Philippines needs to develop reliable energy sources and invest in infrastructure to facilitate growth in sectors that require 24/7 connectivity,\" it explained.\nIn particular, CSIS is optimistic about recent moves by the Marcos Jr. government to revive the mothballed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant as part of its plan to incorporate nuclear energy in the country's power grid by 2032, with the help of the US, Japanese, and South Korean governments.\n\"The steps the Philippines has taken to elevate its economic standing through partnerships with other countries will likely make the country more attractive to foreign direct investment and may lessen its trade dependence on China,\" according to the CSIS blog.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

    "text": "\n In March 2017, China's People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) achieved a significant milestone when its fifth generation jet, the Chengdu J-20 Mighty Dragon stealth aircraft, entered into service. As the world's first operational stealth aircraft operationalised outside the USA, this development marked the end of the USA's monopoly on military aviation. Now only seven years down the lane, China made an even bigger bang, when video footage surfaced of a new aircraft, speculated to be sixth-generation, flying over Chengdu, China.\nThough the Chinese authorities have not yet officially confirmed the jet's existence or given it a name, the development has spurred a renewed debate around the world over what constitutes a sixth-generation fighter aircraft, China's strategic motivation, its impact on China's global power projection, and broader implications for global military aviation.\nTo completely comprehend the notion of sixth-generation fighter jets, it is significant to trace the evolution of aircraft over generations. The voyage began with the first-generation piston-engine fighters and continued to the second generation, which saw the introduction of guided missiles. The third generation witnessed the arrival of Beyond Visual Range (BVR) engagements, while the fourth generation introduced multi-role capability, as demonstrated by aircraft such as the F-16. Subsequently, fifth-generation aircraft laid the foundation for the next major advancement with their stealth technology, advanced sensor and communication systems, and super cruise capabilities through F-22 Raptor, F-35 Lightning II, J-20, J-35, and Su-57.\nThe sixth-generation aircraft is speculated to transcend the fifth-generation combat aircraft in terms of stealth capability. China is already pushing the boundaries of stealth technology in its much-discussed sixth-generation fighter jet. There is widespread speculation that the concerned aircraft is likely to have stealth materials that will be thin and lightweight and will be able to absorb both high-frequency electromagnetic waves from advanced military radars and low-frequency detection signals used by anti-stealth radars.\nThe sixth-generation aircraft are also touted as digital aircraft since they integrate control capabilities with artificial intelligence (AI) that will enable these fighters to conduct more autonomous missions, make decisions in real created_at on the battlefield, and immediately analyse volumes of data.\nMoreover, the probable integration of certain directed energy weapons (DEWs), like powerful microwaves or laser systems, is another novel feature. It is anticipated that these fighter jets will also feature an unmatched network integration becoming a part of a seamlessly integrated combat system that includes other aircraft, drones, ground stations, and satellite networks to make it effective for joint military operations. In addition, this sixth generation aircraft is also believed to have an advanced radar system capable of detecting and engaging threats at greater distance which will provide the pilots a crucial advantage in modern air battles.\nKeeping aside AMCA, India is currently struggling to induct even improved variants of its fourth-generation Tejas Mk1A and the so-called 4.5 generation MK2 fighters owing to persistent delays in procurement and dependence on foreign-built engines. In sum, this technological lag will place India in a precarious position and will weaken its stance in the region owing to the fact that it would have to deal now with fifth-gen fighters from the two sides of its border that will soon be complemented by a sixth generation fighter as well.\nConsidering the aforementioned points, it can be argued that the development will have significant implications for military aviation around the world. With the fifth-generation jets, the USA and its allies have dominated the skies for a long created_at. However, China's new inroads into sixth-generation technology have now sent a powerful message to its competitors, particularly the USA, that China is not only trying to close the gap aggressively but is also deeply committed to shaping the future of military aviation and air combat with its advanced and diverse fleet.\nConsequently, this advancement could spark a renewed arms race between China and the Western countries. Reports are already doing rounds that suggest that Western nations are likely to accelerate their sixth-generation aircraft programmes, including the USA's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) and Europe's Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), a collaborative initiative of the UK, Italy, and Japan.\nFrom a geopolitical and strategic point of view, in the wake of a sixth-generation combat aircraft, China's position is likely to be strengthened. It will enable China to leverage its cutting-edge air warfare technologies, particularly in disputed regions such as the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and other areas of its interest. In addition, it will enable China to conduct missions to potentially deny adversaries' forces operational capabilities. Consequently, it can prompt the countries, trying to impose themselves on the region, namely the USA, to reassess their defence strategies.\nAs India is trying to play the role of an offshore balancer and net security provider on behalf of the United States against China in the South Asian region, one might naturally ask how will this development impact it in the region? Like writing on the wall, it is quite obvious that the induction of sixth-generation combat aircraft by China will be no less than a nightmare for India. While China races ahead with sixth-generation fighter development, India is still grappling with the challenge of countering fifth-generation combat aircraft not only from China but also from Pakistan, which is set to acquire the Chinese fifth-generation J-35 fighters by 2026.\nIndia's much-touted first fifth-generation stealth fighter project Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), is still a dream which is years away from producing even a flying prototype, let alone its eventual induction into the Indian Air Force (IAF), which according to many experts is at least a decade away.\nKeeping aside AMCA, India is currently struggling to induct even improved variants of its fourth-generation Tejas Mk1A and the so-called 4.5 generation MK2 fighters owing to persistent delays in procurement and dependence on foreign-built engines. In sum, this technological lag will place India in a precarious position and will weaken its stance in the region owing to the fact that it would have to deal now with fifth-gen fighters from the two sides of its border that will soon be complemented by a sixth generation fighter as well.\n"
