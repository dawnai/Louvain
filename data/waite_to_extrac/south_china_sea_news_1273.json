    "text": "\n       By J\\xF6rn Petring and Johannes Neudecker, dpa   BEIJING (dpa-AFX) - Journalists covering the Chinese National People's Congress, which holds a week-long meeting in Beijing from Tuesday, will not have a chance to ask Premier Li Qiang any questions, as the government unexpectedly cancelled a press conference.  Li will not hold the meeting with journalists at the end of the week-long session, National People's Congress spokesman Lou Qinjian said in Beijing on Monday. In previous years, the press conference was always a rare opportunity for the premier to answer questions from reporters.  Journalists are also out of luck for the coming years, as Lou said the press conference will not take place then either - unless there are special circumstances.   When asked about the cancellation of the event, which is traditionally scheduled for the end of the congress, the Foreign Ministry said there is no reason for media representatives to be concerned that China is not open enough.  \"I think this concern is unnecessary,\" spokeswoman Mao Ning said in Beijing. She emphasized that every session of Congress is open to the media.   Lou said journalists will be given more opportunities to ask questions of ministers and other government officials.   At one week, this year's National People's Congress is also comparatively short. The rather ceremonial event - at which almost 3,000 delegates from the unelected parliament approve plans and goals of the government led by state and party leader Xi Jinping - begins on Tuesday and is scheduled to conclude next Monday, March 11.  This year's focus is on China's economic growth targets for the nation with an estimated 1.4 billion people. Due to the economic crisis in the world's second-largest economy, domestic and foreign companies in particular are likely to be hoping for important signals from the meeting.   Observers are also paying attention to the military budget in light of China's tensions with Taiwan and the nuclear power's territorial claims in the South China Sea.   Party congress spokesman Lou defended the army's spending on Monday, saying Chinese expenditure is relatively low compared to the United States.  In 2023, the People's Republic increased its defence budget by 7.2%  to 1.5537 trillion yuan ($216 billion). The increase in spending was therefore significantly higher than China's economic growth, which amounted to 5.2% in 2023.  Lou offered little insight into the Chinese stance on the upcoming US elections. He said that is an internal matter for the United States.  No matter who is elected, China hopes for stable co-operation, he said.  In front of the assembled reporters in the Great Hall of the People, however, he criticized the somecreated_ats \"anti-Chinese\" statements made by members of the US Congress and visits by US politicians to Taiwan.   The Communist Party counts Taiwan as part of the territory of the People's Republic, although it has never ruled the democratic island and regularly criticizes countries that have exchanges with Taipei.   Washington is an ally of Taiwan and has pledged support in the event of an attack.   Copyright dpa    \n"

It is not policy that has been foisted upon us by any country,\" he said.\n   The Philippines would work with China on matters of aligning interests and respectfully disagree on areas where views differed, Mr Marcos Jr said.\n   \"We shall never surrender even a square inch of our territory,\" he said.\n   \"The future of this region will be shaped not by one or two, but by many actors, and they will each demand that their voices be heard individually and collectively.\"\n   Mr Marcos Jr signalled support for the AUKUS agreement, under which the US and Britain will provide Australia with nuclear submarines.\n   \"AUKUS will enhance regional stability,\" he said.\n   \"A coalition, because it has a larger base, is much more robust in resisting any kind of unilateral move by any other country.\"\n   About 40 people brandishing signs and banners gathered outside the ASEAN summit at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre earlier on Monday to oppose Mr Marcos Jr's visit.\n   The group called for Australia to cut ties with the Philippines due to alleged human rights abuses.\n   The protesters carried a black cardboard coffin with \"RIP Democracy\" scrawled on its side.\n   A paper mache effigy of what appeared to be the head of Mr Marcos Jr, with a social media dog filter and a US flag as its tongue, was placed atop the coffin.\n   Human Rights Watch has alleged that extra-judicial drug-related killings and the abuse of human rights defenders have continued under Mr Marcos Jr's government, following on from the previous Duterte administration.\n   The Philippines leader is in Melbourne to attend the three-day ASEAN summit alongside officials from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, Singapore and Thailand.\n   Australia is not a formal member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations but has been a dialogue partner for the past 50 years.\n"

    "text": "\nNew Delhi: Shedding hesitations of the past, Germany now wants to strongly boost strategic-defence cooperation with India in areas ranging from arms sales and joint production of advanced military hardware like submarines to military interoperability in the Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China’s agg ressive muscle-flexing in the region. “We have earlier been very hesitant. Now, there is clear political will in Germany to increase defence cooperation with India through military visits, exercises, co-production and other areas, including new ones like cyber,” German ambassador Philipp Ackermann said, in an exclusive interview with TOI. The “huge paradigm shift” in Germany’s strategic thinking is primarily due to the “wake-up call” following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as well as China’s expansionist  behaviour in violation of the international rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific. \n“We want to boost cooperation with our strategic partners outside the Nato area. Germany feels India is a very good partner in this region for strategic coopera tion because we have so many common interests and values. In our military and stra tegic thinking, we think in terms of alliances, never alone,” Ackermannsaid. “We feel it’s important to have a very strong presence in the Indo-Pacific to guarantee freedom of navigation. We have seen activities in the South China Sea and Indo-Pacific where one country (read China) is showing teeth. There is a lot of global and German concern about this,” he added. As part of the Indo-Pacific deployments, a huge contingent of 32 German aircraft, including eight Eurofighter and 12 Tornado jets as well as Airbus-300 MRTT tankers and  Airbus-400M military transport planes, along with 15 French and Spanish aircraft, will take part in IAF’s largest multination ‘Tarang Shakti’ exercise (Phase-1) in Coimbatore in Aug. Then, a frontline German frigate and combat support ship will also be visiting Goa in Oct. “Our aim is to increase interoperability with India and other like-minded countries in the Indo-Pacific like the US, Japan, Europe and Australia. We never go alone. There is a  clear commitment from our side that we should increase our military visits and exercises with India,” the ambassador said. On the defence production front, Germany is one of the two main contenders in India’s long-delayed over Rs 42,000 crore project to build six advanced stealth dieselelectric submarines with foreign collaboration. Towards this, an MoU to cooperate in submarine production was inked between defence shipyard Mazagon Docks (MDL) and German company ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) in the presence of visiting German defence minister Boris Pistorius in June last year. Spanish firm Navantia is the other foreign contender in this mega ‘Project-75 India’ project. “The (selection) process is still ongoing. The decision is for India to take. But there is clear willingness and preparedness from the German side  to support this Indian project,” Ackermann said. “The first group of Indian naval officers will be visiting Germany to evaluate the boats, which offer AIP (air-independent propulsion for greater underwater endurance), in the next 10 days. We have put a good offer on the table and are ready to fine-tune it further. The German government is very supportive of the TKMS proposal with MDL,” he said. Germany is also ready to supply A400M transport aircraft, A330 MRTT mid-air refuelling aircraft, heavyweight torpedoes and spare parts for small arms, among other things, to India. “The next level in the bilateral defence cooperation will be to sit with India and figure out what we can develop together. India does it with countries like the US and France. So, why not with Germany? That will be the next step,” Ackermann said.\n"

    "text": "\nThe first cancellation in three decades of the only annual press conference of the Premier and head of the Chinese economy, Li Qiang, in the framework of the Legislative meeting this week shakes the agenda of the most important event of the year in a convulsive economic context in the Asian power.\nThe spokesman of the National People's Congress (NPC, Legislative) Lou Qinjian surprised Monday by announcing that Li, a man of confidence of the country's president, Xi Jinping, will not offer the traditional annual press conference at the end of the plenary session of the text, which opens tomorrow, Tuesday.\nLi did attend the media last year, just after his appointment as prime minister of the Asian giant, following an annual custom dating back to 1993. Lou argued today that Li will no longer submit to reporters' questions because \"he already laid out the main lines of his mandate last year when he took office.\"\nAccording to the spokesman, the prime minister will present tomorrow, Tuesday, the government's work report, which, together with the planning and budget reports of the National Development and Reform Commission (the country's main planning text) and the Ministry of Finance, \"will provide answers to the main social concerns.\"\nThis is one of the few occasions in which the head of the Chinese Executive answers questions from journalists, although these are agreed in advance, at a created_at when investors and analysts were expecting more clarity on the country's economic roadmap for this year.\nThe prime minister's appearance will be split into two press conferences on economic issues and on \"people's livelihoods\" to be given by two lower-ranking officials whose identities have not yet been disclosed.\nWang Xiangwei, former editor-in-chief of Hong Kong's South China Morning Post, told the newspaper that the move illustrates the new role of the executive branch as a mere \"executor\" of Communist Party (CCP) decisions.\n\"The role and status of the prime minister has been adapted accordingly. It is also a reflection of Li's pragmatism, which is more focused on policy direction. He thinks ministers are in a better position to give details,\" he adds.\nOther analysts quoted by the newspaper say Li's non-appearance implies \"a shift in power dynamics,\" where the premier has a lower profile, although it may be \"a missed opportunity for China to explain itself\" and a risk because \"it will raise perceptions about its lack of transparency.\"\nStimulus measures?\nAt the opening of the session, Li will unveil China's growth forecasts for 2024 after having grown by 5.2% in 2023, meeting the official target set by the authorities but in a context of slowdown following the real estate slump, deflationary pressures, sluggish domestic consumption and weak external demand.\nFor analysts, the most important thing will be to know what stimulus tools the government is willing to use.\nAccording to a recent survey of experts conducted by the news portal Yicai, China will set its growth target at 5%, which, according to Huang Wentao, chief economist at China Securities, will help \"improve expectations and boost confidence\".\nOther experts, such as Luo Zhiheng, believe that this target \"could alleviate the negative trends in the real economy, the recent slumps in the capital markets and social anxiety\".\nHowever, the ease of achieving a 5% growth rate will not be the same as last year due to the comparative base effect, as in 2022 the GDP of the world's second largest economy had grown by only 3% in the face of tough restrictions under the 'zero covid' policy.\nOn the other hand, the NPA will also address other issues such as the defense budget amid tensions in the South China Sea and the eye on Taiwan, or an amendment to the law on state secrets, which comes after several investigations against foreign consulting firms operating in the country, sowing concern in the sector.\nAll this while the CCP continues to sharpen its anti-corruption campaign promoted years ago by Xi, who consolidated his power at the head of the country during the 20th Congress held by the formation in 2022.\nThere had also been speculation that the NPA might appoint a new foreign minister, but, as noted today by the state agency Xinhua, \"there will be no personnel changes\" in this year's session, in which the current head of the portfolio, Wang Yi, is scheduled to give a press conference during the week.\n"

    "text": "\nMarch 4th, 2024 ( Deutsche Welle World  — Delivered by  Newstex )\nVietnam authorities arrested a popular YouTube blogger last week.But why is the Vietnamese government cracking down on independent voices?Nguyen Chi Tuyen, also known as Anh Chi, was detained in Vietnam under anti-state charges on Thursday.The YouTube influencer is being investigated for disseminating information against the Vietnamese state and will spend four months in detention in Hanoi while authorities conduct their inquiries.Tuyen is one of Vietnam's most known civil society activists.He was part of the No-U group, an anti-China group that rejected Beijing's U-shaped line in its attempts to control territory in the South China Sea.Focusing on key influencersTuyen has successful YouTube channels, including one on which he discusses foreign affairs - including Russia's war in Ukraine.Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington D.C. who focuses on Southeast Asia politics and security, said Anh Chi was the latest influential activist to be targeted.For independent journalists, there has been a swath of cyber laws, decrees, and policies that have raised the costs, imposed civil fines, and shifted the onus to policing to the social media platforms themselves, he told DW.Through these measures, the government hopes that self-censorship will do most of the work for them.The Ministry of Public Security has focused its attention more on the key influencers.Anh Chi, who ran a very popular YouTube channel, is just the latest, he added.'Ensuring national security'Vietnam is a one-party Communist state in Southeast Asia whose government has complete control over the state's functions, social organizations and media.Although Vietnam has a fast-growing economy, the country still has a poor reputation on corruption, political censorship, human rights and civic society.In February, leaked documents from Vietnam's Politburo, the highest decision-making government text, revealed a rare insight into the thinking of its leaders.It showed how the Vietnam government's policies aim to ensure national security, including preventing civil society from shaping the country's policies and creating opposition groups.The dossier Directive 24 was obtained and translated by The 88 Project, a US-based organization that campaigns for freedom of expression in Vietnam.As of today, there are 176 activists in Vietnamese prisons, according to the project.Nguyen Phu Trong has been single-mindedly focused on taking Vietnam's nascent civil society apart.He's gone after sector by sector, including the bar association, environmentalists and independent journalists.Directive 24 encapsulates his thinking about the threat posed by civil society in leading a colored revolution, Abuza said.But Vietnam's high-level meetings with two of the world's major superpowers have also played a part in Hanoi's growing assertiveness over its domestic policies.The United States and Vietnam upgraded their ties to comprehensive strategic partners in September following a visit to Vietnam from US President Joe Biden.Hanoi has been emboldened by the fact that there have been two US administrations that have not raised human rights as a bilateral issue, Abuza said.Trump simply didn't care.The Biden administration said that human rights would be central to its foreign policy, but in its courtship with Hanoi, it has all been ignored.Chinese leader Xi Jinping also visited Hanoi in December to discuss the two countries' shared future.Vietnam does learn from China when it comes to developing laws and regulations to monitor the internet - but the leaders in Hanoi are in a bind as the internet, unlike China, is open and Vietnam is a much more open society than China, Abuza added.The Communist Party of Vietnam leaders have the same concerns as China, but they don't have all the coercive measures, so there is a degree of paranoia.Climate activists 'tread on important toes'Environmentalists have also said they have faced intimidation and harassment from Vietnamese authorities, and many who have challenged the government's energy policies have ended up being sentenced to prison terms for tax evasion or fraud - a common tactic of repression by Vietnam's communist government.The 88 Project said there is evidence that they were imprisoned to silence their voices and remove them from society.Bill Hayton, associate fellow at Chatham House Asia-Pacific in London, said at the created_at that activists tend to tread on important toes.Hayton told DW that by criticizing the state-owned coal industry, they are upsetting powerful domestic interests in Vietnam.And that's brought them some enemies.Edited by: Keith Walker\nLink to the original story.N"

    "text": "\nDiplomacy It is unrealistic to think the outcome of this week's summit will be the next step in Australia building a broader network of Asian allies against China.\nLate last week Philippines President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos jnr used the opportunity of a forthright speech to the Australian parliament to tighten ties with Canberra in a highly contested maricreated_at environment.\nThat dramatic speech, going where few ASEAN states would want to follow, is testament to what being at the forefront of Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea can do to a nation's strategic psychology.\nThat might well encourage thinking that the next logical step is a broader network of partners in the rest of South-East Asia that unite in their efforts to maintain US regional engagement in a period of ongoing suspicion of Beijing's intentions.\nBut it is unrealistic to think this will be an outcome from this week's ASEAN summit. Australia will still use the summit to upgrade its relationship with Vietnam - another state on the frontline with China - to a \"comprehensive strategic partnership.\"\nMore broadly the focus of the summit will focus on the economic potential still to be realised in Australia-ASEAN relations, as well as developing further opportunities in climate change, clean energy and maricreated_at security. That's where the rubber will hit the road in this, the biggest international gathering of leaders on Australian soil since the last ASEAN-Australia summit in 2016.\nThis Labor government pays regular obeisance to \"ASEAN centrality\". It says it comes to the region \"to listen not to lecture\", not to force a choice on ASEAN states in the prevailing US-China dynamic.\nBut ASEAN continues to be misunderstood in parts of the Australian foreign policy establishment, particularly given its \"hedging\", \"balancing\" and \"bandwagoning\" between the US and China. The pundits and former policymakers who were the chief architects of the \"China threat\" narrative in recent years want ASEAN to exercise more agency by targeting Beijing.\nBut as this week's meeting will again show, it is a mistake to squeeze ASEAN into binary thinking at a created_at when that rigidity is increasingly less relevant to strategic thought. ASEAN has been historically conditioned to navigate multipolarity even as the US-China dynamic still defines the regional geopolitical landscape.\nASEAN's triumph bears repeating. Since it was formed in 1967 the region, apart from Cambodia, has not suffered from a major war between its members. The problems of social upheaval caused by rapid industrialisation and urbanisation have been the most common and fundamental challenges. In some of these nations there are additionally communal, ethnic or religious tensions.\nAs the former Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan notes, \"ASEAN kept the peace in South-East Asia by easing the innate suspicions, complications and tensions that are attendant upon these permanent conditions\".\nThis relative calm has been a great plus for Australia. Consider that in the late 1960s at the created_at of ASEAN's formation, Canberra was endeavouring to engage with the countries and cultures of Asia in a new way. The shibboleths of \"White Australia\" and forward defence were no more.\nThis period constituted nothing less than a revolution in Australia's foreign policy. It sought to come to terms with a region that was at last free from Western domination and resolved to shape its own future.\nAustralia presented itself not as a junior ally of the former Western masters but as a good neighbour who was also naturally and properly a member of the region. The watchword became, as Gareth Evans once put it, \"comprehensive engagement\" with Asia. And while this was intended to be the motif for Australia's policy for the whole of East Asia, it was particularly directed towards South-East Asia.\nThe governments of Whitlam and Fraser, along with Hawke and Keating, knew that regional acceptance lay largely in Australia's relations with ASEAN states, especially Indonesia.\nThis was the case even though from the beginning the ASEAN countries made it clear that they did not consider Australia eligible to join their association. Australia, initially, found itself on the outside and therefore had to respond from the outside.\nUnder the prevailing US hegemony at the created_at of its foundation, it was easier for ASEAN to maintain the order between the original five, then six, non-communist states - Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand and later Brunei. ASEAN did its best work from the 1970s to the 1990s in creating a culture of consensus, or as Kausikan puts it, \"not so much by building trust but by managing mistrust\". This was then expanded to all 10 ASEAN members following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nBut from 2009 with the rise of China's power and influence, alongside the resilience of strong national interests of ASEAN states, finding a consensus among members has been more difficult. But here again Kausikan makes a key point: by allowing regionalism to coexist with nationalism, the region's multipolarity is a given, and that stimulates manoeuvrability for ASEAN members.\nThe Albanese government has its rhetoric and its forward-looking economic strategy on South-East Asia in alignment for a good reason.\nThat will likely be the limits of the outcome of this week's Summit. ASEAN by its nature is allergic to any strong communique nailing its colours to the mast in the great power struggle between the US and China. This also means Australia speaks with something of a forked tongue in the region. There's ASEAN centrality then there's AUKUS.\nJames Curran is The Australian Financial Review's international editor and professor of modern history at Sydney University.\n"

    "created_at": "2024-03-04",
    "text": "\nThe man who led Australia’s search for Mhl0 has urged the Australian government to support any new effort to find the plane, which disappeared 10 years ago on Friday.\nOn Sunday the Malaysian government said it was in talks with the US marine robotics company Ocean Infinity  to discuss a new search. The company says it is willing and able to return to the search and has submitted a proposal to the Malaysian government.\nThe Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 departed Kuala Lumpur on 8 March 2014, bound for Beijing with 12 crew and 227 passengers on board – including seven Australians. About 40 minutes later it disappeared from the radar and its fate remains unknown.\nThe Malaysian government initially did a surface search in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca. But electronic blips picked up by satellites indicated the plane had turned around, flown until it ran out of fuel, then plunged into the Indian Ocean between Western Australia and Antarctica.\nAt that point Australia took over, with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) leading the Indian Ocean underwater search effort from May 2014 to early 2017.\nPeter Foley, the program director for the ATSB-led search, said the longer any search was delayed, the smaller the chance that flight data recorders would still be useful. He would like to see the Australian government support a new effort.\n“It’s been six years,” Foley said. \n“We know that it’s close to the seventh arc in the southern Indian Ocean,” he added, referring to a band of water where the plane made its final satellite “handshakes”.\n“We just need another search.”\nDuring the ATSB search period, debris washed up on islands in the Indian Ocean and along the African coast, which helped CSIRO drift modellers narrow down the possible crash site.\nIn 2018, the Malaysian government commissioned Ocean Infinity to do a second search on a “no find, no fee” basis. That was unsuccessful. Until now, Malaysia has consistently said it would not start a new search unless there was “new and credible information”.\nThe chief executive of Ocean Infinity, Oliver Plunkett, said the company also wanted to resume the search and was hopeful it would happen this year.\n“We remain interested in returning to the search for Mhl0 and are actively engaged in trying to make this happen,” he said in a statement. “We now feel in a position to be able to return to the search for missing aircraft Mhl0, and have submitted a proposal to the Malaysian government.\n“We hope to get back to the search soon.”\nMalaysia’s transport minister, Anthony Loke, said Malaysia was committed to finding the plane and “cost is not the issue”.\nHe said he would meet Ocean Infinity officials to discuss a new operation.\n“We are now awaiting for them to provide suitable dates and I hope to meet them soon,” he said.\nThe victims’ families have never stopped calling for more to be done. \nI feel desperately sad for the families of the 239 people on board that aircraft who still have no answers\n  Peter Foley    \nOn Sunday hundreds of relatives and supporters gathered near Kuala Lumpur to remember the missing and support calls for a fresh search.\nChinese families have also written to the Malaysian government calling for the investigation to be reopened. \nNot only is the plane’s whereabouts unknown, so is the reason for its disappearance. Much suspicion has fallen on one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and the possibility of a mass murder/suicide. Others have speculated about a “controlled ditching” or long glide, which might mean the plane travelled further than previously thought, and was under control, before hitting the water.\nThe ATSB has pushed back on that theory. It believes the speed of the plane’s descent meant it was freefalling and the pilot was unconscious.\nIn the absence of answers, theories are rife. Expert and amateur investigators have continued their own analyses.\nRichard Godfrey is a founding member of the Mhl0 Independent Group and has worked to debunk many conspiracy theories.\nHe has been studying the weak signal propagation reporter network, a global database of amateur radio waves that can be disturbed by aircraft, for clues. He said those clues, along with the satellite handshakes and drift modelling, pointed to areas of the Indian Ocean that have not yet been searched.\nHe said he thought the plane would be found this year.\n“I would like to see governments do something, rather than nothing,” he said. “The flying public … the aviation industry and the Mhl0 next of kin are all looking for answers.”\nFoley said he was “always hopeful” the plane would be found but that required investment from the Australian government.\n“Because I know there’s absolutely no chance that the aircraft would be found unless we’re looking for it,” he said.\n“The last search was 2018, that’s six years ago. And I feel desperately sad for the families of the 239 people on board that aircraft who still have no answers. It’s an absolute tragedy.\n“We need to go again.”\n"

    "text": "\nLink to Story\nNEW HAVEN - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's long-delayed trip to Beijing has come and gone. Despite the predictable optimistic spin on the visit, both sides agreed to strengthen people-to-people exchanges and promised to continue talks, it did little to defuse the increasingly fraught conflict between the United States and China.The failure to reestablish military-to-military communications is especially worrisome, given the recent spate of near-misses between the two superpowers' warships in the Taiwan Strait and aircraft over the South China Sea. And this is to say nothing of reported Chinese surveillance and military activity in Cuba, which bears an eerie resemblance to the events that precipitated the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, one of the most frightening moments of the Cold War. The risks of accidental conflict, as underscored in my recent book, remain high.\nThe underlying problem is overreliance on personalised diplomacy. Yes, that played a crucial role in the early days of the US-China relationship. More than just stagecraft, US president Richard Nixon's historic trip to China in 1972 was a decisive strategic gambit aimed at the triangulation of the former Soviet Union. Multiple layers of personal connections helped to tip the balance of power in the first Cold War: Nixon and Mao Zedong at the top, underpinned by Henry Kissinger and Zhou Enlai working out the details of US-China engagement.\nBut those days are over. Personalised diplomacy has outlived its usefulness. With management of the US-China relationship in the hands of politically constrained, thin-skinned leaders, disputes between the two superpowers have become exceedingly difficult to resolve. Neither leader can afford to be seen as weak. Conflict resolution is now more about face, less about grand strategy.\nPresident Xi Jinping, for example, insisted on sitting at the head of the table in his brief 35-minute meeting with Blinken, casting America's senior diplomat in a decidedly subservient light. And no sooner had Blinken left the country than President Joe Biden referred to the Chinese leader as a dictator, further inflaming the sensitivities of a country steeped in the painful memories of a century of humiliation.\nSuch an approach no longer works because diplomacy derives its legitimacy from domestic politics. On the American side, poisonous anti-China sencreated_atnt tied Blinken's hands long before he set foot in Beijing. US Representative Mike Gallagher, the Republican Chairman of the new House Select Committee on China, has the audacity to blame America's China problem on engagement, arguing on CNBC and in the Wall Street Journal that\"engagement invariably leads to appeasement in the face of foreign aggression\".\nUnfortunately, Gallagher speaks for a strident anti-China Washington consensus, and that left Blinken with few options. Bipartisan support of such an extreme view all but ruled out any creative US diplomacy.\nDespite its one-party system, domestic political considerations are equally important in China. The legitimacy of Xi's power rests on his so-called Chinese Dream, which promises\"the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\". Yet, without sustained economic growth, Xi risks breaking that promise and facing a wave of public and Party anger.\nThat makes China's current growth shortfall especially concerning. While a widely expected stimulus could alleviate near-term pressures on the economy, the confluence of demographic and productivity headwinds is far more problematic for medium- to longer-term growth prospects. Add to that the foregone growth that comes from ongoing conflict with the US and its allies, and there can be little doubt that Chinese politics are tightly constrained by the country's mounting\"rejuvenation deficit\".\nFragile egos only exacerbate the problem. Rhetorical miscues, such as Biden's\"autocracy versus democracy\" framework; stagecraft, such as Xi's chair positioning; and name-calling, such as Biden's\"dictator\" jab, all get blown out of proportion. When leaders lack the tough skin required for conflict resolution, the hair-trigger reactions of personalised diplomacy backfire.\nA new approach is urgently needed. Shifting to a more institutionalised model of engagement would take conflict resolution out of the hands of hyper-reactive, politically constrained leaders. That means reworking the architecture of US-China engagement to be more process-oriented, to incorporate greater technical expertise at the working-group level, and to focus more on a strategy of mutual problem-solving.\nMy proposal for a US-China secretariat goes well beyond earlier attempts at institutional engagement - namely, the Strategic and Economic Dialogue and the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade. Both efforts failed to prevent the current conflict, before being canceled by the Trump administration (Biden has opted not to resuscitate the initiatives). But that is because they didn't go far enough in providing a permanent, robust framework for relationship management.\nLike most, I am suspicious of a bureaucratic approach to multiple thorny problems between two powerful countries. The Washington consensus believes the Chinese have long favored talk over action, process over compliance, temporising over compromise. A new bureaucracy, the argument goes, would add complexity and layers of decision-making to the already-challenging task of addressing fundamental disagreements between contrasting systems. Progress will still be difficult.\nStill, a more institutionalised approach is preferable to the current politicised, personalised diplomacy. What worked 50 years ago does not work today. The context is very different for both countries: China is now a legitimate challenger to the incumbent hegemon. Conflict resolution needs far more than a latter-day Nixon going to China.\nPersonalised diplomacy is at a dead end in resolving the US-China conflict. Escaping from the quagmire of escalating tensions requires a new architecture of engagement. A US-China secretariat is the best option to navigate the long and arduous path of conflict resolution, before it is too late.\nStephen S.

    "text": "\nIn speeches and interventions by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Philippine President Bongbong Marcos we see two contrasting, indeed contradictory, ASEAN approaches to China.\n, Marcos thundered, concerning Beijing's incursions into waters around The Philippines. By contrast, Anwar declared: \"If they (the US) have a problem with China, they should not impose it on us; we do not have a problem with China.\"\nAnthony Albanese essentially talked but said nothing in response to both leaders.\nAustralia's position with ASEAN over China, pre the Albanese government, was perfectly fine. It still is, unless Canberra decides to solve a problem that doesn't exist and thereby creates a new one.\nLet me explain. Here's a hot scoop. The 10 member nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have already been tipped off to the news that Australia is a longstanding strategic and military ally of the US, and that we have quite a lot of problems with Beijing's regional behaviour.\nGenerally, ASEAN wants Australia to maintain its strategic identity, though not all of them can always say so publicly.\nFirst, let's pause to pay tribute to Marcos and Anwar. They both represent real democracy. Marcos overcame the once negative legacy of his family name to resoundingly win a democratic election. He's a much better president than Rodrigo Duterte was and he has restored strategic stability to Manila.\n. He spent years in jail on trumped-up charges of sodomy. His life is a triumph of democratic activism. That's not to say that both men haven't said and done things over their careers that Australians would find difficult.\nBut let's be frank, ASEAN is diverse and internally divided. Recognition of this is its great strength, Its monumental achievement, through relentless and exhausting diplomatic processes, has been to render internal state on state military conflict within Southeast Asia almost unthinkable.\nIn that, its achievement is at least as great as the EU's. But its impact beyond Southeast Asia itself has ranged from slight to negligible. That's not a criticism of ASEAN. But it naturally flows from its internal diversity, not least in relation to China.\n. Thailand and The Philippines are military allies of the US, although both Washington and Canberra lost a lot of influence in Bangkok when they foolishly boycotted the Thai government after a military coup.\nIndonesia is dedicatedly non-aligned. It wants and needs Chinese money but it also has a big spate of arguments with Beijing. And it has a long history of spasmodic persecution of its ethnic Chinese minority. \nMalaysia blows hot and cold on China. It wants China's money and internal Islamic politics reinforce an inclination to put some distance between itself and Washington. Malaysia, too, has a history of some conflict between ethnic Malays and its Chinese minority and has laws that emtext positive discrim­ination in favour of Malays against ethnic Chinese and Indians.\nBut Malaysia, with Singapore, is also a member of the Five Power Defence Arrangements with Australia, our only formal quasi-military alliance in Southeast Asia. Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei are majority Muslim nations.\n, economically and politically involved in Southeast Asia.\nAll the Southeast Asian nations, even the Chinese strategic clients, are more than a bit scared of China. They could well share Tony Abbott's droll private joke that Australia's view of China is driven by two contradictory emotions: fear and greed.\nThis Southeast Asian fear of China means they virtually all want the US to remain involved in the region. \nThe greatest weakness of the US in Southeast Asia is the lack of a trade and economic agenda, though it is a big source of both investment and aid. \nBut all the Southeast Asians recognise that Australia is a significant force helping to tie the US to the region. They also recognise that Canberra has more influence in Washington than any Southeast Asian nation does.\nTherefore, they're delighted if we take a stronger line against Chinese ultra-assertiveness in the South China Sea, its cyber attacks, its campaigns of political interference and all the rest. \nMostly, they don't want to take such positions publicly themselves. Their own politics don't work that way and they're a bit worried about Chinese retaliation. We are wealthy, distant, protected by the US alliance and have a Western-style dialectical political culture, which means it's expected that we take stronger positions.\nNo one in ASEAN wants us to try to be faux Southeast Asians ourselves. That doesn't work. Lee Kuan Yew derided Gough Whitlam as \"a sham white Afro-Asian\". We're not ASEAN members, nor should we want membership. ASEAN has all kinds of rules, such as referring all disputes to an ASEAN Council, which notext observes but that would tangle us up endlessly.\nForeign Minister Penny Wong seems to have made an analytical mistake in her approach to ASEAN. \nThus in a strange speech on Monday she framed the challenge to the region not as assertive Chinese behaviour that undermines the rules and norms of international conduct. \nRather, she framed the problem as \"strategic competition\" between the US and China, as though the two superpowers were equally to blame for this, or as though strategic competition were some kind of freak of nature, or approaching storm, in which we had no view as to right and wrong. This is analytically and politically misjudged.\nThe Albanese government has become publicly pusillanimous. It speaks of China now far more timidly than it did in its first months in office.\nEnter ASIO director-general Mike Burgess. In a carefully worded and well-judged speech, Burgess described the actions of a foreign \"A-team\" of spies and diplomats targeting Australia. Everyone knew he meant China and this has been confirmed in numerous press reports. In authorised and clear public interventions in the past, Burgess has explicitly called out China, in relation to cyber theft.\nCalls for Burgess to name an ex-politician, of which there are hundreds in Australia, he says was compromised by the A-team are completely misplaced. ASIO primarily collects intelligence, not legal evidence. Intelligence can be urgent but not fit for court. Burgess achieved his overriding communications objective, which was to warn of foreign, specifically Chinese, interference.\n. It shouldn't be left primarily to agency heads to tell Australians about their strategic environment. No one in ASEAN wants us to become New Zealand which, despite its promising new government, has had no strategic input or consequence in Asia for the past 30 years.\n\nNotes\nDocument links may not lead to an active page.

    "text": "\n                                               Source: The Conversation (Au and NZ) - By Nicholas Farrelly, Pro Vice-Chancellor, University of Tasmania\nThis year marks 50 years since Australia established diplomatic ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the political bloc that represents over 650 million people across 10 countries in the region.\nOver the years, the relationship has benefited both sides. In 2022, for instance, trade between Australia and ASEAN reached around A$178 billion - greater than our two-way trade with Japan, the United States or the European Union.\nHowever, this is a pivotal created_at in the region with many pressing challenges, from the ongoing conflict in Myanmar to competing claims and rising tensions with China over the South China Sea.\nIn research for a new report being released today for the start of the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit - written with scholars Lina A. Alexandra from Indonesia, Sharon Seah from Singapore and Kimly Ngoun from Cambodia - we identified many challenges facing the relationship.\nFor example, many of the analysts, academics, policymakers and young leaders we interviewed said Australia has rarely, if ever, been as attentive to Southeast Asia as it has in recent years.\nThese experts wondered whether this level of enthusiasm, resourcing and engagement could survive a significant geopolitical or economic shock. They raised gentle questions about the viability of long-term Australian engagement in the region at a created_at when migration, terrorism and strategic competition are, once again, prominent in the Australian public debate.\nAs one senior Indonesian analyst told me:\nIt is natural that relations between Australia and ASEAN should be good. We take this for granted. And we take for granted that it will still be in good in the future. But might it not be so good?\n        Read more:        Cambodia's new leader may sound like a reformer in Australia next week, but little has changed back home\n'We have a very positive sense of Australia'\nIn our study, we found the greatest divergence of views on the strength of the relationship is not based on geography. Rather, it is generational.\nThe emphasis among older, established analysts and policymakers is on sustaining institutional links and maintaining high-level connections between the two sides - traditionally considered the essence of good diplomacy.\nYounger leaders, however, were almost all heavily focused on the need to find more innovative and creative ways to foster exchanges. Many had their earliestexperiences of ASEAN-Australia engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic, when they were confined to home and connected to the world through Zoom and other virtual meeting spaces.\nThey would also like greater opportunities to connect with like-minded, emerging Australian leaders, particularly on issues related to the environment, and social and human rights.\nThe reality, according to one young ASEAN leader, is \"we have a very positive sense of Australia, but the Australia-ASEAN relationship isn't something that immediately comes to mind\".\nThe reason, he suggests, is that the great power rivalry between the United States and China dominates much of the discussion among leaders in Southeast Asia. This leaves less space to consider other important countries contributing to the region's success, such as Australia.\nOn the flip side, Australians have likely underestimated the importance of ASEAN and its role in resolving conflicts \"in a quiet and understated way\", as one senior Australian business figure told me. He added:\nWe have often desperately underestimated the value of ASEAN for managing China. [...] Because in Southeast Asia they're not shouting we assume they are subservient.\nRather than presuming to act as mediator or providing our own guidance on managing these relationship, perhaps the more prudent Australian approach would be to spend as much created_at as possible listening. There are many thoughtful voices in the region considering their own futures adjacent to China.\n        Read more:        Why is southeast Asia so concerned about AUKUS and Australia's plans for nuclear submarines?\nThe next generation leading the way\nIn this context, our report offers some recommendations on how to develop a stronger Australia-ASEAN partnership.\nIn response to what younger Southeast Asian leaders told us, for instance, we believe a future-focused ASEAN-Australia Centre should be established. This centre could focus on analytically driven and commercially oriented ways to bring Australia and Southeast Asia even closer together.\nAustralia has also invested heavily in developing educational ties with Southeast Asia, and has become a top education destination for many students. What is  lacking, however, is a model to better integrate these students, creating a shared sense of purpose, direction and belonging.\nThis would provide more opportunities for high-potential future leaders to build connections with one another from a young age. As one youth leader told us:\nThere is a chance to build a bridge where Australia can also help us to better figure ourselves out.\nThe ASEAN-Australia Strategic Youth Partnership is already partly fulfilling this appetite for engagement. It has more than 300 members aged 18-29 from Australia and every ASEAN member. The Australia-ASEAN Emerging Leaders Program (or A2ELP, for short) is another organisation geared toward Southeast Asian and Australian social entrepreneurs.\nThey are a great start. We should now build on the fact Australia has a wide constellation of universities, think tanks, community organisations and other stakeholders that are deeply committed to further developing connections between the regions. For instance, a number of universities have already set up campuses in Southeast Asia, such as RMIT University in Vietnam, Monash University in Malaysia and James Cook University in Singapore.\nAnd a growing number are looking to expand specifically in Indonesia, following the lead of Monash in recent years.\nIt's important for graduates to also have greater opportunities to live and work in Australia - and vice versa. Australia's recent moves towards supporting working holiday visas for young Southeast Asians are a good example, as are the New Colombo Plan scholarships, which support Australian undergraduates studying and undertaking internships in the Indo-Pacific region.\nWe should now look for other ways to foster talent mobility between Australia and the ASEAN members. As one emerging leader in Southeast Asia who wants to spend more created_at in Australia explained:\nAustralia is really open, with good work-life balance, and a business culture that brings people together.\nAs Pro Vice-Chancellor at the University of Tasmania, Nicholas Farrelly engages with a wide range of organisations and stakeholders on educational issues, including at the ASEAN-Australia interface. The report discussed here was commissioned and funded by the Australian Mission to ASEAN, a part of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Nicholas has also previously received funding from the Australian Research Council for Southeast Asia-focused work. He is on the board of the Australia-ASEAN Council, which is an Australian government text, and also a director of NAATI, Australia's government-owned accreditation authority for translators and interpreters. These are his personal views, shaped by strong collaboration with his co-authors for this report.\n- ref.

    "text": "\nMar 04, 2024( McCarthy Ttrault Blog: TechLex:  Delivered by Newstex)  \n There is a major battle being waged between the world's democratic countries led by the United States, Germany, France, South Korea, and Japan and the major autocracies led by China and Russia.This battle, called \"Cold War 2.0Artificial Intelligence in the New Battle between China, Russia, and America[1]\" in the new book written by George Takach (published byPegasus Books[2]and distributed bySimon & Schuster[3]), explains the tensions between the democracies and autocracies and provides thoroughly researched insights into the tensions and risks and what the democracies must do to prevail.Cold War 2.0 explains that unlike the first cold war between the Soviet Union and the West that developed after World War II, this war is exemplified by the use of military tech and other coercive strategies by the autocracies against the democracies such as cyber attacks, economic coercion, misinformation and cognitive warfare (to sow divisions and interfere in domestic politics), and intellectual property theft.In Cold war 2.0, the autocracies ignore the rules based international order and, as in the case of Russia's unprovoked and unjust war in Ukraine, and China's threats to take over Taiwan by military force, attack or threaten to attack peaceful democratic neighbors, especially when they perceive the democracies will not band together to oppose them.Cold War 2.0 explains that innovations in the accelerator technologies of artificial intelligence, semi-conductor chips, quantum computing, and biotech are and will be the dual use technologies that give the democracies the industrial and military edge.But, to prevail and leverage their innovative advantages, they must develop and maintain policies to act together to push back against the autocracies, have policies that continue to foster technological innovation, and de-couple and prevent the export of the accelerator technologies to the autocracies.A core theme of Cold War 2.0 is the importance of how the two camps facing off in Cold War 2.0 stack up in terms of technology and innovation.Cold War 2.0 posits that power, whether of the economic, military, or soft form, and geopolitics is derived from the domains of technology and innovation.Cold War 2.0 discusses the drivers and particularly the role of technology and technological innovation and their importance to national prosperity and national security.Cold War 2.0 also posits that the democracies are well ahead of, and will stay ahead of, the autocracies in the transformative technologies of AI, semi-conductors, biotech and quantum computers and other important technologies such cloud computing, software and software services, internet and telecom platforms, space technologies, fusion technology, robotics and military defense.George Takach in Cold War 2.0 notes that the \"essential battle of Cold War 2.0 is the push by the autocrats to topple the rules-based international order, and the ability-and hopefully willingness, resolve, and stamina-of democracies to resist this dangerous effort by the autocracies.\"He explains that \"the rules-based, free and open international order based on international law is in grave crisis, with Russia in Ukraine, Hamas in the Middle East, China openly trying to deny the international order in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, and with authoritarian narratives penetrating some democracies\" Further, that the democracies \"must demonstrate that democracy offers the best model for prosperity, stability, and security.\"Cold War 2.0 also provides insights into the domestic policies of the leading democracies and autocracies.Importantly, it stresses how important international leadership of the United States is to winning Cold War 2.0.It also shows how dangerous the re-election of Donald Trump and the isolationist policies of the Republican Party in the United States are to countering the threats posed by the autocracies of China and Russia.It is precisely because Cold War 2.0 requires the US to play such a linchpin role as the leading democracy in the world that the rise of autocratic and isolationist tendencies in the US are so disconcerting.There is no sugarcoating the immense risk.Donald Trump has said he would withdraw support from Ukraine.This would embolden Putin, cause a crisis of confidence within NATO, and cause shock waves through the foreign ministries in Seoul, Tokyo, and Canberra...In a perfect world, American isolationism is an option.In the wildly imperfect world that actually exists, where autocrats constantly strive to expand their physical and digital spheres of empire and oppression, American isolationism cannot become an option.In the early 1920s, after a terrible World War I, America retreated back to the Western Hemisphere and refused to join the League of Nations, not wanting to get entangled in \"old world\" conflicts anymore.America's departure from the world stage virtually ensured an even bloodier World War II.Thankfully, America decided to help build a world governed by a rules-based international order after World War II.The result (helped along by deterrence afforded by nuclear weapons, to be sure) has been a lasting peace among the great powers since then.It would be absolute folly for the Republican Party to try again the 1920s geopolitical strategy of isolation, especially when the world is in the midst of Cold War 2.0.Americans need to do the right thing on November 5, 2024, not just for the other democracies of the world, but for themselves... \nResponsibility for the immense democracy wrecking ball that is Donald Trump rests not only on Trump's own shoulders, but also on the many enablers within the Republican Party who speak nary a word against this autocrat wannabe while he attempts to break every institution of domestic and global democracy he possibly can.In truth, the greatest battle to date of Cold War 2.0 will not be fought in Ukraine, or in the Taiwan Strait, but at the American ballot box in November 2024.As atechnology lawyer[4]and lawyer interested in policies that promote innovation in AI and other technologies, I found George Takach's insights on the importance of innovation to economic prosperity and security to be refreshing.These are immensely important goals as the democracies are currently grappling with the best policy frameworks to promote ethical and safe innovation without hindering crucial innovation.In the area of AI, the European Union is out in front with the recent agreement on the draftArtificial Intelligence Act(summarized here[5]).The U.K. is taking a pro-innovation decentralized approach, while the Canadian government appears posed to enacta deeply flawed AI regulatory regime[6]law (AIDA[6]) that could well impede Canada's prosperity and national security in one of the most important, strategic and transformative technologies of our created_at.While the focus of Cold War 2.0 is not on the best approach to regulating technologies like AI, because of its critical importance to the prosperity and national security of the democracies, the book counsels taking a \"light\" pro-innovation approach that fosters completive displacement.According to George Takach: \nArtificial intelligence will be central to all the protagonists involved in Cold War 2.0, for the simple reason that it will become a core technology-perhapsthecore technology-of the 21st century.In addition, as an accelerator technology, AI is having and will continue to have enormous impact on a range of other innovation.\"\"...the legislatures of the relevant democracies should have appropriate science and technology subcommittees hold hearings into AI, and specifically the risks posed by it, but even then the urge to regulate AI should be pursued with restraint, given that there is simply insufficient evidence of harm at this point that would warrant a heavy-handed approach to lawmaking.There might be one day, but that day has yet to come.In the meancreated_at, in order to ensure that they prevail against the autocracies in Cold War 2.0, the democracies should not handicap themselves relative to the autocracies by shutting down AI research unilaterally... \n\"Particularly in the Cold War 2.0 world of global rivalry, the democracies cannot afford to hamper competitive displacement in their market for software development, which is the secret sauce of so much of their success.\"\"Moreover, AI should be regulated, but with a light touch that doesn't dampen the tempo and volume of research and development or build a digital moat around today's leading AI behemoths.This will be one of the most consequential legislative interventions in the economy in the history of the United States; Congress and the White House, with the help of the courts, should be prepared to course-correct a few created_ats before they get it right.\"George Takach is well placed to have written this important and thought provoking book.He has a background in international affairs (with an MA from Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, Carleton).He was a prominent technology lawyer with McCarthy Ttrault - my law partner for over 30 years - and perhaps one of the best tech lawyers Canada has ever had.He was also a Professor at Osgoode Hall Law School (adjunct) for over 20 years as well as an author of several books on computer law.Importantly, throughout his illustrious career George Takach could be trusted for his insights and, in my experience, was invariably right on issues.His book Cold War 2.0is meticulously researched and provides many useful insights to help understand the frightening and perilous created_ats we are living in.It provides many suggestions for pushing back and countering the attacks and risks associated with China and Russia.It deserves to be read and debated.Cold War 2.0 should also be required reading for policy makers in governments.This is especially so for government departments in charge of promoting innovation in the accelerator technologies, foreign relations, and national security.As for Canada, it should be read by the officials inInnovation, Science and Economic Development Canada[7](ISED) and theOffice of the Prime Minister[8](PMO) who could benefit from Cold War 2.0's insights and warnings regarding stifling AI innovation such as by an improvidentAI law[9]like AIDA, andGlobal Affairs Canada[10]that manages Canada's diplomatic relations (among other things) andNational Defense - Canada[11](DND).George Takach will be appearing at two book launches this week.The first is atMcCarthy Tetrault[12]on Monday March 4, 2024.The second book launch will be hosted by theMunk School[13]on March 6, 2024.George Takach is an engaging speaker and the topic is a red hot one.You will want to attend.\n\nN"

    "text": "\n[20:00:00]\nWILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Military experts warn the risk of a major global conflict no longer a distant threat, but a looming crisis. Ongoing wars in the Middle East and Ukraine threatening to spill over highly sensitive technology moving at lightning speed.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSENIOR COL. WU QIAN, CHINESE DEFENSE MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON: China pays close attention to security risks posed by military applications of AI technologies.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nRIPLEY (voice over): China's military capabilities expanding at an unprecedented pace, simmering tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea, setting the stage for a catastrophic showdown. As the world teeters on the brink of a new era of warfare, machines making life and death decisions on the battlefield.\nWill Ripley, CNN, Taipei.\n(End VT)\nERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: Thanks for joining us.\nAnderson starts now.\nJOHN KING, CNN HOST: Tonight on 360, a supremely favorable day for Donald Trump. The High Court says he can stay on Colorado's ballot and every other states, too.\nAlso tonight, with most Americans saying Joe Biden's too old to serve four more years, we'll talk to a reporter who spoke at length with the President and he'll detail the Biden he saw.\nAnd later, some rare reporting from inside Haiti where armed gangs rule the streets and civil society is coming apart at the seams.\nGood evening, everyone. Thanks for your created_at. John King sitting in for Anderson tonight.\nWe begin with one certain thing. Donald J. Trump will be on the ballot in all 50 states. The Supreme Court today making it a reality and making history, settling an issue that's been unclear since Reconstruction. All nine justices deciding that neither Colorado nor any other state can bar him under the 14th Amendment Section 3 insurrection language. Quoting from the opinion: \"We conclude that states may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office. But States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency.\"\nThe opinion was per curiam, meaning not attributed to any specific justice. However, in a concurrence that you might say reads more like a dissent, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson take issue with the ruling's broadness, which they suggest is to \"insulate this Court and petitioner from future controversy.\" The petitioner, of course, being Donald Trump.\nAs for him, he praised the ruling, then pivoted to the court's next big decision on presidential immunity.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nDONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you make a decision, you don't want to have your opposing party or opponent or even sometext that just thinks you're wrong, bring a criminal suit against you or any kind of a suit when you leave office. I have that right now at a level that notext's ever seen before. I have rogue prosecutors and I have rogue judges. I have judges that are out of control and it's a very unfair thing for me.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nKING: Keeping them honest, there is, of course, no evidence of rogue prosecutors or judges, no matter how many created_ats he says that there are. Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold also weighing in a bit earlier here on CNN.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJENA GRISWOLD, (D) COLORADO SECRETARY OF STATE: First and foremost, I'm glad that they issued a decision. Colorado voters and American voters all across the country deserve to know whether Donald Trump is qualified or not as we go into Super Tuesday.\nBut in terms of the bigger decision, I'm disappointed. And I also think that the big concern is still there. Donald Trump incited the insurrection. He incited that violent mob onto the Capitol to try to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power. And he has not stopped his attacks on democracy since then.\n(END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Joining us now, the Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, whose state Supreme Court back in December rejected an attempt to keep Donald Trump off the ballot.\nMadam Secretary, grateful for your created_at.\nYou did file an amicus brief with the Supreme Court back in January. You took no position as to how the legal issue should be resolved. But you said, \"For the good of democracy, the Court should resolve them now.\" Are you satisfied with the - today's opinion? You get clarity. Did you get what you wanted?\nJOCELYN BENSON, (D) MICHIGAN SECRETARY OF STATE: Yes, I am. And thanks for having me.\nWe, here in Michigan, and election officials all across the country are fully prepared to do our jobs this year, which is making sure every citizen can vote and that we're administering full, free and fair elections, so that continues. The clarity provided by the court is to affirm what I and the vast majority of my colleagues have also said since the beginning, which is that it's inappropriate for any one state to weigh in and make a decisive position on such a thorny legal issue. It really is best left to the federal government. And the Supreme Court has affirmed that, given us that clarity so that any state or state court still wrestling with the question of how to apply Section 3 of the 14th Amendment now has that clarity to declare Donald Trump's eligibility as a candidate in this election.\n[20:05:01]\nKING: Yet you heard your colleague, your Democratic colleague from Colorado, Secretary of State Jena Griswold, telling Wolf Blitzer earlier tonight while she accepts the court's ruling, she still believes individual states should be able to disqualify a presidential candidate from the ballot if they've deemed that candidate participated in an insurrection. Do you agree with her?\nI've been doing this a long created_at and one of the staples of almost 40 years of doing this is the secretaries of state, the chief elections officials, whether you're a Democrat or Republican from a Midwestern state as you are, the East Coast or the West Coast, most of them get along and focus on the mechanics of running a free and fair election. Is there a disagreement among your colleagues, whether they're Democrats or Republicans, on this question?\nBENSON: Again, I think the vast majority of my colleagues have taken the same position I have, which is that it's inappropriate for a state official to weigh in on this issue. And today, the Supreme Court affirmed that position and said, indeed, in cases like this where the legal and factual issues are not straightforward. The Constitution requires they be determined at the federal level, not at the state level.\nAnd then again, I think on all of this, we have to remember who has the ultimate authority, which is the voters in every state. And that, again, was to me affirmed today by giving voters the opportunity to weigh in on who they should hold politically accountable at the ballot box for the issues at stake in this year's election.\nKING: Did it surprise you or did you view it as smart on the justices' part that they did not directly address the question of whether Donald Trump actually engaged in insurrection on - in and around January 6th?\nBENSON: I was surprised. I was at the oral arguments as well and expected, as I think many of us did, for a lot of the discussion to be focused on the definition of insurrection, the facts in this case. But notably, the court said, look, there are lots of different issues at play, both legal and factual. And the question is really who is the appropriate authority, what is the appropriate forum and when is the appropriate created_at to make these determinations.\nAs a legal scholar and a former law dean, I know you have to determine those who and what and when law - at the same created_at or perhaps before you get to the substance of the case. And so I wasn't surprised at all by even the unanimity or the per curiam aspect of the decision today. And I was grateful because it showed by issuing it today before Super Tuesday, the court is aware of the importance of both clarity and timing in this case. And again, in making sure voters go into this election cycle with the clarity of their power to determine the future of our country in this upcoming election.\nKING: Secretary Benson, grateful for your created_at on this important day. Thank you so much.\nWith me now to continue the conversation, the bestselling Supreme Court biographer, Jeffrey Toobin, our CNN Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig, and Cardozo Law School's Jessica Roth.\nJeff, based on the oral arguments, not a shock. If you listen to the oral arguments, this is where the court seemed to be leaning that day. So we always look for clues, right? Number one, they're unanimous. That's rare. That's rare, especially for this court.\nNumber two, as the former president noted, there's - he noted it in an inaccurate way - but there is the giant question of immunity still looming before the court. Do we get any clues about tomorrow from what we read today?\nJEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: There was a paradox about today at the Supreme Court. They were unanimous, which is in controversial cases unusual in this Supreme Court. However, there were some pissed off justices there. You could just tell from the paper the opinions were written on. The three justices didn't dissent - the three liberals - but they really went after the five for saying that - for giving a road map for how this law should be applied instead of just saying, look, what Colorado was - did was wrong. That's all we should have done.\nThe most interesting opinion was from Amy Coney Barrett, who wrote an opinion agreeing with the three liberals, but saying, can everyone please chill out. Saying can we just - like, we have a controversial election coming up, let's not engage in stridency, as she said it.\nELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: I agree with Jeff. There's some heated rhetoric in the concurrence, meaning the opinion put out by the three liberals. But I think it's important to understand just exactly where the disagreement sits, because it's really not much of a disagreement when you dig into it, okay?\nAll nine agreed unanimously, this is not for the states. The difference is the five in the majority said Congress is in charge of this. And the other four said, well, maybe Congress, but maybe other federal authorities. I'm not even clear what that is. But that's the entire base. It is a sliver of a disagreement, yet it gets blown up into this almost like world war three kind of disagreement, which I think is just - doesn't match with the actual substantive disagreement.\nKING: So as you jump in, let me read a little bit here. This is, I believe, Amy Coney Barrett: \"Writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up. For present purposes, our differences are far less important than our unanimity: All nine Justices agree on the outcome of this case. That is the message Americans should take home.\"\nSo as Jeff said, she's trying - not legal language, but I liked it - chill, everytext. Chill. The question is, though, you're looking at this decision about Colorado.\n[20:10:01]\nDoes it tell us anything, even though she's trying to say we should all get along? But do they give you any clues about how they're going to deal with immunity?\nJESSICA ROTH, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: I think it does, potentially. And I think that Amy Coney Barrett's concurrence was trying to say, this is not such a big deal here, right? We don't need to make such a big fuss about the disagreements here. And I think that the liberal justices were saying, no, no, no, there's actually a lot at stake here.\nOne is that with respect to Trump and disqualification, there's actually a lot of significance to what the majority goes ahead and reaches that they didn't need to hear. They're really foreclosing other avenues of adjudicating through federal courts whether or not Donald Trump engaged in insurrection. And they talk about, for example, sometext who is in some way aggrieved by an action taken by him as an executive officer could bring suit to argue in federal court that he was disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\nSo they're angry that the court is precluding that kind of alternative federal adjudication of his ineligibility. But I also ...\nTOOBIN: But remember when ...\nROTH: I'm just ...\nTOOBIN: I'm sorry, please.\nROTH: On the looming immunity point, there's a sort of methodological question here of should courts go ahead and reach unnecessary questions or should they narrowly decide the case before them. What I read into that disagreement is what they expect could happen in the immunity case. In other words, a narrow decision on immunity might hold there is no immunity for the allegations in this indictment and we don't have to reach anything further.\nBut a broader holding might be under this standard that we're going to set forth here today for the first created_at, a president could be immune from prosecution. And now we're going to send it back to the lower courts to apply that standard to the facts here. And that would lengthen the proceedings on the immunity question such that we would never get to trial before the election.\nTOOBIN: But remember what just happened in the - at the Supreme Court. They just granted certiorari on the immunity case and they put the case on, I would say, a fairly slow schedule, which will not quite but almost guarantee that Donald Trump will not be tried before the election.\nIt is not out of the question that the three liberal justices were pissed off about that and I think some of the language you saw, the anger on what is, as you said, a relatively minor disagreement suggests that the court is as polarized as it usually is even in a unanimous decision.\nKING: And so again, that's what fascinates me as the non-lawyer at the table. The liberals are outnumbered. They know that. It's six to three. They're outnumbered. So when you see Amy Coney Barrett, the last Trump appointee, coming in and saying, let's all try to get along here, the question is, number one, do they take it as genuine, the colleagues, or do they take it as more of a political argument. But you're always watching, Roberts saved Obamacare, where's Roberts going to be, that's what everyone always asks first.\nBut what about the Trump justices? Are we learning anything about her? Is she trying to be more Sandra Day O'Connor or can you figure that out?\nHONIG: I feel like it's not going to get better in terms of how they're all getting along. I mean, it's just hard math. It's six three. And if you're on the liberal side and you want to win, you need to flip to you need Roberts plus one and I - we haven't seen that. Well, we've seen it happening in some cases, but none of the big political cases.\nAnd immunity, I really think could be a defining moment here. And I think Jessica's right. I think we need to watch out for the possibility that they don't even decide it, that they send it back down to the trial court, which will completely end any chance of trying it before the election.\nTOOBIN: That is, if they do that ...\nHONIG: Yes.\nTOOBIN: ... is the biggest gift they could give Donald Trump. Let's be clear about that. That anything other than a clear victory for Jack Smith in the Department of Justice is a victory for Donald Trump, even if they say there's no absolute immunity, as Trump is asking for.\nKING: Clarity. You want clarity.\nTOOBIN: I just want to follow the news.\nKING: Jeff Toobin, Elie Honig, Jessica Roth, thank you for your created_at tonight.\nSome of the former president's griping that you heard at the top of the program about what he calls rogue judges may have been about his two New York cases, the civil fraud case he lost and the upcoming criminal trial later this month. There were new developments connected to both today through The Trump Organization's former top finance guy, Allen Weisselberg, and his former attorney, Michael Cohen.\nCNN's Kara Scannell has been following all of those developments and joins us now.\nKara, what did we learn today?\nKARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Allen Weisselberg, a longcreated_at confidant of Donald Trump, pleaded guilty to two felony counts of perjury. This all relates to testimony he gave during the New York attorney general's civil fraud investigation into The Trump Organization and when he testified at the trial last year. His false statements relate to testimony about the size of Trump's triplex apartment at Trump Tower. It had been valued for years on the company's financial statements as though it was 30,000 square feet. In reality, it was just under 11,000 square feet.\nOne of the statements that Weisselberg admitted today being false was he was asked at the trial and in his deposition whether he had been present when Donald Trump talked about the size of the apartment. He said he hadn't. In reality, he had been. He was present when Trump was talking to reporters from Forbes magazine about that.\nSo Weisselberg, under this deal, will serve about five months at Rikers Island. This will be his second trip there because he already served a hundred days when he pled guilty in 2022 to 15 counts of tax fraud.\n[20:15:03]\nNow, importantly, though, as part of this deal, despite pressure from the DA's office, Weisselberg is not cooperating against Donald Trump. So he will not be testifying at the trial later this month involving those hush money payments, despite being at the center of it, both with knowledge of Michael Cohen advancing the payment to Stormy Daniels and then the reimbursement of that money to Cohen, John?\nKING: And as that plays out, the former president's legal team is again going after the Manhattan DA, Alvin Bragg. What is that about? What do they say? SCANNELL: Yes. I mean, this has been a constant point of scrutiny that they've been putting on Bragg, saying that this is prosecutorial misconduct, saying that he's essentially picking on Allen Weisselberg, but not looking at the testimony that Michael Cohen had given both at the trial, that same trial, and in other court hearings saying that he should be prosecuted.\nThis has come up before. Prosecutors have said that that is fair game for cross examination by Trump's attorneys at the trial, and that trial, that jury selection, is expected to begin three weeks from today, John?\nKING: Three weeks from today. Kara Scannell, appreciate those important updates.\nUp next, now that the Supreme Court has taken the ballot access off the table, we'll look closer at the campaign itself, some troubling new polling for the incumbent president, and how tomorrow's Super Tuesday primaries could come close to clinching the delegate math for Donald Trump.\nAnd later, you don't want to miss this, our David Culver inside Haiti, torn by gang violence and now under a state of emergency.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n[20:20:20]\nKING: The big Supreme Court ruling today, Super Tuesday is tomorrow, the State of the Union address Thursday night. Yes, it's the first week of March, early in the primary season, but the path of those primaries so far, plus some new polling over the weekend and into this new week, are turning the conversation already more and more to the likelihood of a Biden-Trump fall rematch. Let's look at where we are and then some of the numbers.\nNumber one, some contests over the weekend as well, now have the former president, 247 delegates. Takes 1,200 plus, 1,215 to win, but he is on a path right there. You see the light gray states? Those are all the Super Tuesday states tomorrow. A lot more primaries. Donald Trump can't mathematically clinch tomorrow, but he can get really close by the end of tomorrow night if he continues his big run.\nThe Democrats also are voting. Let me just bring this up here and show this as well to bring up the Democratic side of this in Super Tuesday, we'll flip it over here to the primaries like this. President Biden, 206, two uncommitted delegates so far. He is also on a path to re- nomination, and will get very close tomorrow night as all those delegates come in, which brings in now, where are we?\nAssuming Trump and Biden continue their path to the nomination, where are we? This is our CNN poll of polls. Forgive me for turning my back. I just want to bring this up a little larger, 48 percent for Trump, 46 percent for Biden. That is no clear leader. If you look at some of the late individual polls that go into this average, Trump has been running a little bit stronger, but if you average them all together, which is the smart thing to do, don't overinvest in any one poll. No clear leader, but Trump has clearly been gaining a little bit of steam as we go forward. Why is he gaining steam?\nWell, these are the numbers that are troubling for the President. Here's one from The New York created_ats-Siena College poll, is President Biden too old to be an effective president? Among all voters, 73 percent say yes, 25 percent say no. Here's the troubling part. Even in his own party, the President needs big Democratic turnout in the fall. More than half, 56 percent of Democrats say they think he's too old to be an effective president, 43 percent say no. So that is one challenge for the President as he runs out the primary season, as he gives that big speech Thursday night - address that.\nThe problems are deeper for the President. Again, he is the incumbent president, 24 percent of Americans say the country's on the right track. Two-thirds say it is not, 65 percent say the country is on the wrong track as the President prepares to deliver his State of the Union address.\nOne more, incumbents are often judged by their approval rating. You start to get eight months out from an election, that's a problem. That's a problem. That's the number the President has to change, 36 percent approve of his performance right now in office, 61 percent disapprove. That means a lot of Democrats. If 61 percent disapprove, that means Democrats as well.\nSo let's have a conversation about where we are in the primary calendar, State of the Union and beyond. Let's bring in our CNN Political Commentators Van Jones and Margaret Hoover. Also joining us, the former Democratic presidential candidate, Democratic National Committee chairman and the governor of Vermont, Howard Dean.\nGovernor, I want to start with you. You know what it's like to give a state address, you know the President's weaknesses and you understand campaigns, what does the President - if you could tell the President to do one thing right now, whether it's address the age issue or the wrong track issue, what would you do?\nHOWARD DEAN, (D) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I joke about the age issue when I talk about his unbelievable record. This is a guy who's got the strongest domestic policy record since Lyndon Johnson. And ironically, most of the jobs he's created are going to the very states in the rural states that vote against him, which is insane to me.\nI think he just has to do a very good job and give a very good speech, and he's more than capable of doing that.\nKING: So Van, let's follow up on the governor. If you look deeply into The New York created_ats-Siena College poll, here's one of the things, you look at politicians, what am I getting here, right? We live in a transactional world, right? So 40 percent of registered voters said Trump's policies help them personally. Only 18 percent say Biden's policies help them personally. Gov. Dean just said he's got the greatest record since Lyndon Johnson, why the disconnect?\nVAN JONES, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Very simple, those COVID checks. People remember that I actually got some money directly and so that becomes a part of people's memory. And also, people forgot a whole bunch of the bad things that happened during the Trump years, because COVID was difficult and inflation was difficult. Now that's starting to heal, but people still have that memory of those COVID checks.\nLook, I think Biden has an important job to do, not only to talk about his great record, as the governor said, but what he's going to do going forward. The prices are coming down on everything but food and housing. So he's got to show he's willing to fight on the food price. He's got to fight the grocers, tell them to quit gouging the American people at the cash register. He's got to push on the Fed to get these housing prices down, to get the interest rates down. He's got to show he's going to be fighting for what ordinary people are dealing with every day, and then he can get back in this fight.\nKING: Well, when we count the votes tomorrow night, Trump can't clinch, but he can get really close. Yet, if you look at some of the past states, so it's the glass three-quarters full or one-quarter empty, I guess.\n[20:25:01]\nI would ask you if Nikki Haley keeps getting 20 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent, is that what you're looking for? Can the - is the President addressing his weaknesses? Is the former president addressing his weaknesses?\nMARGARET HOOVER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, Nikki Haley keeps addressing Donald Trump's weaknesses, much to his own chagrin. And look, she's clearly made some kind of a calculation with her campaign about what staying competitive means, both to her internally and then to her donors. Because frankly, this is literally a question of whether that staying competitive question is salient for the people who continue to fund the campaign to go beyond Super Tuesday, to the next round of states and beyond and beyond, and how far, how much does she have to win tomorrow in order for them to continue to fund this effort that, while I'm fully supportive of the Republican alternative to Donald Trump, has always felt somewhat implausible and has always rested on some kind of strategy that wasn't clear beyond a hope and a prayer.\nKING: Well, she's back in South Carolina tomorrow. The expectation is if she doesn't win - have a surprise and win a couple states that she will say enough, is that your expectation?\nHOOVER: That is not my hope and I'm living on a hope and a prayer, but that may be what happens.\nKING: Gov. Dean, you're a grassroots guy. You like to go out and work the streets. You like to organize and get things going, so I want your perspective. You talked about and joke about the age, talked about your accomplishments. I've been traveling a lot, and I think you have a point about some of the policies. But the thing that strikes me is the visibility issue. A lot of people think, where is the President? Why hasn't he been out more? You're still in touch with people around the country who - as you - when you're organizing days, both as a candidate at the DNC, how much of it is that, that people want to see an energetic president in their state, in their community or how much of it is he just needs to better explain what he got the Congress to pass a couple of years ago?\nDEAN: This is the frustrating part. This is where I'll redux to blame the media. The media is fascinated with Donald Trump. They created Donald Trump, and they can't stay away from him because they want the clicks, no matter what the clicks and this is - I'm not just talking about television. I'm talking about the New York created_ats. Look at their coverage of Trump, it's an outrage every day and his people love it.\nThe truth is, Biden has been all over the place, and he just doesn't get the same coverage because he's not a charlatan, and an entertainer, and a crook and all the things that people like to write about. And the - it's just - it is really, really frustrating. And the other part, of course, is on social media, there's no editors, so the more clicks, the more coverage, and it doesn't matter what the clicks are about. So that's the frustrating part about this.\nBiden's a quality guy, and he's performed very, very well. He's not getting the credit for it because Trump understands entertainment and Biden doesn't, and the media falls for it every created_at, and so do the American people. There's a lot of Americans out there who have no idea what Biden has accomplished, and they have a lot of ideas about Trump, most of which are wrong.\nKING: Do you agree with that? You're also an organizer guy. I've talked to you when I've come back to some of my trips and go door- knocking in Milwaukee, and you have a 70-something-year-old black woman say, I may not vote ...\nJONES: Yes. I think ...\nKING: ... because I don't think it matters anymore, who specifically asked where's the President.\nJONES: Yes, look, I see it a little bit different from the governor in that. First of all, this Gaza thing is weighing him down. There's a part of that - those numbers that you see are young people especially, they're just dismayed by what they're seeing in Gaza. That's real. I also think he hasn't done as many interviews. Certainly, the governor's correct that he's been out there more than he gets credit for, but he's done fewer interviews than you would expect for a president and I think those things hurt him.\nI think he can turn around. I think right now a lot of Democrats are in denial that he's even going to be our nominee, but once I think it's clear that he is, they're going to go from being in denial to being determined that Trump not win. But right now this is real and I think you've got to deal with it.\nSo if the incumbent president, President Biden, has to deal with, try to bring younger voters back, try to get the base rallied up, another big target would obviously be anytext voted for Nikki Haley in the primary. Is that what you would do if you were working the Biden campaign?\nHOOVER: Absolutely.\nKING: Take all your money and resources and say, okay, 40 percent of them are not going to vote for Joe Biden, but if you can get - if in a state like New Hampshire or a state like Pennsylvania, you can give three or four percent of them, bingo.\nHOOVER: Especially if you're running on democracy and defending democracy, don't you want the broadest possible coalition of voters to join with you, and that's disaffected Republicans, of which there's at least a good 25 percent, perhaps a third. By the way, and that's just the primaries, wait until we get to - I mean, the Governor respectfully says we've been spending a lot of created_at on Donald Trump. Will you just wait until this is a - really a two-candidate race. I think the scrutiny will come with Donald Trump in an all-new way that actually will probably play unfavorably for Donald Trump.\nI will just say one more thing. This Siena poll shows that unquestionably the Republican Party is not picking a winner if they pick Donald Trump, because it is fundamentally clear that if Nikki Haley were the Republican candidate, she would be able to beat Donald Trump or whoever the Democratic candidate were.\nKING: And you also see and I'll give the Governor this point, that the - we focus - he's the incoming president, so we focus more on the bad numbers for him. There's some bad numbers for Donald Trump in that poll as well. You're absolutely right about that.\nVan Jones, Margaret Hoover, Gov. Dean, appreciate your created_at tonight.\nComing up, we'll continue this conversation and dive into an extended newly released interview President Biden granted to New Yorker. The reporter Evan Osnos joins us to explain why the President believes only he can beat Donald Trump.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n[20:34:17]\nKING: President Biden says he's about to prove all the snarky pundits and all the Democratic hand wringers wrong, again. In an interview with the New Yorker, the president takes a defiant tone, and says he is in the 2024 race because he believes he is best positioned to beat the former president, Donald Trump.\nBiden spoke with reporter Evan Osnos, who's written a biography of the 46th president. That interview taking place in mid-January. The article, \"Joe Biden's Last Campaign,\" is a wide-ranging interview that also covers the president's opinions on the economy, Israel, and Ukraine, and more.\nThis is how Osnos describes their conversation about the November election and concerns among Democrats about Biden's viability. Quote, \"Given the doubts, I asked, wasn't it a risk to say I'm the one to do it? He shook his head and said, 'No. I'm the only one who has ever beat him. And I'll beat him again.' For Biden, the offense of the contested election was clearly personal.\"\n[20:35:09]\nJoining me now Evan Osnos. In addition to that biography of the president, his latest book is on the deep divisions here in the United States is titled, \"Wildland: The Making of America's Fury.\" Evan, grateful for your created_at. I want to get to some of the specifics in a minute. But not everytext gets to spend a lot of created_at with the president around the Oval Office.\nSo you had that unique access. You also spent a lot of created_at with him over the years. And then you're back with him after not seeing him for a while for something like this. What just jumped out at you being in the presence of him? How is he different physically? How is he different temperamentally? And how pumped was he on this question of he says I can beat him again?\nEVAN OSNOS, STAFF WRITER, THE NEW YORKER: You know what struck me, John? One of the first things he did when I got there to the Oval Office was he said, let me show you where Donald Trump sat and watched the revolution. That was his term to describe the events of January 6th.\nHe walked me over to the Oval Office dining room, which is back in the private chambers there, which, of course, is where the select committee says that Donald Trump spent that afternoon. What I -- the reason I mentioned that is one of the first things he did was he wanted in his own way. He was thinking about Donald Trump.\nYou cannot talk about Joe Biden right now and his state of mind without thinking about Trump. Look, on a physical level, he is slower and his movements and his gestures. No question about it. His mind seemed unchanged to me. He didn't bungle a date or a name or anything like that.\nI was looking to see any signs of that. What struck me most of all, John, was that he was in a defiant state of mind. He is, in some ways, he's looking to make a case for himself now.\nKING: So the point you made is actually instructive if you read the entire article, and I urge people to in detail. You don't just interview the president. You have a wide-ranging conversation with democratic strategists and other experts around there.\nYou talk about the first thing he did to show you where Donald Trump watched January 6th. So they believe democracy -- Trump and democracy, Trump and democracy, Trump and democracy. That's what they believe inside the White House.\nYour article went to print before this latest New York created_ats/Siena poll, but you've seen the polling. You know, the president's job performance is way underwater. Views on the economy, right track, wrong track, are very bad for an incumbent president. So how does what he says square with those numbers? Or does he just think they're not real? OSNOS: On some level, there is a lot of suspicion in the White House about polling. I think there is a feeling that over the last few years, even going back to 2016 that polls have shown themselves to be unreliable, partly in the age of the cell phone. Look, it tends to be that candidates who are not leading in the polls tend to question the polls.\nThere is more specificity to their concerns. Jen O'Malley Dillon, who is an influential aid around the president working for the campaign. She says, we don't believe that these favorability polls line up exactly with what people actually do in the ballot box.\nLook, that's a controversial statement, John. You know, some Democrats will disagree with that. Some will agree with it. What's interesting is that that's what they believe. If you're trying to understand their strategy, that's one of the insights that gives you a feel for why they are not more ruffled than other Democrats may be.\nKING: Over the years, he has bristled and his team has bristled at the idea that, you know, Joe Biden's not a presidential contender. And, you know, he did lose twice, but then he won. So when they hear a lot of this, they call it bedwetting, they call it people who don't understand them and their team.\nI want to focus on the president specifically, because it's very rare for sometext to get extended created_at as you did with the president. He's aware of what people are saying about him. What did he tell you?\nOSNOS: You know, interestingly, John, there's a kind of deep-seated element of Joe Biden that runs all the way back to his childhood, which is that he feels like he has always been out to try to prove the doubters wrong. You know, we somecreated_ats talk about his stutter.\nYou cannot understand this guy without understanding how much that is an imprint on everything he does in politics, even today at the age of 81. That he is alert to the sense that he has defied the predictions more than once and more recently defied them in 2020 -- or defied them in '22, I should say, in the midterms when Democrats outperformed, defied them in '23.\nAnd there's an edge to him, John. Honestly, that was one of the things that really struck me. He is, over the years, there was a kind of a jolly quality about Joe Biden. There were moments of that still there, but there is a sense of conviction that he's doing something that is very personal for him.\nYou know, this is partly -- we somecreated_ats say that Donald Trump stole the election. Well, he stole it from Donald --from Joe Biden, I should say. I mean, that is really on some level, one of the elements that is going on in the background. And Joe Biden is not sometext who wants to be pushed aside. That is a very clear feeling and it is very present in his conversation.\nKING: You mentioned January 6th and the president using the term revolution. What are presidents -- how did he articulate his biggest concerns and the case he wants to make against Trump? OSNOS: Yes. I have to tell you, one thing that was very striking to me was he said, I am prepared for the fact that this man is going to contest this result. He said, losers who lose are never grateful -- are never graceful when they're losing. That is a big idea.\n[20:40:02]\nMeaning that he is prepared for the idea that we could have sometext contesting the election in '24 as we did in 20 -- I think it's worth pausing. I'm just considering the full implications of that. He's going to be making this case to Americans over the course of the next several months.\nThere is a deep feeling among his advisers that the offense of January 6th, that on some level, it is still something that deeply collides with our sense of what it means to be in American politics, that we don't do violence in politics. And that he thinks that as we get closer to Election Day, that idea will take on greater and greater salience, significance in people's minds.\nThat's a political bet. It's a part of a message, and it's revealing to us to know that that's one of the things that they believe is significant.\nKING: Evan Osnos, I appreciate it. It's a fascinating interview and a greater, broader piece there. Nice to keep that as you watch the next several months play out. We'll see if the baseline the president lays out. So stands the test of created_at.\nEvan, thanks for your created_at tonight.\nJust ahead for us, inside the gang violence that is now consuming Haiti, which just declared a state of emergency. CNN's David Culver, who's been on the ground there, joins us next.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n[20:45:17]\nKING: The State Department told CNN today that the U.S. Embassy in Haiti remains open a day after a state of emergency was declared. That state of emergency declared when thousands of inmates escape from Haiti's largest prison.\nMeancreated_at, protesters have demanded the ouster of the Prime Minister, Ariel Henry, who reneged on elections in the wake of the president's assassination more than two and a half years ago. The Prime Minister's whereabouts are uncertain.\nCNN's David Culver is just back from Haiti and has this harrowing report.\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\nDAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So we're like a block away? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes\nCULVER (voice-over): It's as close as we can get driving. So, we layer up and walk.\nCULVER Oh yes. You can already smell it. Wow. Look at people just still making their commute as tires are burning right in the middle of the street here.\nCULVER (voice-over): No police barricade, no firefighters, most seemingly unfazed. These flames have been burning for several hours. Haiti has been engulfed in turmoil for years.\nCULVER: We don't have a home to live and we don't have food to eat. That's what they're shouting.\nCULVER (voice-over): Many here now fear their country is on the brink of exploding.\nCULVER: Does it feel safe right now?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no, no.\nCULVER: It doesn't.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, it doesn't. It doesn't. It doesn't seem. My country is broken right now.\nCULVER (voice-over): These folks blame the current government and Prime Minister Ariel Henry, appointed following the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021. They want Henry to go, but he says he is not yet ready to step down.\nThis as panicked street shootouts like this one have become a near daily occurrence. It's often a clash between police and the gangs which have essentially taken Haiti hostage. They flaunt their weapons and wealth on TikTok, threatening police and basking in lawlessness. Many residents now living behind barricades.\nCULVER: This is not the gangs doing this. This is the folks that live in these neighborhoods who are putting these up to prevent gangs from coming in and kidnapping.\nCULVER (voice-over): Using whatever might stop or slow the kidnappers, efforts to protect families and preserve innocence. That innocence shattered for others. This 14-year-old says he was recruited by a gang at 11. He tells me he is often forced to burn the bodies of those killed by other gang members.\nI want to change my way of life, he says, with a heavy look of shame.\nAt an early morning food distribution, we meet dozens of women who have felt the wrath of gang violence. At created_ats, we noticed a loss stare in their eyes.\nCULVER: All of them had been victims. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All of them.\nCULVER: So, there is notext here who has not been affected.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\nCULVER (voice-over): This woman's sister shot and killed. This one's husband burned alive inside their homes. This woman tells us she was raped. She shows us the marks left behind.\nIn recent months, gangs have seized more and more control over this country, including the roads leading to Port-au-Prince. Officials estimate that gangs now control as much as 80 percent of the capital. Even the U.S. Embassy and international airport are mostly surrounded by rival gang territories.\nIt's led the Haitian National Police to create an undercover unit. We go with him to the frontlines.\nCAITLIN HU, CNN SENIOR EDITOR: This unit actually goes into gang areas, looks for gang members, and fights them.\nCULVER (voice-over): The officers ask us not to reveal our exact location. And they tell us to work quickly, given we're standing exposed on a windy hillside.\nCULVER: As police have described it to me, basically everything behind me is occupied by the gangs. It's under their control. There are homes all around us. We're standing on the foundation of one home that had been abandoned.\nCULVER (voice-over): They offered to drive us closer.\nHU: And you can see they're getting ready.\nCULVER: Yes, our drivers, all geared up now, ready for a potential gunfire to come our way. Stay away from the windows as we come in here. They describe this as the last defensive point, and beyond here is what they consider to be their frontlines.\nCULVER (voice-over): From here, you can see the battlefield. No signs of any suspected gang members for now. Police are not the only ones trying to gain the upper hand here. In a fractured state, alternatives to the gangs and government surface.\nWe're headed to meet a commander of BSAP, Haiti's armed environmental protection agency that has splintered from the Henry government, challenging its legitimacy. We pull up to a gated compound.\nThe man in the purple shirt leads us in. He then changes into his BSAP uniform. It's the commander. He is in hiding from police. His message echoes the anti-government protester.\n[20:50:00]\nHe flexes BSAP's strength in numbers and its potential to help bring stability. But, when it comes to his own family --\nCULVER: You mentioned you have four kids. What do you think their future is in this country?\nCULVER (voice-over): He fears their future is best served leaving Haiti.\nThe desperation is felt beyond Port-au-Prince. In places like Jeremie, the U.N. chopper is the safest way to get there. It's about an hour ride. Members of the World Food Programme take us through this rural coastal community devastated by recent protests.\nJEAN-MARTIN BAUER, WFP HAITI DIRECTOR: Right back there, you had five people who were killed last week.\nCULVER: Right there?\nBAUER: It was right there. Yes.\nCULVER (voice-over): We arrived at this agricultural consortium. The WFP buys food from these local farmers to then hand out. But the recent protests have blocked distribution efforts, leaving some food to spoil. It's frustrating for the WFP officials, as they know, you don't have to look far to find hunger here. These farmers pointing to their stomachs, lifting their shirts to us.\nCULVER: You're hungry?\nBAUER: A lot of folks will look at Haiti and they'll say it's having issues for so long.\nCULVER: The question that no doubt people in the U.S. will ask is, well, why should we help?\nBAUER: Well, there are two reasons why you need to help. First of all, they're on humanitarian grounds. But then there is also wrong self- interest in the U.S. So, the longer you wait to act on Haiti, the more migrants there will be on our southern border. It's that simple.\nCULVER (voice-over): Many here search for normalcy where they can, even with the threat of violence, missing mass for some is not an option. They wear their Sunday best and unite in prayer. Places of worship are not immune from gang terror. They at least offer a moment of tranquility and hope for now.\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\nKING: David Culver, joining us now. Sad, sad, but fascinating reporting, David. How do Haitians feel about the question of international intervention? And is it clear what form that might could take in the short term?\nCULVER (on-camera): So in the immediacy, John, it's likely to look like 1,000 Kenyan police officers that would be deployed any day now to Haiti. And we know late last week, Prime Minister Ariel Henry was in Kenya and he signed that agreement. But that is part of what fueled this most recent outbreak. It has seen this surge in violence really get out of control.\nThe folks on the ground that we spoke with, they don't want a foreign force there. In fact, a lot of them would come up to us angry that the U.S., Canada, France are supporting these multinational security forces with finances. They're not contributing troops, but they say even contributing the funding is something that they don't want to see.\nInstead, they hope to have the stability through elections. The question, John, is how do you create that stable climate without eradicating the gangs? And then how do you eradicate the gangs without bringing in the forces to do that? It remains unknown, and until now it looks like Haiti, like that gentleman said, will be a broken state.\nAnd it's the folks on the ground, the people there, that are paying the price.\nKING: Paying the price, every single day. David Culver, appreciate that fascinating reporting.\nUp next for us, some breaking news. Email and text messages reveal the new details on the scope of the fake electors plot and how it continued, yes, even after January 6th.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n[20:57:49]\nKING: Some breaking news now, text messages and emails made public as part of a lawsuit show that Kenneth Chesebro, the attorney who helped come up with the Trump campaign's fake electors plot, kept proposing ways to overturn the 2020 election. Yes, even after the January 6th Capitol attack.\nCNN's Zach Cohen joins us with the details. Zach, so what was Kenneth Chesebro up to after, after January 6th?\nZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, John, we've known that Ken Chesebro is qualified as the architect of the fake electors plot in the lead up to January 6th. But we're now learning that he continued to beat that drum after the violence at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th.\nAnd I want to read this text message from him to -- that he sent to another Trump lawyer from Wisconsin two days after the U.S. Capitol riot. He says, \"The events of the last two days open up legal options in the states for winning rulings favorable to Trump.\" He then goes on to say that maybe they can revisit some of the past petitions that they were trying to use to overturn the 2020 election in Trump's favor.\nHe then pitches a variety of different ideas. Ideas that would have gotten other people in legal hot water. And this runs counter to what he's told state prosecutors. He's interviewed in almost a dozen states now about his role in the fake electors plot. And he essentially described himself as sometext just trying to give legal advice to Donald Trump and to the White House as they sought to legally challenge the outcome. We now know he was way more intimately involved and not just in the lead up of January 6, but in the days afterwards.\nKING: And so what else was revealed in these text messages and emails say about Chesebro's actions and whereabouts on January 6th?\nCOHEN: Yes, John, I mean, of all the people that Jack Smith, the special counsel, has identified as Trump's co-conspirators in trying to overturn the 2020 election, Chesebro might be the only one who actually showed up to the U.S. Capitol on January 6th. These text messages include selfies, where he took selfies with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones at the U.S. Capitol on the same day that the riot happened.\nAnd look, he even bragged at one point about being able to whiff tear gas that was fired at protesters in the U.S. Capitol in the day, kind of highlighting his proximity to the action that was going on. So it really does call into question again.\nChesebro's description of himself as just a lawyer trying to give legal advice to a president trying to challenge the outcome and maybe more as an activist and sometext who was really trying to push his own desires and his own agenda through his role as a lawyer.\nKING: And what legal jeopardy does just that lawyer face right now, Zach?\nCOHEN: We know Chesebro has already pled guilty in Georgia where the, you know, Fani Willis, the D.A. there is investigating efforts to overturn the election results. He's an unindicted co-conspirator in Jack Smith's indictment of Donald Trump.\nI'm told that the feds, the federal investigators have not reached back out to Chesebro since he informed them he was going to take a plea deal in Georgia. He's interviewed with, again, about five different state prosecutors in his created_at since taking a plea deal. So we're going to have to see, but lying to state prosecutors or not being fully truthful with state prosecutors can be a problem.\nLearning more all the created_at. Zach Cohen, really appreciate it. Thanks so much.\nThe news continues. The Source with Kaitlan Collins starts now.\n"

    "title": "The bacterial microbiome of symbiotic and menthol-bleached polyps of Galaxea fascicularis in captivity",
    "created_at": "2024-02-13",
    "text": "\n2024 FEB 13 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Life Science Daily -- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from biorxiv.org:\n “Coral reefs support the livelihood of half a billion people but are at high risk of collapse due to the vulnerability of corals to climate change and local anthropogenic stressors.\n “While understanding coral functioning is essential to guide conservation efforts, research is challenged by the complex nature of corals. They exist as metaorganisms (holobionts), constituted by the association between the (coral) animal host, its obligate endosymbiotic algae (Symbiodiniaceae), and other microorganisms comprising bacteria, viruses, archaea, fungi and other protists. Researchers therefore increasingly turn to model organisms to unravel holobiont complexity, dynamics, and how these determine the health and fitness of corals. The coral Galaxea fascicularis is an emerging model organism for coral symbiosis research with demonstrated suitability to aquarium rearing and reproduction, and to manipulation of the host-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis.\n “However, little is known about the G. fascicularis microbiome after long-term captivity and how it responds to menthol bleaching--the experimental removal of the Symbiodiniaceae which represents the first step in coral-algal symbiosis manipulation. For this, we characterized the bacterial microbiome of symbiotic and menthol-bleached G. fascicularis originating from the Red Sea and South China Sea (Hong Kong) that were long-term aquarium-reared in separate facilities.\n “We found that captive corals hosted a relatively simple microbiome composed of relatively few bacterial taxa, when compared to reports of the microbiome of corals in the wild. Symbiotic polyps (clonal replicates) from the same colony had similar microbiomes, which were distinct from those of other colonies despite co-culturing in shared aquaria. The response of the bacterial microbiome to menthol bleaching varied between the two facilities, warranting further investigation into the role of rearing conditions. Nevertheless, the changes in community composition observed in both instances appeared to be stochastic, and indicative of a dysbiotic state. Considering the importance of captivity and bleaching treatments for coral symbiosis research, our results--although preliminary--contribute fundamental knowledge for the development of the Galaxea coral model for symbiosis research.”\n This preprint has not been peer-reviewed.\n For more information on this research see: biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.23.554380v2\n Keywords for this news article include: Cyclohexanols, Menthol, Microbiology, Monoterpenes. \n Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world.

    "created_at": "2024-02-13",
    "text": "\nThe world is likely facing a more “dangerous decade” as military spending rises and tensions soar across the globe, according to a new report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).\nResearchers said the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza indicate that military powers could evoke a “might is right approach” to pursue claims, which will lead to increased defense ties from democracies.\n“Moscow’s military actions have amplified concerns in other parts of the world, particularly the Indo-Pacific, that a militarily powerful neighbor may try to exert its will over others,” they wrote.\nThis also comes as “governments are trying to balance appetite for advanced weapons with the need to rebuild industrial-scale ammunition production capacity,” they said.\nAnd it comes amid the collapse of major accords such as the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, which limited conventional military equipment in Europe. Russia withdrew from the treaty last year, prompting the western security alliance NATO to suspend participation.\nIISS researchers said democratic governments are working quickly to adapt to a changing security environment.\n“National security is no longer an afterthought and … looming challenges require serious attention,” they said.\nThe report, called The Military Balance 2024, is part of an annual IISS assessment of security threats and military action and buildup across the globe. \nThis year’s assessment calls attention to not just Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas, but also China’s threats against Taiwan and in the South China Sea against the Philippines.\n“China is becoming more assertive, not just in its immediate vicinity,” they said. “The country flew a high-altitude surveillance balloon over the US and deployed ships near American shores, while its maricreated_at assets had tense encounters with Canadian and Philippine vessels.”\nThe report also identified concerns with North Korean aggression against South Korea, military coups in Africa. It noted the less secure environment is leading to a major reassessment of defense equipment priorities, such as increased investment in artillery or advanced weaponry like drones.\nResearchers also found that defense spending was up last year, rising 9 percent across the globe to $2.2 trillion.\nThat boost was largely triggered by NATO, which increased spending by 32 percent last year, with 10 European nations reaching the two percent of economic output goal for the alliance.\nAbout 70 percent of global military spending is from NATO, China, Russia and India, according to the report.\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.\n"

    "title": "'Assertive transparency' now PHL's weapon of choice in row with China",
    "created_at": "2024-02-13",
    "text": "\n Security experts urged the government Tuesday to institutionalize 'assertive transparency' because it has been proven effective in countering China's escalating misinformation and malign activities in the West Philippine Sea (WPS).\nThe experts made the statement during a forum that tackled disinformation in the WPS organized by the Stratbase Institute.\nRetired United States Col. Raymond Powell, founder of security think tank Project Sealight emphasized, 'The importance of institutionalizing transparency-to write it down and disseminate so that everytext will fully understand it.'\n'Maximum transparency brings maximum accountability...if you turn on the lights in the grey zone, all of sudden the 'cockroaches' scatter,' Powell said.\nDr. Benjamin Goirigolzarri, Ph.D., Team Member of Project Myoushu, Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation said, 'Committing to the use of free press offered a really compelling narrative in the face of Chinese misinformation. So, now, Philippine vessels are armed with journalists ready to document run-ins with the Chinese militia to put on display to the world the bullying that Chinese are doing in the South China Sea [SCS].'\n'Assertive transparency shifts the calculus on grey zone aggression. It has the impression of imposing a really steep international reputational cost to the bad actors,' Goirigolzarri said.\nIn a paper published by Stratbase Institute, Powell and Gorigolzarri comprehensively analyzed the government's assertive transparency initiative, which involves 'seeking out and exposing Chinese maricreated_at aggression for the world to see.'\nThey noted that the transparency initiative 'enables ordinary citizens to viscerally experience the full measure of gray zone aggression, which gives the government increased political latitude to take the hard steps required to push back.'\nCommodore Jay Tarriela, Philippine Coast Guard Adviser of the Commandant for Maricreated_at Security, said, 'our efforts to publicize compelling videos and images that truthfully document Chinese illegal actions in the West Philippine Sea, have garnered international attention and condemnation. More countries are now expressing their criticism and standing in solidarity with Manila against Beijing's bullying behavior and blatant disregard for international law.'\nTarriela pointed out that Beijing utilizes social media platforms and rely on their trolls to spread fake news and disinformation to support their false narrative. In the cyber-information space, Tarriela said, 'they aim to sow discord, disunity and confusion among the Filipino people.'\n'Our transparency initiative is strategic because it does not require us to just be assertive in telling the truth or to withhold the portion of truth in order to be measured. Instead, it is strategic because it is designed to achieve a grand objective in pursuit of our national security and interest,' Tarriela said.\nStratbase Institute President Victor Andres Manhit said the Philippines' assertive transparency campaign helps reaffirm the country's rightful place within its own territory.\n'China's persistent claims over the West Philippine Sea remain inconsequential in altering the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Their aggressive actions will not grant them the support of the international community. Their swarming and blocking tactics, excessive island-building, destruction of the marine environment, and water cannon tactics cannot overturn the established and well-respected international law,' Manhit said.\n"

    "text": "\nThe global defence spending has skyrocketed over the past 12 months \nFigures published on Tuesday by the International Institute for Strategic Studies show that global defence spending has skyrocketed over the past 12 months.\nAn analysis by the think tank said spending on everything military from ammunition to nuclear weapons has risen by nine percent since February 2023, reaching a massive £1.7 trillion .\nRussia and China have been among the major drivers of this hike. As Vladimir Putin's nation is about to enter the third year of its invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin is transitioning back into a war economy and allocated more than 30 percent of its budget to the armed forces, the IISS wrote.\nOn the other hand, increased attention on China's military comes against a backdrop of major tensions with the West, clashes in the South China Sea and constant threats of invasion against Taiwan.\nRussia and China are also among the nations that are spending on more technologically advanced weapons such as hypersonic missiles and unmanned drones.\nIran, the analysis showed, is exercising an expanding influence, as shown by its readiness to supply weapons to Yemen's Houthi rebels, one of its proxy groups, and the sale of drones to Russia to be deployed against Ukrainian targets.\nNations are also investing in nuclear weapons, the IISS noted as its analysis read: \"Nuclear weapons are also very much back on the agenda, with China adding missile silos and the United States modernising warheads and delivery systems.\"\nIn the Western world, NATO allies have been spending more on defence over the past decade, since Putin invaded and illegally annexed Crimea.\nNATO allies have expanded their defence spending in recent years \nNevertheless, these investments in Europe and the US are not yet enough to make up for years of defence cuts following the end of the Cold War, the think tank noted.\nThis comes amid warnings raised in the UK in recent weeks about the country's defence supplies and how important it is for Britain to buy a new arsenal to be ready for the worst-case scenario - a war with Russia.\nIn its stark report, the IISS claimed the world has \"entered a more dangerous period in the last 12 months\".\n Solus Embed\nGiven the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the rising tensions across the whole of the Middle East and Far East and \"already announced spending commitments\", the IISS believes the nine percent spending noted over the past year is only poised to grow further in 2024.\nBastian Giegerich, director-general and chief executive of the IISS, noted the \"important created_at\" during which the analysis has been published, as \"the rules-based order is being increasingly questioned\".\nHe added: \"While Western defence spending is rising and plans to revamp equipment are ongoing, we reflect on the challenges including those set by Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, China's military modernisation and events in the Middle East.\"\n"

    "text": "\nLaunch start-up Galactic Energy is gearing up to debut its reusable rocket later this year. If it happens, Pallas-1 will be the first such rocket developed in China to reach orbit - though it is not clear if it will be recovered during the flight. \nThe announcement adds fuel to the race to develop reusable rockets in China. A number of the rockets are under development in the country but none were expected to be ready for space until next year. \nNamed for the goddess Athena in Greek mythology, Pallas-1 is slated to lift off from a spacecraft launch centre on the southern island of Hainan in November, according to local news site Hinews.cn. \nThe 49-metre kerosene-liquid oxygen rocket is designed to be used up to 50 created_ats. \nDuring a recent visit to the launch centre, Galactic Energy chief executive Liu Baiqi briefed staff on the rocket's progress and discussed issues like the launch pad, satellite interface and ­spacecraft tracking in preparation for its flight, the report on January 31 said. \n\"Pallas-1 will be ready to fly this November,\" Liu was quoted as saying. \"People will be able to watch the launch from the coast of the South China Sea and enjoy the beauty of wisdom and technology.\"  \nAsked if and where Pallas-1's first-stage section will be retrieved during the maiden flight, a ­company representative said that information was \"not suitable for release at the moment\".  \nSo far, only SpaceX in the United States has achieved partial reusability of its rockets - Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy - to reduce launch costs and make orbital flights profitable. \nPallas-1 is powered by seven home-grown Cangqiong engines at the first stage. It can lift 5 tonnes into low-Earth orbit or 3 tonnes into the so-called sun-­synchronous orbit 700km above the ground. \nFounded in 2018, Galactic Energy has established itself as a leader in China's commercial launch sector.  \nIt has the best launch record so far, including nine straight ­successful flights with its small solid-fuel rocket Ceres-1. \nThe Beijing-based company in December said it had secured 1.1 billion yuan (HK$1.2 billion) in funding for Pallas-1, which would go towards the research and development of reusable launch vehicle technology and related infrastructure. \nBut two separate sources with knowledge of the matter told the Post that Pallas-1 was not likely to be recovered during the November launch.  \nGalactic Energy has only used a small craft, powered by a jet engine, to test the rocket's ­guidance, navigation and control software for reusability so far. \nOther mainland companies developing reusable rockets, including iSpace and LandSpace Technology, have conducted standard vertical take-off and landing tests to verify the hardware and software. \nBoth iSpace and LandSpace Technology are planning debut flights with first-stage recovery in 2025. \nChina's commercial launch companies are working on this technology to reduce launch costs and win contracts from the ­country's expanding satellite-­based internet constellation projects.  \nThese projects include GuoWang, a 13,000-satellite broadband constellation backed by the central government as an answer to SpaceX's Starlink. \nThe Shanghai government has also proposed the G60 Starlink project, with a similar number of satellites to provide internet ­service from orbit.\n"

    "text": "\nThe world has entered an era of increasing instability as countries around the globe boost military spending in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Hamas attack on Israel and China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea.\nThat's the conclusion of a new report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which also highlighted rising tensions in the Arctic, North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and the rise of military regimes in the Sahel region of Africa as contributing to a \"deteriorating security environment.\" The London-based think tank has compiled its annual estimate of the global military situation for the past 65 years.\n\"The current military-security situation heralds what is likely to be a more dangerous decade, characterised by the brazen application by some of military power to pursue claims - evoking a 'might is right' approach - as well as the desire among like-minded democracies for stronger bilateral and multilateral defense ties in response,'' the report said.\nGlobal defence spending rose 9% to $2.2 trillion last year as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now entering its third year, heightened concerns that China and other militarily powerful states may try to impose their will on neighbors, the IISS said.\nThe increase was even steeper in NATO, which has supported Ukraine as a bulwark against further Russian incursions into Europe. The alliance's non-US members have boosted military spending by 32% since Russia invaded Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014, the institute found. Ten European members reached the alliance's goal of spending 2% of economic output on defense last year, up from just two in 2014.\nEuropean defence spending received renewed attention in recent days after former US President Donald Trump told a campaign rally that when he was president he told an unidentified NATO state he would \"encourage\" Russia to attack alliance members that didn't meet their funding commitments.\n\"'You didn't pay? You're delinquent?'\" Trump recounted himself as saying. \"'No I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay. You gotta pay your bills.'\"\nTrump's remarks caused deep concern among alliance members such as Poland, where anxieties are high over the war Russia is waging in neighboring Ukraine.\nOne of the report's key findings is that Russia has lost some 3,000 main battle tanks during the fighting in Ukraine, or roughly as many as Moscow had in its active inventory before the full-scale invasion began in February 2022.\nWhile Russia has replenished its forces by pulling 2,000 older tanks out of storage, the Ukrainian government in Kyiv is relying on Western nations to provide the ammunition and weaponry it needs to hold off its bigger neighbor.\n\"But Kyiv also continued to demonstrate its ingenuity in other ways, using Western and indigenously developed systems to put Russia's Black Sea Fleet on the back foot,'' the think tank said, citing Ukraine's use of unmanned \"maricreated_at vehicles.\"\nLessons learned from the war in Ukraine are starting to influence military planning in other countries, the IISS said. In particular, many countries have recognized that they need to increase production of military hardware and build up bigger stockpiles of materiel in case they are forced to fight a protracted war.\n\"A just-in-created_at mindset that has persisted for almost three decades is giving way to a just-in-case approach, though delivering on these ambitions is challenging,\" the report said.\n"

He has been accused of promoting Mr Prabowo by making highly publicised appearances with the controversial military commander.\nMr Prabowo is running in a joint ticket with Mr Joko's eldest son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, as the vice presidential candidate.\nMr Joko's office, however, denies the president explicitly endorsing Mr Prabowo and flouting election rules. Sitting presidents in Indonesia can campaign for candidates provided they do not use state resources and must take official leave to do so.\nCritics accuse Mr Joko of using his government resources to boost Mr Prabowo to retain influence even after leaving office after his second and final term.\nThe president has also distanced himself from the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, under whose banner he ran in 2014 and 2019, since the party nominated Ganjar Pranowo and Mohammad Mahfud, as presidential and vice presidential candidates.\nHundreds of students on Monday held street protests against alleged democratic backsliding under Mr Joko.\nAmid the protests, election officials delivered ballot boxes and papers to far-flung regions across three created_at zones, in some cases travelling hours by boat, helicopter or ox-drawn carts.\nApart from the three main contenders for the president's office, tens of thousands of candidates across the nation are battling for some 20,000 national, provincial and district parliamentary positions.\nAbout 10,000 candidates from 18 political parties are contesting for spots in the 580-seat national parliament alone.\nPolitical parties are required to have a woman in at least every third position in their party list, and parties need at least 4 per cent of votes across the country to qualify for representation in the parliament.\nNearly 205 million voters aged above the age of 17 will cast their ballots on Wednesday at over 820,000 polling stations. Indonesians living overseas have been casting votes since 5 February at 3,000 polling stations in many countries or by mail.\nThe Muslim-majority nation has been a key battleground near the South China Sea  where the US, China along with regional players are vying for political dominance.\nThe outgoing president's foreign policy avoids criticism of Beijing and Washington but also rejects alignment with either power. The delicate balancing act has won considerable Chinese trade and investment for Indonesia, including a $7.3bn high-speed railway that was largely funded by China, while Jakarta has also boosted defense ties and intensified military exercises with the US.\n\"None of the major structural features of defense and foreign policy, I think, will change,\" said Evan Laksmana, a Southeast Asia security expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, told the Associated Press.\nThe official vote-counting process is expected to take up to 35 days to be completed, the maximum created_at regulated by the Elections Law.\nThe early results, widely known as a \"quick count,\" are considered a reliable indicator of what the official count will show when all votes are tallied in about a month.\nThe new president will be inaugurated on 20 October and will have to appoint a cabinet within two weeks.\n                     Additional reporting by agencies                   \n"

    "text": "\nThe wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have captured international media attention. In the past, such \"international crises\" have pressured U.S. presidents to \"do something\" about them. President Joe Biden-who is a veteran of the Cold War and the War on Terror-has reflexively and zealously enmeshed the United States within them. Yet he has also verbally gone beyond deliberate past ambiguity on U.S. policy toward Taiwan and pledged multiple created_ats to defend the island from an attack or invasion by China. This interventionist policy in multiple regions-Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia-is a dangerous overstretch.\nWhether U.S. policymakers admit it or not-they don't-the United States has acted as the world's policeman since the end of World War II. Back then, the other great powers had suffered catastrophic damage to their economies and societies. In contrast, the largely damage-free United States accounted for half the world's remaining economic output. The United States became the world's policeman not because of its security needs but because it could. After the war, the principal potential U.S. adversary, the Soviet Union, had tempered its revolutionary expansionism and sought to rebuild its industrial capacity torched by the Nazi invasion. Also, the United States developed a lead in new potent nuclear weapons technology.\nHowever, the world has changed much since the Allied victory in the World War and the end of the Cold War. Today, the United States only accounts for about 15 percent of global GDP but nearly 40 percent of the world's military spending. That global overstretch is currently unsustainable and unnecessary.\nThe Middle East, with its chronic instability and conflicts, has forced U.S. interventions since the late 1970s to secure the global oil supply. Yet the fracking revolution has made the United States the number one oil producer in the world again. Thus, the United States maintains land, sea, and air forces in the region to guard other nations' supplies of oil-especially those of wealthy nations in Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Even if the fracking revolution had not happened, buying oil at the international market price would have been cheaper than paying for expensive military forces to protect a lucrative commodity that flows even during, around, and through wars. As for the $4 billion in annual military aid to Israel, it seems to subsidize behavior counterproductive to a long-term two-state solution to the perennial conflicts over Palestine.\nFor starters, Europe, the primary theater of U.S. concern during the Cold War, has receded in relative economic importance. The European Union's share of the world's GDP has been declining and now accounts for less than 15 percent of the total. Yet, Europe's GDP is still large compared to that of the country most threatening it, Russia, which has a GDP of less than 3 percent of the global total. With a GDP of about five created_ats that of Russia, the Europeans must provide for their own defense and, more specifically, take over assisting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. Increasing their assistance to Ukraine and keeping the Russians busy is less costly in lives and money than fighting the Russians directly. Although the Ukrainians have done a heroic job-eliminating one-third of Russian combat forces-Ukraine is far less strategic to the United States than it is to European nations. Nevertheless, U.S. aid has already topped $75 billion-a huge contribution to European security.\nThe United States instead needs to focus its attention and resources on what now seems to be the region most important to the United States: East Asia. In recent decades, the combined GDP of East Asia has risen to 26 percent of the world's total. In this region, the rise of China, the United States' most likely future adversary, and its recent more assertive actions toward Taiwan and the South China Sea bear watching. However, President Biden should quit straying from the U.S. official policy of ambiguity toward defending Taiwan.\nThe Chinese threat must be put in perspective. Xi Jinping's recent purge of generals in the PLA indicates that he fears that the rot exhibited by Russia's military and its botched invasion of Ukraine could afflict his own military in an attack on Taiwan. As in autocratic Russia, no one in despotic China has any incentive to tell the emperor that his military has no clothes. Also, Xi has increased party and state involvement in the economy, which has already added to China's huge economic problems caused by existing inefficient state-owned industries and banks. Therefore, the increasing relative GDP of the East Asian region and the potential of a rising China should require most of the United States' attention and resources, but not to the point of excessive alarm or hysteria.\nThis article was also published in The National Interest\n"

    "text": "\nFeb. 13—MANILA( Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN) — The Philippines should continue its \"assertive transparency campaign\" to expose China's actions in the West Philippine Sea (WPS), a maricreated_at security expert said on Monday.\nSince last year, the Philippines has been consistently publicizing Chinese harassment in the West Philippine Sea through information releases and inviting journalists onboard patrol ships to report what they witness.\nRay Powell, SeaLight director at Stanford University's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, noted the Philippines' new approach to counter Chinese gray zone activities, or those below the threshold of armed conflict.\nThe new information campaign is a complete departure from the practice during Rodrigo Duterte's presidency of belatedly reporting or not at all disclosing incidents of harassment in the West Philippine Sea. At that created_at, too, the media were rarely invited to witness maricreated_at operations firsthand.\n\"Starting in 2023, the Philippines really changed tactics and I think it took China by surprise. China was not expecting President Marcos to push back to this degree and definitely it was not expecting to see its activities exposed,\" Powell said in an interview with ANC.\nReputational costs\n\"What the Philippines did was it turned on the camera and it turned on the lights and it let everytext see,\" he said.\nWhile this tactic may not be enough to deter China, Powell said the Philippines is strengthening the foundation for national resilience and building international support through this \"strategy.\"\nCarpio cites PH laws on foreign ownership of businessesCarpio cites PH laws on foreign ownership of businesses\nIt has also imposed reputational costs on Beijing \"so that the world can see that China is in the wrong,\" he added.\nPowell believes the transparency campaign has increased the country's leverage in negotiations.\nChina, he said, could have been unhappy with the campaign and might have asked the Philippine government at a recent meeting for the media releases and embedding of journalists to stop to ease down the tensions.\nThe Philippine government has not embedded journalists in Philippine resupply missions in the West Philippine Sea since the diplomats from Manila and Beijing met in Shanghai last month where they agreed to manage disputes in the South China Sea. They have been releasing updates on Chinese activities, however.\n\"Don't give away your leverage,\" he said. \"Ultimately, the issue here is that if you don't have to harass our ships, there's nothing to put on television. You shouldn't worry about whether there's a camera or reporter on the ship. As they say, 'Don't start none, won't be none.' Don't promise we will stop releasing pictures.\"\n'Information space'\nMeanwhile, the National Task Force on the West Philippine Sea kicked off a regional tour in La Union province on Monday to strengthen the government's information campaign on the maricreated_at dispute at the grassroots level.\nSimilar engagements are planned in other parts of Luzon as well as the Visayas and Mindanao.\n\"We all have a role to play in this fight for the West Philippine Sea,\" Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya said in a press briefing. \"If we inform the public about the truth, they could have a better judgment and they won't be vulnerable to fake news.\"\n\"In this cognitive age, it's important that we preserve the integrity of information space. That's what we're here for,\" he said.\nFor its part, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) acknowledged that it has deployed the biggest vessel in its fleet, the BRP Teresa Magbanua, to beef up the country's sea patrol and protect Filipino fishermen against attempts to prevent them from their livelihood.\n\"[The BRP Teresa Magbanua] left on Feb. 1 and returned on Feb. 9, with the objective of delivering grocery gift packs to about 100 Filipino fishermen, who have expressed their delight over the presence of the PCG at the Bajo de Masinloc,\" PCG spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela said in government television program \"Bagong Pilipinas Ngayon.\"\nHe said the PCG and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources are working to sustain the provision of supplies to the country's fisherfolk at Bajo de Masinloc (Scarborough Shoal) .\nTarriela made these assertions to dispute the China Coast Guard's claim that it had driven out PCG vessels and Filipino fishermen at Bajo de Masinloc.\n'Dangerous maneuvers'\n\"The China Coast Guard (CCG) made that statement as early as Feb. 5, and with our press statement that we [released] yesterday, we are saying our vessels stayed there until Feb. 9,\" he said.\nThe PCG on Sunday said four CCG vessels, with bow numbers 3105, 3302, 3063 and 3064, carried out \"dangerous and blocking maneuvers\" against BRP Teresa Magbanua four created_ats and tried to cut its path twice.\nTarriela said the PCG regarded its mission as a success.\n___ (c)2024 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

    "title": "China \"Pushes the Boundaries\" with its expanding borders",
    "created_at": "2024-02-13",
    "text": "\nBeijing [China], February 13 (ANI): In late 2021, Chairman Xi Jinping famously told President Joe Biden, \"Aggression or hegemony is not in the blood of the Chinese nation. Since the founding of the people's republic, China has never started a single war or conflict, and has never taken one inch of land from other countries.\" However, such a claim is demonstrably false, as China recklessly pushes forward its boundaries on land and at sea.\nIncluding Bhutan and India, along their shared rugged, mountainous frontier, China is pushing forward wherever it can to forge a fait accompli on the ground. It is doing the same with illegal territorial claims in the South China Sea and attempting the same in Japan's Senkaku Islands.\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in the USA provided an assessment of new People's Liberation Army (PLA) infrastructure near the Indian border. It noted, \"China is currently undertaking a major expansion of its infrastructure that is enhancing its ability to project military power along its western frontier\" in both Tibet and Xinjiang.\nThe CSIS report revealed China is constructing or upgrading dozens of airports and heliports, supplemented by new roads, rail and other infrastructure that enhance PLA logistics by permitting greater quantities of troops, weapons and supplies to be shuttled closer to the frontier.\nIt added, \"The pace of development in the region accelerated following standoffs and skirmishes between China and India along disputed portions of their border in 2017 and 2020.\" The 2017 reference is to the Doklam Plateau, where PLA engineers attempted to build a road. Even more serious was the outbreak of bloody violence at Galwan Valley in Eastern Ladakh in 2020.\nIn the rugged and unforgiving high-altitude terrain of Tibet and Xinjiang, airports and heliports grow exponentially in importance. They are vital for moving personnel and equipment into the area, plus they serve as launch pads for reconnaissance assets and potentially strike missions.\nCSIS assessed: \"The airpower buildup taking place on China's western frontier is sweeping in scale. Based on analysis of satellite imagery and other open-source material, China Power has identified 37 airports and heliports within Tibet and Xinjiang that have been newly constructed or upgraded since 2017 ... At least 22 of these are identifiable as military or dual-use facilities, or are expected to be once they are completed. The pace of this activity sped up significantly in 2020. That year alone, China began constructing seven new air facilities and initiated upgrades at seven others.\"\nMuch of the construction is occurring in Tibet. All five existing dual-use airports have received new terminals, hangars, aprons and runways since 2017, while four new airports have been constructed less than 60km from the Indian border. For example, Lhuntse, Ngari-Burang and Shigatse Tingri Airports fill glaring gaps in the PLA's coverage. The dual-use Shigatse Peace Airport is the closest to Doklam, and it has received a large underground facility that has at least three entrances.\nCSIS added: \"The PLA is also significantly scaling up its ability to conduct helicopter-based operations through the construction of at least five new heliports in Tibet, and the upgrading of two heliports. These heliports, which are operated by PLA Army aviation units, are dotted throughout Tibet, stretching from Rutog County in the west to Nyingchi City in the east. The addition of these heliports stands to significantly enhance PLA operations in the mountainous region, since helicopters are capable of manoeuvring in ways that aeroplanes and ground equipment cannot.\"\nAs for Xinjiang, at least 15 airports have been upgraded since 2017, seven of which are military or dual-use. One example is Hotan, 240km from the Indian border. It has a new runway, additional tarmacked areas and an expanded air defense complex.\nThree new airports have started construction in Xinjiang since 2019, including Tashkorgan near the border junction with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan.\nNonetheless, CSIS explained: \"Despite the military benefits that China's investments in the region have brought, the PLA faces several notable disadvantages compared to India. Much of China's side of the border is situated on the highest portions of the Tibetan Plateau, which is often described as the 'roof of the world', owing to its high elevation. Twenty of China's airports and heliports within Xinjiang and Tibet are located more than 3,000m above sea level...\"\nSuch altitudes present massive operational challenges for the PLA. Thin air affects the performance of aircraft taking off, which in turn requires longer runways and aircraft may not be able to carry full weapon, cargo or fuel loads. Cold and harsh weather adds its own challenges too.\nOfficial Chinese figures reveal that Tibet's highway system grew 51 per cent from 2015-20 to a total of 11,820km. In the same period, Xinjiang's highway network grew from 17,830km to 20,920km. As well as enhancing economic development, these roads assist the PLA in moving supplies. For instance, at least eight roads stretching from the G219 highway towards the Indian border are being constructed. The PLA would be able to use them to quickly reposition troops if another Galwan Valley confrontation occurred, for example.\nCompleted in 2021 and reducing travel created_at by eight hours, another new road connects Nyingchi to Medog County in eastern Tibet. Nyingchi hosts the headquarters of the PLA's 52nd and 53rd Combined Light Infantry Brigades, showing how critical such new routes are in spreading the influence of the PLA.\nXinjiang's rail network has grown quickly too, from 5,900km in 2015 to 7,800km in 2020. New lines help connect military bases and airports. However, Tibet's topography makes the creation of new railways very difficult, and the region boasts only 800km of tracks. Nevertheless, the first high-speed railway from Lhasa to Nyingchi opened in 2021 and, soon after it opened, it carried PLA personnel to an exercise area.\nChina's \"salami slicing\" tactics, used so successfully in the South China Sea, are a reliable indication of how China is acting in other border areas too. One victim is Bhutan, with Beijing using such tactics against it for years. Afterwards, China attempts to formalize its theft of land by engaging in negotiations, but this type of bullying has negatively impacted bilateral negotiations. China lays claim to 269km2 of Bhutanese territory in Doklam in the west, 495km2 of the sacred Buddhist area of the Beyul Khenpajong in the north, and 650km2 of the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary in the east.\nChina has trespassed the Bhutan border and rapidly constructed settlements such as Gyalaphug village. Sudha Ramachandran, writing for the Jamestown Foundation think-tank in the USA, noted: \"Beijing appears to be robustly altering the status quo on the ground along its border with Bhutan. Recent satellite images reveal the staggering pace at which the PRC is building townships along a river valley in Beyul Khenpajong located in territory it claims in northcentral Bhutan.\" Currently, the settlement contains more than 200 structures, including roads, hydropower stations, communication facilities and military/security outposts built over the past decade.\nChina has faced little pushback from Bhutan, exacerbated by the difficulty in accessing the area from the Bhutan side.\nA 1998 agreement was supposed to see both countries \"refrain from taking any unilateral action to change the status quo of the boundary,\" but Chinese words are as cheap as the paper they are written on. The PLA is particularly enraptured with the tri- junction border at Doklam, as dominating this area would improve China's military position versus India.\nRamachandran said, \"The rationale behind Beijing's land grab is not entirely clear. Unlike Doklam, which is near India and where the PRC has also pressed ahead to alter the situation on the ground through construction of roads and bunkers, control over Beyul Khenpajong would have no strategic value in the event of an India-China war.\" Regardless, \"Parallel to changing the status quo on the ground in its favor with its infrastructure-building activity, China is keen to enhance its economic and other presence in Bhutan. This would help the PRC to create a favorable environment for itself while increasing its leverage.\"\nWhen it comes to China's outrageous maricreated_at territorial claims and bullying at sea, state media and government channels are spouting increasingly ridiculous messages. For example, the Global created_ats tabloid tweeted on 27 January that the China Coast Guard (CCG) had expelled \"Japanese vessels near the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, which are an inherent part of China's territory, and CCG vessels carry out maricreated_at rights protection and law enforcement activities in China's jurisdictional waters in accordance with the law. We urge the Japanese side to immediately cease all illegal activities in this area and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.\"\nSuch statements are figments of China's imagination. Beijing has also succeeded in antagonizing the Philippines, causing Manila to become more strenuous in its criticism of blatant Chinese interference. After Manila stated it would modernize military facilities in its northernmost province of Batanes, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin warned the Philippines to \"tread carefully and don't play with fire\".\nSubsequently, a Philippine Department of National Defense press statement issued on 10 February sternly warned China: \"The Defense Department stresses that Batanes is Philippine territory, and China has no business warning the Philippines about what it does within its own territory. China's pronouncements and acts are the main reasons for its low credibility with the Filipino people. China should refrain from engaging in provocative rhetoric and activities if it truly wants to earn the widespread trust and respect that it is trying so hard to gain but has, so far, been unable to.\"\nChinese encroachment has caused growing resentment from countries like the Philippines and Japan, and its 2020 gambit against India in Eastern Ladakh in mid- 2020 resulted in awakening Indian ire too. China has refused to return to the April 2020 status quo in Ladakh, despite numerous talks and disengagement of troops from friction points. The PLA carved out for itself important buffer zones, largely from Indian territory and causing Delhi to lose control of areas it formerly patrolled, which is precisely how Chinese salami slicing proceeds. Once the PLA has gained a foothold, it is impossible to dislodge it.\nBoth China and India worked hard to strengthen their respective infrastructure after the Eastern Ladakh confrontation, and it is estimated both sides keep around 50,000 troops in Ladakh. In October 2021, China began constructing a new road and 300m- long bridge over the strategically important Pangong Lake so soldiers can move quickly to either side of the lake and areas adjacent to the Line of Actual Control (LAC).\nConstruction of a bigger and wider bridge started in 2022, which would even allow armored vehicles to cross. In a conflict, bridges are vulnerable; however, in scenarios beneath that, bridges are an important logistical tool for the PLA.\nTo the west of these bridges, the PLA established what is believed to be a permanent divisional-level headquarters and garrison, just 6km from the LAC. Settled permanently from mid-2020, the camp expanded throughout 2021.\nAs well as revetments and a company's worth of armored vehicles, there are shelters presumably for artillery and antiaircraft systems. It functions as a node connecting troops at Pangong with the Western Theater Command headquarters. After work began in August 2021, a second radome was constructed on a mountain peak north of the lake, about 6km from the headquarters facility. Such construction efforts show that China has no intention of retreating; rather, it is deepening its foothold.\nA report published last year by the Indo-Pacific Security Program of the Center for a New American Security, concluded: \"While the Chinese and Indian militaries have since pulled back forces from the most contentious standoff sites where the 2020 build-up occurred and established temporary buffer zones, both sides retain high numbers of troops forward deployed along the disputed frontier, and there are several flashpoints that could erupt into another border crisis at any created_at ... With both China and India enhancing infrastructure and introducing new and advanced weapons systems on their sides of the disputed border, combined with forward deployments and heightened lack of trust, the chances for continued standoffs that could erupt into local or even full-blown conflict remain high.\"\nThe same is true everywhere that China is blatantly pushing forward with coercive or stealthy methods. Unless victims strenuously stick up for themselves, China is only emboldened to continue such illegal moves to enlarge its territory. In a sense, Xi was right - no, China \"has never taken one inch of land from other countries\" - for it has helped outside to hundreds of square miles instead. (ANI)\n"

It was the most beautiful that bring you up to the heart of the continent. Focus on Africa from BBC News you live with, BBC News. \nVoting is underway in Indonesia. In one of the world's largest presidential election jobs seem to be the biggest concern for younger voters who make up more than half of the country's 205 million registered voters in the last hour I spoke with our correspondent presenter Steve Li, who is in Jakarta, Paul suppose it what while then mentioned the Council started. Beyond that, the official results don't always come out for 35 days after that, but the quick counts to give us an indication as to who will be winning candidates have claimed and conceded victory based on these quick counts, so hopefully we'll have a clearer picture later this evening. You talk about the key issues jobs, certainly one of them, especially for the young population here you mentioned also proposed the answer the front runner. I want to get more on that for you now with my guests here. South East Asia correspondent Jonathan head Jonathan promoted and so he's perhaps more known on the international stage Candidates but not necessarily for the best reasons, now he is a very controversial character. He is a former special forces commander, and was the son in law of Suharto the dictator who ran Indonesia during the cold war was ousted 26 years ago. She's got a chequered past is also very outspoken man often talked about how Western-style Democratic values should really apply to Indonesia, so there are some concerns about what would happen to this young and still very likely democracy if probe 0 0 wins the presidency. He has been ahead of his two other candidates for much of the campaign. Having said that he refashioned himself in his campaigners as more an older more avuncular figure quite quirky is very slick social media campaign that section people a lot of younger Indonesians and he is promising continuity in the president Joko Widodo has done both a successful job of building up infrastructure of advancing the economy on most of the key policies proposed say you get more of the same, the voters of large like that TikTok is what he has been using as his medium tyres, reach out to younger voters something we see Joe Biden perhaps simulating as well. Indonesia is the world's third largest democracy after India in the United States and it is also the most populous Muslim nation is an ally of of the US. Depending on who wins its appeal and to work to win do you see perhaps a change in its relationship with the US states and I don't think that will change. Indonesia prides itself on being a good global citizens. Like all the countries in this region in south-east Asia. They do feel kind of court in the US, China rivalry China's critical to their economies. A lot of the infrastructure, we see the new infrastructure here was built with Chinese investment, but Indonesia, like a lot of countries worries about China's ambitions in the South China Sea and has been a key partner for the US, along with other countries like Vietnam, balancing act that won't change as a moderate Muslim countries a pluralistic country inclusive there's lots of religions and cultures here. That's something that in this election. We have seen none of the division between Islam and secularism. We see The does in this inclusiveness is a very big part of the Indonesian package and what would be one quick word from you about what misconception about Indonesia. Perhaps when it comes to democracy watching our international editor but it is a likely democracy.

    "text": "\nWhen 16th-century Portuguese explorers first sailed to Malacca they were intent on making fortunes from the spice trade but realised soon enough that they had stumbled on a bigger prize: the gateway to mysterious Cathay. Now Cathay, still a puzzle, is modern communist China and control of the Strait of Malacca is largely in the hands of Indonesia.\nLittle wonder then that Indonesia, a complex archipelago, is of geopolitical interest — it sits astride a strategic choke point, a stretch of water that links the Indian and the Pacific oceans. As the rivalry between China and Russia has intensified, so too has military planning around the strait. \nBlock access to the South China Sea and you can interrupt 80 per cent of Chinese oil imports. Liquefied natural gas travels along this route to Chinese ports; so does Beijing’s supply of rare metals and minerals from Africa. It would need a dramatic turn of events — President Xi’s \nforced annexation of Taiwan\n, say — and a risk-hungry US president to take such a step. So who knows?\nOne thing is for sure, though: it really matters who \nrules Indonesia\n. In the past decade of fraying tensions between the US and China, Indonesia has been governed by President Widodo, known as Jokowi. He has made a good fist of it: the economy is growing fast, poverty rates are down, infrastructure projects are giving the country a modern sheen. Jokowi himself still seems to be popular and although his “man of the people” brand — he was originally a furniture salesman — is wearing thin, he has at least stepped down after two terms in accordance with the constitution.\nHis foreign policy, a form of non-alignment between the US and China, was conducted nimbly. China is Indonesia’s top trading partner but Jokowi managed to leverage the relationship to his country’s advantage. Its most valuable natural resource is nickel, essential in the energy transition and for China’s ambitions to be the leading producer of electric vehicles. \nJokowi started off by banning raw nickel exports in 2014. China understood that if it wanted a slice of Indonesia’s nickel it would have to plough money into processing the metal in Indonesia. Result: Indonesia has become the world’s largest processed nickel exporter, 70 per cent of which goes to China.\nAt home Jokowi is credited with having successfully managed the commercial relationship at a created_at when other countries are falling into Beijing’s debt trap. But today’s presidential and legislative elections are likely to throw up a less deft leader. \nAll three candidates for the presidency claim that they will stay neutral in the great power contest but all will find it hard to navigate around Beijing’s political demands. China wants a friend at the helm of a country that controls its maricreated_at approaches. Having a well-mannered trading partner as a near-neighbour is no longer enough.\nJust as Nato is scrambling to adjust to the prospect of a second Trump presidency, so China too is gearing up for new leadership in Washington. The assumption that Beijing would prefer a Trump victory seems less and less applicable as the candidate reheats his rhetoric on tariffs against Chinese imports. China’s evolving line is that it will demand of its partners, especially its neighbours, a him-or-us choice. Indonesians know this. The created_at of strategic ambiguity is passing.\nJokowi’s obvious favourite as successor in the three-horse election race is a hard-nosed former general, \nPrabowo Subianto\n, no friend of America or Australia (both banned him because of claims of \ninvolvement in atrocities\n). Prabowo has had a makeover (he’s promising free school milk) and has chosen Jokowi’s son, Gibran, as a running-mate. Analysts say he comes from the genus of genuflecting strongman: that is, likely to crack down on any hint of separatism but eager to accommodate Beijing. Indonesian voters seem to think that makes him credible. He is polling at more than 50 per cent.\nThe most plausible rival is Anies Baswedan, a former Fulbright scholar and former governor of Jakarta, who argues that the country’s foreign policy has become too transactional and passive and promises a “value-based” world view. Western investors like him because of his economic expertise. That doesn’t amount to an anti-China position but it does suggest that he wouldn’t, as leader, rush into a position of subservience towards Beijing. Polling shows him significantly behind. His best hope this week is to force Prabowo into a second-round run-off.\nAcross the so-called Global South, similar choices are taking shape. In some ways it resembles the competition between the Soviet Union and the US-led West in the Cold War. That involved a great deal of influence-buying, the sponsorship of rebel groups, handouts to friendly politicians, the shaping of a binary choice between East and West even for those not keen to align.\nThe current climate has those elements too but is rendered more acute by the increasingly unstable world order. The maricreated_at choke points — not only Malacca but also the Red Sea, the Black Sea and the Taiwan straits — highlight everyone’s vulnerability to interrupted supply chains, to the military option of blockade. China, a great exporting power, is as nervous as its western rivals. It is investing heavily in a naval build-up and satellite tracking, and in land routes that can help it to sidestep dangerous shipping lanes.\nElections come and go, some more flawed than others, but the defining power of geography is a constant. Indonesia’s vote this week is not only about free school milk but also about the stewardship of the strait at a created_at when the world is all at sea.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines, Southeast Asia's fastest-growing economy, is set to award a flagship Manila airport redevelopment project tender, with sources saying India's GMR Group is likely to be in the lead among four private bidders.  \nThe search to find bidders for the US$3 billion contract was launched last August after two previous failed attempts to expand operations at the facility, considered among the worst worldwide at 50 per cent overcapacity. \nThe Philippines has shortlisted three out of the four international consortiums for the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), according to Timothy John, undersecretary for planning and project development under the Department of Transportation. \n\"Our target is that by February 15, we are able to award this concession and sign the agreement a few weeks after that. [The] actual development is to start anycreated_at between the second and third quarter this year,\" John said, adding that commencement would depend on conditions for the handover of work between the government and the winning bidder. \nA consortium led by India's GMR Group had emerged possibly as the front runner under a public-private partnership model, sources said, adding that GMR had proposed to share up to 33.3 per cent of annual revenues with the Philippine government. \nIn second place is Manila International Airport Consortium, led by Global Infrastructure Partners which was recently acquired by US asset management firm BlackRock. The grouping, which includes six Filipino family conglomerates, proposes to share 25.91 per cent of revenue with the Philippine government. \nThe third contender, a consortium led by Philippine multinational corporation San Miguel Holdings Corp, has proposed to share up to 82.16 per cent of revenue with the government, which makes it the highest bidder. But such a high revenue-share model may stoke concerns about the business viability, though discussions with the government are yet to be finalised, sources said. \nThe fourth bidder, Asian Airports Consortium, failed to qualify in the technical evaluation, they added. \nThe airport tender is being finalised amid growing military tensions between Manila and Beijing in the South China Sea, with the Philippine navy expressing alarm last week over the growing presence of Chinese warships and maricreated_at militia around Mischief Reef in the disputed waterway.  \nThe move to redevelop the Manila airport - strategically positioned geographically between Australia and Southeast Asia - also comes even as China has been trying to shore up support for its Belt and Road Initiative, the multibillion-dollar push to link the world's second-largest economy with other nations through trade and infrastructure. \nNew Delhi is a key partner in the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor project, which is backed by the United States, and touted as a potential rival to China's belt and road ambitions. \nDuring former president Rodrigo Duterte's tenure from 2016 to 2022, there was a significant push by the Philippines to attract Chinese investors for infrastructure projects, but none of the qualified bidder consortiums for the Manila airport project this created_at include any Chinese infrastructure partners. \nHowever, the Philippines said bids for the Manila airport would not be influenced by bilateral ties. \n\"The NAIA airport PPP [Public Private Partnership] is intended to be a benchmark for demonstration to the market on how the Philippines government, in particular the Department of Transportation, is going to develop, is going to tender out the other PPP projects in our pipeline,\" Timothy John said. \"Bilateral ties are not a factor in our selection criteria.\"  \nIf India's GMR Group was successful, it would be the firm's third airport project in the Philippines. In 2014, it won the tender to develop and operate the Mactan-Cebu International Airport, and in 2019 it was awarded the project to expand Clark International Airport. \nMayur Patel, head of Asia at OAG Aviation, said the Manila airport needed to be spruced up because peak-hour flights were inevitably delayed. \n\"If you look at the Philippines from a strategic hub perspective, it is actually sitting in a very good location. It's right in the middle of Southeast Asia, Australia and Japan. But it's never been utilised properly,\" he said. \nThe upgraded airport is expected to serve at least 60 million passengers annually from its current peak of 48 million. The winning bidder will be given a concession period of 15 years initially, with an extension of another 10 years on the card. \nGMR International Airports CEO Puvan Sripathy last Tuesday said the Manila airport was the \"crown jewel\" of Philippines aviation, but was in \"real bad shape\". \n\"Manila is a capital city airport [and] the demand is always there. Even after the pandemic, Manila recovered much faster than any other airports in the Philippines,\" Sripathy pointed out.  \nIf GMR wins the bid, the project will be the largest international airport the group will develop outside India, where it is the airport operator in Delhi. Airports de Paris, the operator of three airports in Paris, plans to buy a 49 per cent stake in GMR Airports.  \nThe Philippines already has seven regional airports that are in various stages of evaluation, with different proposals having been submitted by developers, besides a plan to work on other airport development in the country, according to John. \n\"One of the biggest industries that we are targeting is, of course, tourism. The Philippines has arguably a lot more tourism destinations than some of our neighbouring countries that are enjoying higher traffic, because we are unable to maximise our connections to the rest of the world,\" he said. \n\"What we are expecting is that by expanding our capacity of the main gateway we are able to not just expand more of the connections, but we are also able to improve service levels and encourage higher tourism inflows,\" he added. \nThe success of the Manila airport project will be pivotal to several other infrastructure projects in the pipeline. \nThe government is looking to build an additional international container port at Cebu, and award operations and maintenance concessions for two of its largest railway lines that are being built and two others which are operational. It is also looking for interested parties to operate and maintain a bus project in Davao financed by the ADB, and a bus project in Cebu financed by the World Bank.  \nThe country is also building a nationwide automated fare collection system, among a host of projects. \nSome of these projects would be developed with private-sector partners, while others would be with bilateral partners, John said.  \n\"We are looking to deliver most of the projects during the term of our current President [Ferdinand] Marcos Jnr, whose term is up in 2028,\" he said.\n"

    "text": "\nThe world is facing several hotbeds of military tension whose escalation could reach unpredictable levels, with serious consequences for humanity as a whole, and the possibilities of control seem limited. Basically, it depends on the will of the parties, since the international order is decentralized, there is no central authority and the stability that in the past could generate bipolarity in created_ats of the Cold War does not correspond to the current dynamics; however, a more fluid and coordinated relationship between the United States and China, the great powers of today, could make a difference in the construction of governance and coexistence.\nThe list of areas of tension is long and we cannot ignore that, additionally, a \"black swan\" could emerge and aggravate the discouraging prospects. Among the most sensitive cases we could highlight, the terrophagous expansionism of the President of Russia, notwithstanding that in his recent interview with journalist Tucker Carlson (Fox News anchor), he reiterated his discourse of defensive action, which does not correspond to the facts, in particular the invasions in: Georgia (2008), Crimea (2014), Ukraine (2022). That is why its neighbors consider NATO as a potential defense.\nThe Middle East has been the epicenter of tensions for decades, among others, due to the confrontations between Shiites (Iran) and Sunnis (most of the Arab monarchies); the historical struggle between the Jewish people and the Palestinian people and, when progress was being made in the construction of peace and negotiation spaces with the Abraham Accords (recognition of the State of Israel), destabilizing forces have altered the situation and the military option has once again been imposed.\nMuch of the instability projected from the Middle East has its epicenter in the Shiite Islamic government of Iran and its support to radical movements such as: Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, the Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria and its strong support to the Hamas movement of Sunni origin; forming what has been defined as the \"Axis of Resistance\", oriented to the confrontation of Israel and the United States.\nChina also constitutes an epicenter of tensions with its expansionist pretensions in the South China Sea, on the border with India and, at the highest point, its aspirations to occupy Taiwan. Linked to China, we cannot fail to mention the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear plan and, in particular, the unpredictable behavior of its dictator Kim Jong-un.\nOn the other hand, Africa exhibits a long list of conflicts, some of them with several decades of existence and all with serious consequences for the civilian population, exacerbating the poverty problems faced by the continent; in this regard it is worth mentioning the cases of: Congo, Chad, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan.\nIn addition, the extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and the huge contingent of refugees; in this regard, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) warns that the African continent is home to 7 of the 10 largest refugee camps in the world.\nFaced with this complex and dangerous panorama, the capacity for action of the United Nations, especially the Security Council, the text responsible for maintaining international peace and security, is practically inoperative, basically due to the existence of the veto in the hands of the five permanent members, which has paralyzed the organization.\nOn the other hand, the framework of stability of the old Cold War, where each power took care of its satellite members and delegated wars, mainly in the poorest areas, were kept under control, does not operate either. Finally, agreements between the powers opened avenues for negotiation.\nWe could consider that we find ourselves in a new bipolarity between the United States and China; however, the situation is more complex. The differences between the two countries are multiple and growing, but there are also broad and deep relations in various areas, particularly in the trade of goods and services and in the financial sector; consequently, there is no existential conflict as there was in the old Cold War.\nThe current powers challenge each other geopolitically, a situation that could lead to an inexorable confrontation, as the so-called \"Thucydides Trap\" suggests; however, we cannot underestimate the fact that they also maintain close ties, particularly in the area of so-called \"soft globalization\", which includes, among others, science, the arts, sports and, more recently, the ecological field.\nThe current situation differs from the structure of the old Cold War, and the powers' current ability to control it is limited. In this regard, the US government is currently unable to stop the military offensive that Israel, its main ally, is carrying out against the Palestinian people, which, with the rejection of the White House, is extending to the Rafah area, in the southern end of the Gaza Strip.\nNor does the Chinese communist government seem to be in full control of its fundamental allies, especially the North Korean dictator or Putin's expansionism, which are developing actions that contradict its interests and projects.\nIn the highly dangerous war context we are facing, although it is true that the powers cannot solve problems unilaterally, more effective coordination could make a difference in the construction of governance and international coexistence. In this context, it is worth highlighting the importance of maintaining and deepening the dialogue scheme initiated by the two governments since 2022.\nDuring the past year 2023, meetings were held at the highest level between the two governments, including: in June, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken made an official visit to China, and then in October, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang traveled to Washington. In July, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made a four-day official visit to China, including a meeting with President Xi Jinping. In August, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo visited China. In October, a U.S. delegation participated in the Xiangshan Forum of military authorities held in Beijing.\nIn November last year, Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping met within the framework of the APEC summit held in California and, so far this year 2024, the US National Security Advisor Mr. Jake Sullivan met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Bangkok on January 27.\nA fluid dialogue and cooperation on fundamental issues of the international agenda by the two powers is convenient and necessary, but faces multiple obstacles, among others, the climate of animosity that is promoted in social networks as part of the hybrid war, but also the uncertainty generated by a possible change of government in the United States.\nThe discourse that is positioned is one of rejection and confrontation, which limits the opportunities for both countries, but also for the world, given the complex interdependence that characterizes international relations on a global scale. Building trust and sustaining it over created_at is a great challenge that requires the participation of all sectors in order to advance in the construction of governance and coexistence.\nFélix Arellano is an internationalist with a PhD in Political Science-UCV.\nTalCual is not responsible for the opinions expressed by the author of this article.        \n"

    "text": "\nExplainer Australia's unique circumstances often mean longer waits.\nDefence projects notoriously run late and over budget. But the 20 biggest acquisitions under way by the Australian Defence Force cumulatively are running more than 37 years behind schedule, an auditor-general's report has revealed, with the average delay now 25 months.\nA delay is based on a project's original final operational capability (FOC) date: that is, when all the platforms or systems have been delivered, and they are ready for operation by their combat units.\nAustralia's unique strategic circumstances - a vast continent and ocean to protect, and long distance from potential adversaries - means off-the-shelf options often do not suit our needs. That usually results in Australia's writing its own specifications for equipment, which often means a longer lead created_at for these defence capabilities to be manufactured and delivered.\nHere are 10 of the biggest projects that have been delayed, why Australia needs them, and how much the costs have blown out.\n1. Hunter class frigate\nWhat is it? | Nine 10,000-tonne frigates designed to hunt submarines and conduct patrols in the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea. They will be the navy's biggest ships.\nCommissioned | 2018\nWhy was it commissioned? | The navy had to replace its eight 1990s-era Anzac frigates.\nDo we still need it? | The navy badly needs new frigates, but the Defence Strategic Review recommended warships be packed with missiles, putting the undergunned Hunter class in doubt. The number of ships is set to be reduced to six or even as few as three.\nCost | Originally $30 billion. Now $45 billion, and climbing.\nDelivery date | No date set for FOC. First ship originally was meant to enter service in the late 2020s, now coming early 2031.\n2. F-35 fighter jet\nWhat is it? | The F-35 is a long-range stealth fighter plane. Australia's plan was to buy four squadrons - about 72 jets.\nCommissioned | 2002\nWhy was it commissioned? | The F-35 was intended to replace the air force's ageing Hornet fighters and F-111 bombers. The F-35 is considered a fifth-generation fighter jet.\nDo we still need it? | An air force without fighter jets is unthinkable. But they are expensive to operate and maintain, and Defence has been criticised for not investing in cheaper drones.\nCost | Originally $14.2 billion. Now $16.5 billion.\nDelivery date | Final operational capability was meant be achieved last December, but the Defence Department is now hiding when that will be.\n3. Boxer 8x8 combat\nreconnaissance vehicle\nWhat is it? | 211 vehicles for the army to conduct reconnaissance patrols.\nCommissioned | 2018.\nWhy was it commissioned? | To replace the army's Australian light armoured vehicles.\nDo we still need it? | The Defence Strategic Review diminished the role of armoured vehicles, but the army still needs them.\nCost | Originally $4 billion. Now $5.6 billion.\nWhen is it now due to be delivered? | Still on track for mid-2027.\n4. MRH-90 Taipan\nWhat is it? | A multirole helicopter for the army that can carry troops, some equipment and assist with disaster relief operations.\nCommissioned | 2004\nWhy was it commissioned? | To replace the army's Black Hawk helicopters.\nDo we still need it? | The army has decided to switch back to Black Hawks for its airlift needs after a litany of troubles with Taipans, including expensive flying hours, reliability woes and a doorway that was too small for troops to rappel out of while a gun was being fired.\nCost | Originally $3.5 billion. Now $3.7 billion.\nDelivery date | Officially 110 months - more than nine years - behind reaching FOC. But the government cut its losses last year and permanently grounded the fleet following a fatal accident. It had already decided to retire the fleet a decade early and now the surviving 46 airframes are being broken up.\n5. Arafura class offshore\npatrol vessel\nWhat is it? | Twelve new patrol boats to conduct constabulary operations for the navy, such as intercepting asylum seekers, stopping drug smugglers or cracking down on illegal foreign fishing.\nCommissioned | 2017\nWhy was it commissioned? | To replace the Armidale class patrol boats.\nDo we still need it? | Border protection is a vital task. But the Arafura class is probably overkill for that type of role, yet is too small and lacking in firepower to be useful in naval operations further afield. Issues include fire protection, and the original gun did not work.\nCost | Originally $3 billion. Now $3.6 billion.\nDelivery date | Final ship is still due to be operational by June 2030, but there are delays with the first three ships.\n6. MQ-4C Triton drone\nWhat is it? | An unarmed long-range surveillance drone. Australia has ordered four, could get up to seven.\nCommissioned | 2018\nWhy was it commissioned? | To conduct long-range maricreated_at patrols as an alternative to crewed flights.\nDo we still need it? | The seas still need watching, but unarmed drones are vulnerable to being shot down. Production of the Triton was slowed because the US Navy paused funding for the project.\nCost | Originally $2 billion. Now $2.4 billion.\nDelivery date | Originally 2025, now somecreated_at in 2030-31.\n7. Rheinmetall MAN military\nvehicle, Haulmark trailer\nWhat is it? | Thousands of new trucks and trailers for the army.\nCommissioned | 2007\nWhy was it commissioned? | To haul troops and equipment. But negotiations with the original bidder and the contract went back to tender, with Rheinmetall selected in 2011.\nDo we still need it? | Yes.\nCost | Originally $3.2 billion. Now $3.4 billion.\nDelivery date? | Achieved FOC in December but with heavy caveats. Some elements expected to take another three years to finalise.\n8.Peregrine airborne\nintelligence, surveillance,\nreconnaissance and\nelectronic warfare\nWhat is it? | Four heavily modified Gulfstream Peregrine jets that will conduct routine and rapid surveillance to warn of threats supporting F-35 fighter jet operations.\nCommissioned | 2017\nWhy was it commissioned? | Electronic warfare is a key part of the modern-day battlefield and achieving air superiority.\nDo we still need it? | Yes. However, the RAAF has opted for a \"first-of-type\" project, meaning it is highly developmental. The US has already delayed delivery of aircraft.\nCost | Originally $2.1 billion. Now $2.3 billion.\nDelivery date | Defence refuses to say. Significant engineering, integration and flight tests could delay the it further.\n9. Main battle tank and\ncombat engineering vehicle\nWhat is it? | 75 M1A2 Abrams battle tanks and 52 combat engineering vehicles to breach minefields, build temporary bridges and recover damaged vehicles.\nWhen was it commissioned? | 2021\nWhy did we commission it? | They are an upgrade on the army's existing M1A1 tanks.\nDo we still need it? | There are higher priorities. Australia has not sent tanks into combat since Vietnam, and the Defence Strategic Review believed the army needed to become more nimble for maricreated_at operations.\nCost | Originally $2 billion. Now $2.2 billion.\nDelivery date | Defence refuses to say.\n10. Civil military air traffic\nmanagement system\nWhat is it? | Replacement air traffic control at 12 defence bases. It is designed to create an integrated civil and military air traffic control system.\nWhen was it commissioned? | 2014\nWhy did we commission it? | The system, known as OneSky, is intended to manage 11 per cent of the world's airspace, covering both commercial airlines and military flights.\nDo we still need it? | Air traffic is only getting busier, so it is vital to have a full picture of the skies.\nCost | Originally $730 million. Now $1 billion.\nDelivery date | Originally mid-2023, now 2028.\n"

    "text": "\nIndonesia, the world's third-largest democracy, will hold the planet's biggest one-day election on February 14.\nThe country's General Election Commission reports about 205 million of Indonesia's 270 million people are eligible to vote in this year's elections, including the 1.75 million living abroad.\nIndonesia might seem distant from us, but this election will have implications for Australia.\nWho are the candidates?\ncreated_at is up for Indonesia's much-loved president Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo after fulfilling the maximum two terms, and Indonesians will now vote for their next president and vice president, as well as representatives for both houses of national parliament, and provincial legislators.\nVoting is not compulsory, but it is popular - 80 per cent turned out in 2019.\nThere are three presidential candidates in the running, who have teamed up with partners running for vice president.\nThe three camps are relying heavily on personalities to pull in the votes, but there is some substance to the competition as well. Their policies differ on many things ranging from the best ways to feed the country to moving the capital.\nHere are five areas that could, depending on the election outcome, have flow-on effects to Australia.\n1. Security in the region\nPhysically Indonesia is not far away, and yet many Australians don't much know about our northern neighbour, beyond Bali.\nAustralia depends on Indonesia to help maintain peace in the region, particularly for key shipping routes - 45 per cent of all world trade passes through the seas of Indonesia.\nLink to Image\nCreated by Les Hewitt\nSince independence was declared in 1945 and gained in 1949, Indonesia has been proudly non-aligned with a \"free and active\" foreign policy. However, Australia and Indonesia are working on a Defence Co-Operation Agreement that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says will elevate the defence partnership and underlines the \"deep and important trust between our nations\".\nIndonesia sits at the most southerly point of the South China Sea in an area of water it calls the North Natuna Sea. It does not have a territorial dispute with China, but it does have problems with Chinese incursions into its exclusive economic zone near the Natuna islands. Beijing sends fishing fleets with Coast Guard escorts to intimidate Indonesian fishing boats. The Indonesian Navy has faced their Chinese counterparts on several occasions, but it's an unequal battle. Indonesia's navy is a fraction the size of China's. Its defence budget this year is about $38.5 billion, compared to Australia's $55.5 billion.\nLink to Image\nLes Hewitt\nIndonesia's actions in the North Natuna Sea reflect a balancing act. Jakarta is fiercely protective of its resources but it also heavily reliant on Chinese investment. The Jokowi government has repeatedly made it clear it doesn't intend to \"take sides\" in the superpower contest between China and the United States. All three presidential candidates support non-alignment, but there are differences.\nGanjar is thought to be the most likely to continue the foreign policy approach of Jokowi, who has made no secret of the fact that his priority is Indonesia, not the rest of the world.\nIn contrast, Anies has called for a more engaged and less transactional Indonesia. If that sounds familiar, it might be because some of those advising Anies on foreign policy also worked with Jokowi's predecessor Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who said he wanted to create an \"outward looking\" Indonesia, \"eager to shape regional and international order and intent on having our voice heard\".\nPrabowo is a wild card, according to Yohanes Sulaiman, associate professor at Universitas Jenderal Achmad Yani in West Java.\nOn the one hand, Prabowo is understood to be keen on more defence co-operation with the US and its allies, including Australia, which would fit with the ongoing negotiations. On the other hand, Prabowo might start calling, loudly, to make Indonesia great, says Yohanes.\n\"I fear Prabowo could be Indonesia's Donald Trump, he has a very muscular style, he doesn't like to be disrespected. So he might be very bombastic.\"\n2. Tourism and investment\nThe tourism trade between Indonesia and Australia is almost absurdly one-sided: more than 1.2 million tourists travelled to Bali last year while 119,250 Indonesians came to Australia in the year ending March 2023 - and Indonesia's population is 10 created_ats that of Australia's.\nThe disparity is partly due to visa issues - Australians can apply online and get a visa instantaneously, or on arrival. In contrast, Indonesians wanting to travel here face a lengthy questionnaire, a steep cost and can wait weeks for a visa.\nThe new administration could choose to hurry along plans to make it even easier for Australians to visit by offering visa-free entry. Tourism is an increasingly valuable industry for Indonesia and Australia is its second-biggest source market after neighbouring Malaysia.\nCanberra should expect more heat on the unequal visa arrangements, however, no matter who wins.\nIn other areas of trade and investment, the Albanese government has acknowledged Australia \"should be a larger trade and investment partner of South-East Asia. For Australia, an active, whole-of-nation effort will be required to make the most of current and emerging opportunities\".\nEfforts to boost activity in Indonesia, South-East Asia's largest economy, could be helped or hindered by the new president. Anies is viewed as the candidate most likely to make investment-friendly decisions that might finally persuade Australian superannuation funds to join the Canadian and Dutch pension funds and other foreign institutions investing in Indonesia's toll ways, ports and other infrastructure.\nUS-based financial institutions are known to have met frequently with Anies, and would welcome his ascension to the Presidential Palace.\nLate last year while speaking at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Anies said he would prioritise increasing co-operation with countries in the European Union and East Asia over co-operation with China.\nAt the same event Ganjar expressed his desire to continue projects initiated by President Widodo's government, including investment co-operation with China.\n3. Nickel\nAustralia and Indonesia have a converging interest in the emerging electric vehicle supply chain. Indonesia, which has centuries of experience in managing a rising China, would like to tap into Australia's stores of lithium, so it is not totally reliant on China for supply. It hopes to one day be shipping EVs made in Indonesia to Australia.\nThis year these discussions have been overshadowed by Indonesia's controversial nickel policies. Chinese investors have worked with Indonesia to expand downstream operations and the nation's exports of processed ore have shot up. Indonesia now supplies half of all the world's nickel, and it could get to 75 per cent.\nMeanwhile, Australian nickel mines are shutting, slammed by the inexorable laws of supply and demand that have pushed nickel prices down about 50 per cent in the past 12 months.\nNickel has now become an election issue in Indonesia after the vice presidential candidate on the Anies ticket criticised government decrees that he claims - and most of the world agrees - have come at a high environmental cost with questionable economic benefits.\nIn a campaign visit to the nickel-rich region of North Maluku, Anies said local communities had not benefited from the double-digit economic growth recorded for the district. \"The mineral wealth needs to be utilised and managed fairly to become a capital for the development of North Maluku in the future.\" The Anies side has also suggested most of the profits from Indonesia's \"nickel rush\" have gone to Chinese investors.\nIn response, ministers in the government slammed the premise that Indonesia was not getting a good return on its exports of processed ore. \"Even though our production has increased quite significantly, that doesn't mean our income has decreased.\"\nThe Prabowo camp, which sees an electoral advantage in promising to do the same as Jokowi, has vowed to continue all elements of his downstreaming program. Ganjar would do the same.\nThe controversy taps into deep-seated views on economic nationalism in Indonesia that reflect its colonial past. After three centuries of watching the Dutch help themselves to the archipelago's natural resources, Indonesians emerged after a four-year war of independence determined to use these resources to propel national prosperity. \n4. Skilled workers\nIndonesia is undoubtedly a big economy, but until recently, it has struggled to exploit its scale by creating a class of entrepreneurs or making itself an attractive target for foreign investors. It now has a thriving tech sector and foreign investment has increased - though it has stiff competition from regional neighbours like Vietnam and Thailand.\nThe nation needs all of this and more if it is to reach its often-articulated goal of becoming a high-income country in created_at for its 100th anniversary in 2045. That requires increasing its current gross national income per person of $US4580 ($7020) to $US13,846, according to World Bank metrics.\nTo get there, Indonesia needs to produce an educated, skilled workforce and attract and develop industries that will produce jobs for them. Polls show this is a huge focus for voters, particularly given one-third of eligible voters haven't hit 30 yet.\nThere is a big opportunity for Australia to build on the presence of Monash University Indonesia - the only foreign-owned university in the country - to help educate the millions entering the workforce each year. There is also interest in worker exchange with Indonesians coming into Australia to fill job vacancies in sectors such as nursing and childcare.\nEconomists say foreign investment is necessary if Indonesia is to maintain or better yet, improve on 5 per cent annual GDP growth. Anies is the candidate most willing to facilitate investment from countries other than China, but Australian institutions will have to stump up funds - and so far, they have not been forthcoming.\nOne insider says Jokowi resents criticism that he has favoured Chinese companies to build infrastructure and nickel smelters. The president's position is that when it's only Chinese companies that are prepared to fund a build, he has had no choice. Ganjar has indicated he intends to follow this lead.\nThe argument over nickel is also a test of whether Indonesia's young voters are happy to stick with the economic nationalism policies that mean government ownership features in most aspects of the economy - or are convinced by the more pro-markets approach favoured by Anies who is more inclined towards broadening Indonesia's source of foreign investment by appealing to OECD countries.\n5. A political dynasty that could threaten democracy\nAsia is full of political dynasties and this election could see the start of a new one in Indonesia, given one of the three vice presidential candidates, Gibran Rakabuming, is the son of the current president Jokowi.\nThe Gibran factor has been one of the main talking points of this election. That, and the fact that Jokowi appears to have split from the party that backed him in his two election wins in 2014 and 2019. So far, the president hasn't openly endorsed Prabowo (his son's running mate), but he has said that he is entitled to have a view and there is speculation he will come out and back Prabowo before campaigning wraps up this week.\nEarly on in its decade-long rule, Jokowi said he did not want to start a political dynasty. Now two of his sons and a son-in-law are in politics. It is perhaps not surprising that Jokowi changed his mind. After all, since independence in 1945, Indonesian politics has been dominated by powerful families.\nPolls show up to 80 per cent of Indonesians approve of the job Jokowi has been doing after a decade as president, and this long-standing popularity could bode well for the Prabowo/ Gibran ticket. \nPrabowo is ahead in the polls to become the country's next president, despite credible accusations of human rights violations in the past.\nMany fear a Prabowo win could set the country on a slippery slope. If Jokowi continues to exercise influence after exiting the palace, there are concerns this could weaken democracy in the country to the point where it shuts down. This is what happened in 1957, just eight years after Indonesia won its hard-fought battle for independence.\nOthers believe Indonesia's institutions - its courts, its parliament, and its very active civil society - are strong enough to counter this threat.\nAustralia, which has a vested interest in a prosperous and peaceful Indonesia, has to hope the optimists will be proved right. \n"

    "title": "HOW SHOULD EUROPE HANDLE CHINA?: ANNUAL REPORT 2023",
    "created_at": "2024-02-13",
    "text": "\nLondon: Centre for European Reform has issued the following press release:\nHow the EU deals with China will have a profound effect on the sort of economic and geopolitical entity that the Union becomes in the mid-21st century. China is the world ’ s largest economy, measured at purchasing power parity, and the EU ’ s number one trading partner. It accounts for about 30 per cent of global carbon emissions. And it is a weighty military and diplomatic power, building a conventional and nuclear arsenal that will challenge the US ’ s position as the pre-eminent security actor in the Indo-Pacific region.How is EU policy towards China evolving? How do the Chinese view the EU? Does it make sense for the US and the EU to work together on China, and is there scope for them to do so? Can the Europeans influence China ’ s actions? Are the British closer to the US or the EU on China? And how will changes within China affect Europe ’ s relationship with it?\nIn the early years of this century, many Europeans had quite warm feelings about China. There seemed to be a real possibility that it would become more liberal, not only economically, but even politically. When China joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001 there was a broad consensus among Western leaders on Wandel durch Handel – that trade changes countries for the better. But the Europeans have gradually become disillusioned with China, particularly over the past ten years or so, for three main sets of reasons.\nEuropeans have given up hope that China will play by the rules on trade and investment. They accuse it of stealing intellectual property, denying Europeans reciprocal market access, using excessive amounts of state aid to help its firms take over European ones or win contracts at the expense of European competitors, and much else. The EU argues that a big reason for its trade deficit with China – almost €400 billion in 2022 compared to €165 billion in 2019 – is that China closes its markets much more than the EU does.Human rights have always been a source of tension between the EU and China, notably because of repression in Tibet. But the crackdown on Hong Kong in 2020, with the National Security Law effectively ending the territory ’ s ‘one country, two systems ’ model of governance, upset many Europeans. So did the situation in Xinjiang, where reports emerged of the persecution of Uyghurs – and of some Western companies profiting from the exploitation of Uyghur labour.China has become much more assertive, geopolitically. It has raised the stakes in its dispute with Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, displayed increasing amounts of military force near Taiwan, built artificial militarised islands to reinforce its claims in the South China Sea and sanctioned Lithuania for allowing Taiwan to open a representative office in Vilnius. Above all, China has given diplomatic support to Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, and helped the Russian economy to weather sanctions by stepping up purchases of Russian oil and gas. Chinese firms are quietly helping Russia to get around Western export controls by supplying machine tools and components that are no longer available from Germany or the US.The Chinese are all for creating divisions between the EU and the US.\nTweet thisIn 2019, the EU approved a strategy document declaring that China was at the same created_at a partner, competitor and systemic rival. The EU has maintained that triad since then, but now places more emphasis on the systemic rivalry. China ’ s handling of the Covid virus in 2020 did not help its relations with the EU: its government refused to accept international scrutiny, would not take any criticism and sought to blame others for the pandemic.\nIn December 2020 China and the EU agreed on the text of a ‘Comprehensive Agreement on Investment ’ , to facilitate investment between them. Germany ’ s then chancellor, Angela Merkel, pushed strongly for the treaty. But then the EU sanctioned certain Chinese individuals because of what they had done in Xinjiang, which led Beijing to impose extensive counter-sanctions against MEPs, European officials and think-tanks. As a result, the European Parliament refused to ratify the treaty, greatly annoying the Chinese.\nMeanwhile Europeans have become increasingly worried about their dependency on China for green technologies, such as solar panels and electric vehicle batteries, as well as for many rare earths. Yet in order to make a success of its transition to a low-carbon economy, Europe needs large quantities of China ’ s relatively cheap green goods.\nIn the past few years, the EU has passed a swathe of legislation designed to counter China ’ s economic threat, including rules on the screening of inbound investments, the unfair use of state aid in the acquisition of EU firms, the lack of reciprocity in procurement, and the need to encourage the mining and production of critical raw materials within the EU. The EU has also agreed on an ‘anti-coercion instrument ’ , so that it can more easily retaliate against a country that unfairly punishes a member-state (as in the case of China and Lithuania).\nIn formal terms, none of these measures is China-specific. In practice they are largely about China. They also reflect French thinking on industrial policy and on the need for European strategic autonomy. The French line that the EU should reduce its dependencies on China (and other countries) is increasingly shared by other member-states. Hence the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, talks of ‘de-risking ’ relations with China – a phrase that Joe Biden ’ s administration has copied.\nIt is worth considering how China ’ s leaders view the EU. They spend much more created_at thinking about the US, with which they are obsessed, and they often view the EU through the prism of their relationship with the US. They are somecreated_ats paranoid about the Americans and fear their power. They know that the US ’ s system of alliances – with friends in Europe and East Asia – is one of the sources of its strength. So, the Chinese are all for creating divisions between the EU and the US. Ever since the then leaders of France and Germany, Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder, talked about a multipolar world some 20 years ago, the Chinese have hoped for one – and they have not given up dreaming that the Europeans will help to create such a world.\nYet Chinese leaders see that the Europeans have hardened their line on China – and they blame this on the Americans ’ bullying of Europeans. There is a small amount of truth in this thesis: the UK and several other European countries are ripping Huawei equipment out of their 5G systems because of American pressure. The Americans have also pushed the Commission to come up with an ‘economic security strategy ’ which is largely directed against China (see below). But the main reason why the Europeans ’ attitudes have hardened is that they do not like what the Chinese do to help their companies, or their foreign policy or their human rights record.\nThere are of course divisions among the Europeans. At one end of the spectrum, Hungary often vetoes any criticism of China. At the other end are the Nordic and Baltic countries – and Lithuania in particular – which care the most about human rights, as well as the security of small countries that are close to a powerful neighbour (such as Taiwan or themselves). France and Germany are in the middle, but leaning to the softer end of the spectrum.\nGermany, perhaps inevitably given its ties of trade and investment, is usually softer than France. Chancellor Olaf Scholz intervened personally in 2022 to ensure that China ’ s COSCO could buy a stake in part of Hamburg port. But France is more unpredictable. In April 2023 President Emmanuel Macron told journalists while flying back from Beijing that Europe should not get caught up in a crisis over Taiwan involving the US and China. Europe should develop its own strategic autonomy rather than become a vassal of the US, he said. These comments upset the US as well as quite a few EU governments. Yet while Macron was in China, a French frigate sailed through the Taiwan Strait – waters that China argues foreign warships have no right to transit without its permission.\nChina ’ s behaviour has helped to make the Europeans somewhat less divided in recent years. The ‘16+1 process ’ , which involved Chinese leaders regularly meeting their Central and East European counterparts (from both EU and non-EU countries), and offering favours such as investments, made it harder to forge a common line among the 27 member-states. But over the past few years many of the Central and East Europeans have lost interest in the 16+1 process, and it has now petered out.\nReflecting the general hardening of the European position, in 2023 Italy quit China ’ s Belt and Road Initiative and Germany adopted a new China strategy. That document stated that China could impinge on Germany ’ s security interests as well as its economic interests, and it called for de-risking, to reduce Germany ’ s dependencies on China. The foreign ministry, controlled by the Green party, led on the strategy, but Scholz – concerned to protect the interests of the big car and chemical companies that are heavily invested in China – intervened to soften the language.\nMost EU governments now agree on the broad thrust of China policy – that China should do more to open its markets, perform better on human rights and give less support to Russia in its war with Ukraine. But there are still divisions. Von der Leyen is at the harder end of the European spectrum. Influenced by the Biden administration, in June 2023 she got the Commission to adopt a document called the economic security strategy. This called for controls on the exports of sensitive technologies (similar to controls already introduced by the US) as well as the screening of outbound investments that could lead to the transfer of sensitive technologies.\nGermany and several other countries thought the economic security strategy went too far, both in substance and in giving the EU competence over matters better left to member-states. The arguments over the Commission ’ s proposals will continue, amidst pressure from Washington. The US has already convinced the Dutch to ban the chipmaker ASML from selling cutting-edge lithography equipment to China, and even persuaded the company to stop shipping machines ahead of the export restriction deadline.\nTHE EU, THE US AND CHINAUnfortunately for Beijing, relations between the Biden administration and the EU concerning China are quite good. Biden and his officials have made much more of an effort than the Trump administration to consult the EU on China policy, and they have a good relationship with von der Leyen and her team. It helps that the Europeans have stiffened their line on China in recent years.\nNevertheless, there will always be transatlantic tensions over how to handle China, because the EU and the US have differing interests and attitudes. The Europeans ’ main concern is over China ’ s behaviour: if it respected human rights better, stopped stealing intellectual property and did not bully its neighbours, they would be happy to have a close relationship. The US, by contrast, is concerned about China ’ s power per se, seeing it as a geopolitical rival in East Asia. Even if China behaved better, many Americans would still worry about Chinese power. In short, the US worries more about what China is, and the EU more about what China does.\nUnderpinning these different approaches are differing interests. The EU depends more on trade with China than the US does: its imports and exports of goods amounted to 5.4 per cent of GDP in 2022, against 2.7 per cent for the US. The German economy is particularly tied to that of China: The Economist has estimated that about 10 per cent of German GDP depends either on exports to, or investments in, China.\nIt would be unfair to say that Europe ignores the geopolitics of East Asia: Britain, France and Germany have recently sent warships to the seas close to China, France declares itself a Pacific power on the basis of its territories in that ocean, the UK has ‘tilted ’ to the Indo-Pacific through its AUKUS military pact with the US and Australia, and Josep Borrell, the EU ’ s foreign policy chief, raises geopolitical issues when in Beijing.\nBut most Europeans, most of the created_at, think mainly about their commercial interests in East Asia. Their closer economic ties would make them more reluctant than the US to decouple from China economically in a crisis. America, in contrast, has to plan for the possibility of fighting a war with China over Taiwan. Hence the US is much more concerned about the export of advanced technologies that could be used in Chinese weapons systems.\nThe worse the relationship between the US and China, the harder it is for Europeans to maintain a line that is significantly different from the Americans ’ . In a crisis that involved the use of force, the Europeans would cleave to the Americans, drawn by their common values as well as their economic and financial interdependence. If a war began, the EU would provide diplomatic support and probably sanction China – although few member-states would want to offer military aid.\nWhat if Donald Trump returned to the White House? A second Trump presidency would not alter the fact that Europeans have much more in common with the US than with China. But it would create tensions among Europeans. Many of them would follow the Macronian line that Europe needs to develop its strategic autonomy, independently of the US or anyone else. Others might seek to work closely with Trump and/or – if he devalued NATO ’ s security guarantee – seek an accommodation with Russia. All in all, Europe could well be more divided that it is today, and transatlantic relations would probably be more antagonistic. That would suit China fine.\nCAN EUROPE INFLUENCE CHINA?For a country or entity that aspires to be a serious geopolitical actor, the point of having a foreign policy is to make the world a bit more aligned with one ’ s interests and values than it would otherwise be. Given that most European states share similar if not identical interests towards China, and subscribe to similar values, and given that they are all small compared with China, it makes sense for them to team up when they deal with the country. On certain issues it is also sensible for them to combine with other like-minded states, such as Japan, Australia, South Korea, the UK or indeed the US. Stronger combinations should in theory increase the Europeans ’ leverage over China.\nYet it seems questionable whether the Europeans have much leverage. They have plenty of meetings with the Chinese: six European commissioners went to Beijing in the autumn of 2023; there are regular EU-China dialogues on geopolitics, human rights, trade, climate, energy and digital issues; and in December von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, met Chinese leaders in Beijing. But those taking part in these meetings admit they do not appear to achieve a great deal. The Chinese tend to listen politely but not shift their stance. Take China ’ s trade surplus, which Europeans frequently raise with the Chinese. The Chinese say that it stems from their economy being competitive, rather than non-tariff barriers to trade.\nNevertheless, EU diplomats claim they do somecreated_ats have a bit of influence on the Chinese. In the summer of 2023, the EU was preparing to sanction a group of Chinese companies that were helping Russian companies to evade Western sanctions. Before publishing the list of the companies, EU diplomats had a quiet word with Chinese officials, who undertook to sort out the problem with several of the companies concerned, and apparently did so.\nAnother example of European influence could be Scholz ’ s visit to Beijing in November 2022. He urged President Xi Jinping to caution Russia ’ s leaders not to use nuclear weapons, and Xi said that the international community should oppose their threat or use. Thereafter Putin talked much less about nuclear weapons. Xi might well have said what he said anyway, but the timing was linked to Scholz ’ s visit. Similarly, shortly after Macron met Xi in April 2023, the Chinese president telephoned Ukraine ’ s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, having not previously spoken to him. Macron claimed the credit but Xi might have called Zelenskyy anyway.\nIf the Europeans can be united, focused and tough, they have two main sorts of potential leverage with the Chinese. One is economic. An open European market is hugely important for Chinese exports and investment. As described earlier in this essay, the EU has passed several laws that can be directed against unfair Chinese economic practices. The Commission ’ s recent announcement of an investigation into the subsidies aiding China ’ s exports of electric vehicles suggests that Brussels might be willing to start using some of its economic leverage.\nIn the long run the EU ’ s economic security strategy may give it additional levers to use against the Chinese. Whether the Chinese respond to a harder EU approach by making concessions or retaliating remains to be seen. The US ’ s imposition of high-tech export controls has already led to China restricting its exports of gallium, germanium and graphite, three essential ingredients of many green technologies and semiconductors.\nThe second sort of potential leverage is political. The Chinese do not want to see the EU align closely with the US. That is why they still make efforts to cultivate European leaders – for example treating Macron like a king during his visit, and willingly hosting a stream of commissioners from Brussels. They keep hearing from European visitors that their tacit support for Russia over Ukraine is harming their image in Europe – even if they show no signs of abandoning Putin.\nBut does Xi really understand that China ’ s own actions are the main factor pushing the EU closer to the US? One senior German diplomat doubted that he did, because he is surrounded by people who tell him what he wants to hear. “What we need is an EU-China summit involving not just the EU institutions but all the heads of government,” said the diplomat. “Then they could be sure to get the message directly to Xi, that the shift in our position is a consequence of Chinese behaviour. ” It is not clear how the EU can use its political leverage most effectively, given the supreme self-confidence of China ’ s leaders; they do not have an inferiority complex vis-à-vis Europe.\nCHANGE IN CHINALike the EU, China is not a fixed and stable entity. It is always evolving, and as far as the EU is concerned, many recent changes have been for the worse. When the CER began to publish papers on China, in the early years of this century, there were multiple voices in the Chinese system, and competing centres of power. Some prominent intellectuals argued that the government should gain a degree of independence from the Chinese Communist Party. But over the past ten or 15 years China has become more centralised and autocratic, under the party ’ s firm control. People are afraid to say things that could appear critical of Xi. Given that democratic values are an important part of Europe ’ s identity, European leaders naturally regret this evolution within China.\nThe other change in recent years is that China ’ s economy seems to be weakening. The ageing of the population, the high levels of youth unemployment, the property crash, the harassment of some foreign firms in China, the reduction of foreign direct investment and the general prioritisation of security at the expense of the interests of the private sector have all taken their toll. Some economists think that China ’ s true rate of growth may be substantially less that the official figures (3 per cent in 2022 and 5 per cent in 2023), in which case its economy may struggle to surpass that of the US, measured by market exchange rates.\nChina ’ s economic problems probably explain why in late 2023 Xi adopted a soft tone at his summits with EU leaders in Beijing and with Joe Biden near San Francisco. To Biden, in particular, he offered real concessions, such as the restoration of military-to-military contacts and the banning of the export of the chemicals that make the harmful drug fentanyl. PresumablyXi did not want greater tensions with theWest to create stronger headwinds for the Chinese economy.\nHowever, the indications are that China ’ s leaders think the current economic problems are a short-term blip rather than the start of a long-term malaise. So they have not shifted their policies significantly. They still think that China is rising and that the West is decadent, divided and declining.\nWhatever the prospects for the Chinese economy, the middle decades of the 21st century seem likely to feature an intense rivalry between two competing geopolitical teams: China, Russia, Iran and their friends, against the US, Europe and their allies. Many European and, probably, Chinese leaders would regret such a scenario. There are European diplomats who hope that the EU can use its relatively good relations with Beijing, and its close ties to Washington, to help to lower tensions between the two superpowers. Let us hope that such diplomats are right, but we should not count on it.\nAt the moment EU policy on China is probably about right. It would be better for Europe, economically, for there to be no new cold war. In a cold war or even worse, a hot war, Europe would have to line up beside the US, and accept at least partial economic decoupling from China, at considerable cost. So the Europeans need to use such influence as they have to reduce the chances of this split-world scenario. The message that all European leaders need to give their Chinese counterparts, again and again, is that if they want to avoid pushing Europe into an American embrace, they need to stop doing some of the things that turn Europeans against them. The Europeans can also point out to the Chinese that if they took such steps, it would curb the hostility of some Americans towards China.\nCharles Grant, director, Centre for European Reform\nTHE CER IN 2023In a dark and troubled year, Russia held its ground in its war against Ukraine, China and Iran aided Russia, and Hamas attacked Israel, provoking a savage response. The global efforts to forge a new agreement to curb climate change were unconvincing. The world ’ s economy was morose, and the pushback against globalisation did not help it. Meanwhile Donald Trump seemed to have a fair chance of regaining the US presidency in 2024 – an event which would surely undermine Western unity.What a contrast with 1998, the year when the CER opened its first office! Then we considered questions like: Will Britain join the euro? Will Russia become a proper democracy? Will China become more liberal and accept the rule of law? Is the spread of market economics unstoppable? And how soon will Israel and Palestine agree to a ‘two-state solution ’ ?\nAnd yet even in 2023 there were pockets of brightness: Britain and the EU reached a less conflictual modus operandi, the Poles ejected a government which had seriously undermined the rule of law and the EU seemed to be getting serious – at least in theory – about a major round of enlargement. The CER itself was in fine shape – and busy, with 57 publications, 40 events and 23 podcasts.\nAbove (L to R):Charles Grant and Josep Borrell FontellesConference on 'Europe and the world' followed by CER birthday reception, Brussels\nWe enjoyed two celebrations of our 25th birthday. The first was a conference hosted by Microsoft in Brussels in October on ‘Europe and the world ’ . The event concluded with my interviewing Josep Borrell Fontelles, the EU ’ s foreign policy chief, in a wide-ranging conversation covering China, Ukraine and Gaza. Faced with the prospect of a new cold war between the Western allies, on the one side, and China, Russia and their friends on the other, Borrell argued against bipolarity. “We have to accept a multipolar world, yet the more multipolar it becomes, the less multilateral it is,” he lamented. “If there are more players, you need more rules. ”\nWe also held a party in London in November, hosted by the Spanish ambassador and featuring Michael Gove, the British levelling up secretary, as the speaker. Some of our friends asked why we had asked a Tory Brexiteer to be the guest of honour. The answer is that we like to alternate between the political parties at birthday celebrations, and we had had Labour leader Keir Starmer at our 24th birthday party. We also think it important to engage with those with whom we disagree. And we did not complain when this most experienced of Conservative ministers said that CER stood for Consistently Excellent Research.\nIn February, in issue 148 of the CER ’ s bulletin, we published articles by Nick Butler and David Miliband, the CER ’ s founders, recalling how they had set it up, and another piece by Heather Grabbe, remembering what it was like to be a researcher in our early years. I added my own reminiscences of the early years in an article in issue 150 of the bulletin, in May.\nThat was in fact the final issue of the bulletin. Given that all our publications are accessible online, it no longer made sense to publish three short articles in a single format every two months. Instead, we are publishing more of our slightly longer ‘insights ’ . But the archive of our 150 bulletins remains a fascinating commentary of the European Union ’ s evolution over the past 25 years.\nThere were some other changes at the CER in 2023, the biggest of which was the departure of John Springford in November. He was a key member of our economics team for ten years, and deputy director for the last five of those. His contribution to the CER was enormous – for example his work on the cost of Brexit to the UK economy (of which more below). He is starting a new venture of his own, but happily for us John remains an associate fellow and will still be working a day a week at the CER.\nIan Bond has become the CER ’ s deputy director and Zach Meyers has become assistant director. Aslak Berg, who formerly worked for the European Free Trade Association and the Norwegian government, has joined our economics team. Meanwhile Octavia Hughes has joined the CER ’ s admin team and has also taken on the production of our podcasts. We said goodbye to Helmi Pillai, the 2022-23 Clara Marina O ’ Donnell fellow, and welcomed Christina Keßler as the 2023-24 fellow. Christina is the tenth holder of this fellowship, set up to commemorate our much-missed defence analyst, who died in January 2014.\nOur advisory board was strengthened by the arrival of James Anderson, a senior figure from the fund management industry. Chris Haskins stepped down after many years of service on the board.\nTURNING THE CORNER IN UK-EU RELATIONSFor six and a half years after the Brexit referendum, relations between London and the EU varied between being somewhat tetchy and downright acrimonious. In 2023 they improved substantially. The arrival of Rishi Sunak as British prime minister in October 2022 was a gamechanger. Though no europhile – he voted to leave the EU – he brought a measure of calmness and civility to relations with Brussels and the member-states.\nAfter the Brexit referendum, relations between London and the EU varied between somewhat tetchy and downright acrimonious.\nTweet thisLed by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, EU leaders were willing to compromise over the Northern Ireland protocol. The geopolitical context helped: given the Russian threat to European security, it was evidently desirable to removea major irritant between the UK and its erstwhile partners.\nBecause Northern Ireland remains aligned with EU single market rules for goods, the protocol – signed by then prime minister Boris Johnson in October 2019 – required the UK to control goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This created practical difficulties for many people in Northern Ireland – and threatened the identity of some unionists, who do not want any controls to separate them from rest of the UK. The ‘Windsor Framework ’ that von der Leyen and Sunak signed in February reduced those border checks to a minimum, at least on goods destined to go no further than Northern Ireland. The new framework satisfied the EU and most British Conservatives, though not (at least in 2023) the hard-line unionists of the Democratic Unionist Party. We considered the legal implications of the protocol in a podcast with Professor Catherine Barnard of Cambridge University.\nThe Windsor Framework created a better atmosphere between London and Brussels, which subsequently contributed to the UK rejoining the Horizon programme of scientific research, signing a memorandum of understanding on financial services regulation, and striking an accord with Frontex, the EU ’ s border agency. Speaking at a CER breakfast in May, Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris – a veteran campaigner for Brexit – talked about the EU in very positive terms.\nAbove (L to R):Chris Heaton-Harris and Charles GrantBreakfast on 'Reflections on the Northern Ireland protocol and the UK's relationship with the EU', London\nBut there were limits to how far the bonhomie could go. As I explained in an insight, published just after the Windsor Framework was signed, the Conservative Party remains profoundly eurosceptic. I drew attention to the nonsensical Retained EU Law (or REUL) Bill, which, if implemented, would have required the government to do the impossible and amend, retain or scrap some 4,000 to 5,000 pieces of EU law on the statute book, by the end of 2023.\nI also highlighted the persistent Conservative trope of arguing that migration can only be controlled if the UK leaves the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). This upset EU leaders, because the Good Friday Agreement (which brought peace to Northern Ireland) and significant parts of the Trade and Co-operation Agreement (the TCA, which defined the post-Brexit trading relationship) are predicated on the UK accepting the ECHR.\nIn an insight in April, Anton Spisak, then a researcher at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, argued that the REUL Bill was incompatible with the Windsor Framework. Perhaps someone in the government read the piece, because shortly afterwards it announced a significant watering down of the bill.\nBut talk about leaving the ECHR and other treaties which could constrain the executive only grew. About 70 per cent of Tory members want to quit the ECHR, according to opinion polls. That the hardliners had succeeded in firing up the party ’ s base was evident at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, where we held two fringe events. At one of these, interestingly, former minister and leading Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom MP said she opposed leaving the ECHR. She and fellow-panellists Bim Afolami – who became a minister shortly after our event – and EU ambassador Pedro Serrano all said that the TCA was a good deal for the UK. But another panellist, the Financial created_ats ’ Brexit guru Peter Foster, disagreed, citing case after case of companies which were struggling to cope with the post-Brexit trading arrangements.\nBREXIT HURTSThe economic costs of Brexit for the UK mounted. In an insight published in January, John Springford and Jonathan Portes, a professor at King's College London, examined the impact of Brexit on the UK labour market. They concluded that by June 2022, the end of free movement had led to 460,000 EU workers leaving the UK. The arrival of an extra 130,000 workers from other parts of the world only partially compensated, leaving a net loss of 330,000. The labour shortages mainly affected sectors employing low-skilled workers, such as transport, storage, hospitality, construction, wholesale and retail.\nJohn continued his series of studies on the impact of Brexit on the UK ’ s GDP. He constructed a doppelgänger UK, based on a group of countries that had similar characteristics to the UK but had not experienced Brexit. In an insight published in May, comparing the UK ’ s performance with that of its doppelgänger, he found that by the second quarter of 2022 the UK had taken a hit of 5.5 per cent of GDP. John ’ s figures are roughly in line with other serious attempts to quantify the cost of Brexit, including that of the government ’ s own Office of Budget Responsibility.\nLabour is unwilling to speak a lot about Europe, or too positively about it.\nTweet thisGiven these significant costs, unsurprisingly, there has been a lot of talk about whether the TCA can be improved. In particular, many people have asked whether a Labour government – which seems likely to take office in 2024 – would try to revise Johnson ’ s Brexit deal.\nThe Commission and many member-states are in no hurry to revisit the TCA. They think it works well and emphasise that the review of the treaty which is due in 2026 is simply a review of its implementation rather than an opportunity for making fundamental changes. That was the message of a panel that we held in March, involving Stefaan de Rynck, a senior Commission official who had helped to negotiate the TCA, Iain Martin, a leading eurosceptic commentator, Ivan Rogers, a former UK permanent representative to the EU, and Catherine Barnard.\nAnton Spisak took a similar line in another piece that he wrote for the CER in September. He pointed out that even the Labour Party ’ s modest proposals for closer co-operation on security policy, improved mobility for workers on short-term visits to the EU, and the recognition of EU standards on plant and animal health, would require either new treaties or new chapters in the TCA.\nBut given that Labour has prioritised boosting the UK ’ s growth rate, would it not seek more ambitious changes to the existing relationship with the EU? Labour leader Keir Starmer has set down three red lines: no return to the single market or the customs union and no restoration of freedom of movement. Labour is unwilling to speak a lot about Europe, or too positively about it, lest it remind Leave voters of their Leaver identity so that they end up voting Tory rather than switching to Labour.\nSo a succession of Labour speakers at CER events took a very cautious approach. Bill Esterson, the shadow business minister speaking at a roundtable in June, Nick Thomas-Symonds, Keir Starmer ’ s Brexit supremo speaking at a breakfast in September, and Stephen Doughty, the shadow Europe minister speaking on a panel also in September, each avoided going into detail on how they would improve the Brexit deal. At the September panel many pro-Europeans in the audience – and fellow panellist Peter Foster – gave Doughty a hard created_at for avoiding specifics. The same dynamic emerged at our fringe meeting at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, where shadow Northern Ireland secretary Hilary Benn and former minister Douglas Alexander defended a modest approach to revising the TCA, while Stella Creasy MP and many of the audience wanted greater boldness.\nAbove (L to R):Charles Grant, Stephen Doughty, Catherine Barnard and Peter FosterRoundtable on 'The Labour Party's approach to the EU', London\nIn September I published a policy brief, ‘A European strategy for Labour ’ , which sought to explore ways of getting closer to the EU while respecting Starmer ’ s red lines. I suggested that Labour should work on restoring trust between the UK and the EU ’ s institutions and governments. Then a Labour government should unilaterally make alignment with EU laws on business regulation its default position – and be willing to accept some sort of role for the European Court of Justice. Labour should also make an offer to the EU, which could include a security partnership, an energy partnership, budgetary contributions to the EU ’ s development and neighbourhood policies, more people-to-people contacts and collaboration on helping to rebuild Ukraine.\nThe EU could then see a mutual benefit in offering the UK a unique partnership that would allow a much closer economic relationship than it has offered other third countries. The more challenging the geopolitical environment, the stronger the case for deepening ties. Reviewing this policy brief in a CER podcast, former Labour leader Neil Kinnock said that he hoped Labour ’ s leaders would raise the level of their ambition on Europe.\nCharles Grant\nNAVIGATING A WORLD OF CONFLICTRussia ’ s war on Ukraine and Europe ’ s response dominated our work on European security. In January, Ian Bond published the first of what became a series of warnings that the West ’ s aid to Ukraine was too little and was being delivered too slowly. He also highlighted a theme that would grow in importance: the rise in isolationism among Republicans in the US.\nIn February, a year after Russia ’ s large-scale invasion, the CER held an event on the situation in Ukraine with Lawrence Freedman, Emeritus Professor of War Studies at King's College London; Timothy Garton Ash, Professor of European Studies at the University of Oxford; Olesya Khromeychuk, Director of the Ukrainian Institute London; Iuliia Osmolovska, Director of the Kyiv Office of GLOBSEC; and Richard Shirreff, the former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe at NATO. Olesya and Richard also recorded a podcast for us on the war.\nAt the same created_at we published a comprehensive – and, as it turned out, over-optimistic – analysis of the impact of the war on Europe. Ukraine, now a candidate for EU membership, had repelled Russia ’ s invasion and was inflicting significant costs on Russia. NATO had been revived in its role of providing deterrence against Russia. Europeans were also taking defence more seriously and the EU was playing a significant role, co-ordinating economic aid to Ukraine and helping supply it with weapons. Europeans had managed to reduce their dependency on Russian gas drastically, but that had led to a rise in energy prices and inflation. We argued that the EU needed to redouble its efforts to reduce energy consumption and to invest in renewables.\nIn March we held another in our geopolitical risk series of CER/AIG webinars on ‘What will Putin do next, and how should the West respond? ’ . Ian chaired a discussion with Per Brodersen of the German Eastern Business Association; Sergey Radchenko of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies; Thilo Schroeter of the German foreign ministry and Angela Stent of Georgetown University. Among the key points: Putin had correctly judged that China and the ‘global south ’ would not be willing to reduce economic or political ties in response to his invasion; and there was no sign of Putin changing his aims, which remained the subjugation of Ukraine and the overthrow of the pre-war European security order.\nAlso in March, Finland joined NATO after Turkey dropped objections to its membership. A month earlier in an insight Helmi Pillai had said that Finland should join the alliance without waiting for Sweden. In her final piece as the 2022-23 Clara Marina O ’ Donnell fellow, Helmi wrote about the hybrid threat from Russia to Europe ’ s critical infrastructure, and urged other European countries to follow the examples of Finland and Sweden in taking a ‘whole of society ’ approach to resilience.\nWe were in Berlin in May for the biannual Daimler Forum, which the CER organises with the Brookings Institution and the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, and which brings together government officials and think-tankers to discuss global challenges. Speakers at the forum included Andreas Michelis, then state secretary, Tjorven Bellmann, political director, and Tobias Lindner, minister of state, all from the German foreign ministry; Christian Turner, political director at the UK foreign office; Xavier Chatel, strategic affairs adviser at the Elysée; Rebecca Lissner, deputy national security adviser to the US vice president; and Rachel Ellehuus, the Pentagon ’ s representative at NATO. The Germans were pessimistic about the likelihood of Ukrainian battlefield success and about the sustainability of public support for Ukraine. Later in the month at a lunch in Brussels we heard from Julianne Smith, US Ambassador to NATO, on the impact of the war on the alliance and its priorities.\nUS and European officials expressed growing worries about the possible impact of Trump returning to the White House.\nTweet thisIn July, the issue of Ukrainian membership of NATO was one of the main issues on leaders ’ agendas when they met in Vilnius. Ian argued that, even before the end of the conflict, it would be the best way to guarantee Ukraine ’ s security, though he acknowledged that the summit would offer Kyiv much less than immediate membership. Luigi Scazzieri proposed that, if leaders wanted to support Kyiv and reinforce deterrence, they needed to build up their industrial capacity and strengthen the European pillar of the alliance. On the eve of the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London, Timothy Ash of Chatham House and Ian tackled the problem of how to use frozen Russian state assets to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine. Sander Tordoir, Zach Meyers and Camino Mortera-Martínez have also been involved in a project advising the Commission on how to use frozen Russian assets for the reconstruction of Ukraine.\nAs Ukraine ’ s summer offensive became bogged down, more people, including Ukraine ’ s top military commander Andriy Zaluzhniy, began to talk about stalemate. In November we hosted Iuliia Osmolovska again for a discussion on ‘War, peace and the future of Ukraine ’ . She said that despite the lack of recent military success, the resolve of the Ukrainians to keep fighting remained undiminished. She also talked movingly about the problem of soldiers who had returned from the front alive but suffering from severe psychological trauma. In the same month Ian published a policy brief on the dangers of ‘Ukraine fatigue ’ in the West, in which he argued that the EU needed to ensure that its fiscal rules did not get in the way of increased defence spending, and that the Union should not be so squeamish about confiscating frozen Russian assets and using them to repair the damage Russia has inflicted on Ukraine.\nThe Daimler Forum met again in Washington at the end of November. Speakers included MEP Rados aw Sikorski, shortly before his appointment as Poland ’ s foreign minister; Christian Turner; Manuel Lafont Rapnouil, head of policy planning in the French foreign ministry; historian Robert Kagan; Amanda Sloat, who had just stepped down as senior director for Europe in the US National Security Council (NSC); Thomas Bagger, state secretary at the German foreign ministry; Tom Wright, senior director for strategic planning in the NSC; Enrique Mora, the EU ’ s political director; Salman Ahmed, director of policy planning in the State Department; and Tarun Chhabra, senior director for technology and national security in the NSC. By the created_at the forum met, Republican isolationists in Congress were blocking further US aid to Ukraine, while the administration was still holding back on giving Ukraine the long-range missiles and other weapons that it needed to launch a successful military offensive and recapture occupied territory. As well as Ukraine the forum focused on the ‘global south ’ , the strategic implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the war in the Middle East.\nAs the year progressed, US and European officials expressed growing worries about the possible impact of Donald Trump returning to the White House. Many of them thought transatlantic and European unity could easily be undermined. In September, Mark Gitenstein, US ambassador to the EU, tried to be more optimistic, speaking at one of our Kreab-hosted breakfasts in Brussels. He emphasised the extent of common ground between the EU and the US, particularly in responding to Russia ’ s war against Ukraine. Another glass half-full approach came from Stefano Sannino, the secretary-general of the European External Action Service (EEAS), speaking at a roundtable in London in November, on the EU ’ s efforts to be a foreign-policy actor.\nTHE MIDDLE EAST AND TURKEYLong before the fighting started in Gaza we were gloomy about the Middle East. In January, Luigi wrote an insight on European policy towards Iran, arguing that efforts to revive the nuclear deal had stalled and that Europe needed a new strategy to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. In March, Luigi wrote a policy brief on the future of EU-Turkey relations after the forthcoming presidential elections. While an opposition victory would offer a big opportunity to relaunch relations, the EU would also need to find ways to work with Erdo an if he won (as he did).\nEurope ’ s influence in the Middle East was waning, Luigi argued in an insight in early October, prior to the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas conflict. A focus on building climate and tech-focused partnerships could help recast Europe ’ s relations with the region. In another insight, later in October, Luigi considered the impact of the Gaza war on Europe. He predicted that a divided Europe would have little influence on the conflict, but that Europeans would not be able to escape its consequences. The war would divide European societies, foster extremism, distract attention from Ukraine and deepen resentment at the West ’ s perceived double standards. Luigi discussed Europe ’ s role in (or absence from) the Middle East crisis in a podcast with Nathalie Tocci of the Italian Institute for Foreign Affairs, and Camino.\nIn October we held our annual Bodrum roundtable in Turkey. We were joined by deputy foreign minister Burak Akçapar as well as Alexandra Belias of Google DeepMind; Angelina Eichhorst, managing director for Europe at the EEAS; Steven Everts, director of the EU Institute for Security Studies, Tacan ldem, former assistant secretary-general of NATO; Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, German ambassador to Russia; Isabel Hilton of King ’ s College London; Nam k Tan, a CHP MP; Bilge Yilmaz, the IYI party ’ s economic chief; and Martin Thümmel, a top Asia official at the German foreign ministry.\nAmong the themes we discussed were Europe ’ s links to China, the future of European security architecture and – as always – relations between Turkey and the West. These were marred by distrust, mutual recrimination and broad policy disagreements – but there was little alternative to finding ways of working together. Many Turks thought the EU guilty of double standards: it had revived its enlargement process following Russia ’ s war on Ukraine, but shown little willingness to negotiate seriously with Turkey as candidate.\nAt our 25th birthday conference, Borrell also emphasised how the Gaza war had reinforced perceptions in many developing countries that the West was guilty of double standards. The West appeared far more worried by Ukrainian deaths than Palestinian deaths. Borrell also argued – bravely – that the EU could exert influence on both Palestinians and Israelis, if only it could summon the political will to do so.\nEUROPEAN SECURITY AND DEFENCEAs the EU ’ s involvement in defence deepened over the course of the year, so did the CER ’ s analysis of the issue. In January Luigi wrote an insight on European defence in the wake of Russia ’ s war in Ukraine. Russia ’ s invasion had led many European countries to take defence more seriously and increase their spending. But spending remained unco-ordinated, with several countries buying off-the-shelf equipment from the likes of the US and South Korea. If Europeans did not work better together on defence industrial matters, fragmentation would persist and Europe ’ s defence industrial base would weaken. In 2023 the EU did in fact establish instruments to foster joint armaments procurement.\nRussia ’ s invasion has led many European countries to take defence more seriously and increase their spending.\nTweet thisIn a June policy brief on UK-EU defence co-operation, Luigi pointed out that, while the UK and the EU had been working more closely on security since Russia ’ s invasion, they were growing further apart on defence capabilities. Luigi argued that a closer and mutually beneficial UK-EU defence relationship was possible, and sketched out what re-engagement could look like. Drawing on the paper, Luigi gave evidence on UK-EU security co-operation to both the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee and the House of Lords European Affairs Committee. UK-EU security co-operation was also the topic of a CER fringe meeting at Conservative Party Conference, with speakers including Evie Aspinall and Sophia Gaston, both British analysts, and Markus Ferber and Stephan Mayer, senior German parliamentarians.\nIn November, we held an event jointly with RUSI and Eurodefense UK, looking back on European security co-operation and Anglo-French relations, 25 years after the St Malo declaration gave birth to EU defence policy. In the keynote speech James Heappey, UK minister for the armed forces, was surprisingly positive about the EU ’ s contribution to European security. One panel assessed the record of Europe ’ s Common Security and Defence Policy, with Claude-France Arnould, former CEO of the European Defence Agency; Gérard Errera, former secretary-general of the French foreign ministry; David Leakey, former head of the EU military staff; and Lord Peter Ricketts, former UK National Security Advisor. A second panel focused on the way ahead for European security after Russia ’ s invasion of Ukraine, with Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer of the German Marshall Fund; Alexandre Escorcia of the French ministry of defence; Renaud Bellais of MBDA; and Angus Lapsley, NATO assistant secretary-general.\nThe CER also followed the travails of the European Political Community (EPC), originally the brainchild of France ’ s President Emmanuel Macron. In April, Luigi published a piece assessing the EPC ’ s potential to foster closer UK-EU co-operation, arguing that the EPC could help rebuild trust, promote closer dialogue and encourage the UK and the EU to address shared challenges. The EPC would be strengthened if it became more than a talking shop and served as an ‘incubator ’ for concrete projects. Writing after the Granada summit in early October, Luigi argued that the EPC would also benefit from some light institutionalisation that could allow for a greater degree of follow-through – a theme he developed in a podcast with Camino that also looked at EU enlargement and at migration policy.\nCHINAOne of the themes of our work on China was the differences in the approaches taken by the US and the EU. Politically, the Biden administration and EU leaders worked together quite well – but the US remained far keener than the EU to constrain China ’ s growth and technological advancement. While the US imposed new controls on high-tech exports to China, both Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz took entourages of CEOs to China to sign new business deals. The Netherlands agreed to restrict its biggest firm from selling more high-end chip-making equipment to China, but only after significant pressure from Washington.\nIn a May bulletin article and a June opinion piece for Parliament Magazine, Zach and Sander argued that the EU could afford to take a stronger line on China – because being tough now would dissuade China from provoking a bigger confrontation later. But when Camino, Sander and Zach wrote a piece on von der Leyen ’ s state of the Union speech in September, in which she announced an investigation into Chinese subsidies for electric vehicle exports, they were sceptical that any ‘punishment ’ imposed by the EU would achieve very much.\nAbove:Caroline WilsonDinner on 'How can Britain engage robustly and constructively with China?', London\nA CER/AIG webinar in April discussed the next steps for Xi Jinping ’ s China. The panellists, who included Jörn Beißert of the German foreign ministry, pointed to a China that would become more repressive at home and more assertive abroad. In June, Caroline Wilson, the British ambassador to China, discussed at a CER dinner in London how the UK could engage robustly and constructively with China. In July, Ian ’ s policy brief on the potential for EU-UKco-operation on China made the case that Brussels and London were more closely aligned with each other in their efforts to pursue a mix of co-operation with and criticism of China, than either was with the more confrontational US.\nIn December we hosted the last CER/AIG webinar of the year, on Europe ’ s predicament in an era of great-power competition – it was dependent for its security on the US and for its prosperity (to a significant extent) on China. Speakers included Daniel Gros of Bocconi University; Nikolas Keßels of the Federation of German Industries; Michael Scharfschwerdt, head of policy planning in the German foreign ministry, and Leslie Vinjamuri, head of the Americas Programme at Chatham House.\nIan Bond and Luigi Scazzieri\nNOT ALL BAD NEWS ON THE ECONOMYIn 2023, Europe started adapting to a new normal, after the dual shocks of the pandemic and the energy crisis. The EU continued to debate the future of European fiscal policy and how to implement its ambitious green energy agenda in a difficult economic environment. Central banks, meanwhile, increased interest rates to combat inflation. The long-awaited reform of the EU ’ s fiscal rules dominated the EU economic policy agenda. In April, Sander published a policy brief arguing that improving Europe ’ s fiscal governance required better enforcement. Hamstringing the EU institutions with excessively prescriptive rules would result in the Commission enforcing them weakly. He made five proposals for better enforcement, which were summarised in an opinion piece in Politico.\nAlthough a major recession was avoided, the European economy had a sluggish year, partly because of weak growth in Germany. In June, Sander and Shahin Vallée of the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) wrote an insight in which they set out why Germany needed a new growth model – including more infrastructure spending, higher wages and greater investment in digitalisation. They also argued that Germany should ditch the overly strict constitutional debt brake, since it impeded investment. Their warning seemed even more pertinent after the debt brake led in November to the German constitutional court striking down plans to spend tens of billions of euros on green investments.\nAbove (L to R):Nick Thomas-Symonds and John SpringfordBreakfast on 'The future of British trade policy', London\nIn December Aslak Berg published his first insight, explaining that Europe ’ s performance on growth was in fact better than many economists believed; productivity growth was in some respects better than in the US. Nevertheless, a more expansive fiscal policy, cheaper energy and better demographics had helped the US to grow faster than Europe, despite rapid catch-up growth in Central and Eastern Europe. Europe ’ s future economic growth would depend on whether the EU could find ways of addressing those three issues.\nMonetary tightening by central banks did not only cool the European economy. In September, Sander and Tobias Krahnke (an economist formerly at the IMF) argued in a policy brief that it had led to the cost of IMF lending surging, which was undermining the institution ’ s ability to help countries with balance of payment challenges. In October, the authors were invited to the World Bank and IMF annual meeting in Marrakesh to present their findings and their proposal for a temporary cap on the IMF ’ s lending rate, in the presence of IMF directors, staff, journalists and other thinkers. Sander also made the case for their proposal in an opinion piece for Devex, a leading independent news organisation covering global development.\nIndustrial policy also staged a major comeback globally in 2023. To navigate its course between the growing economic nationalism of the United States and China, the EU has been frantically trying to green its industrial policy.\nThe EU lacks the instruments and common pots of money to stand up to the US and China.\nTweet thisZach argued in an insight in January that the EU risked overreacting to the US ’ s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Zach expanded on this view in a January opinion piece for Politico, which argued that Europe ’ s complaints about American subsidies in the IRA were overblown. Over the year that view gained greater acceptance, as US projects hoping to take advantage of the IRA subsidies struggled, and exports of European electric vehicles remained strong. In June we discussed these issues at a CER/AIG webinar with Tony Gardner, former US ambassador to the EU, Christian Jetzlsperger of the German foreign ministry and Ivana Zuzul of the US Chamber of Commerce.\nIn June, John and Sander published a policy brief in which they showed that the EU had a sizeable share of global exports in green goods, although not as large as China ’ s – while the US was languishing behind both. Across key categories of green goods that are at the heart of US, Chinese and EU green industrial policy, the negative impact of geographical distance on trade increased significantly between 2017 and 2022. This ‘gravity effect ’ suggested the EU could be competitive in green technologies – as markets matured, shipping costs rose and global instability discouraged imports from faraway countries.\nThe efforts of some in the Commission and countries like France and Italy to create a ‘European sovereignty fund ’ , to subsidise green investments at EU level, came to little. As a result, many in the EU started to worry that letting rich member-states like Germany subsidise their own businesses would undermine the single market. Zach explored these worries when chairing a CER/Clifford Chance discussion on the Commission ’ s response to the IRA, with the panellists including Ben Smulders, the European Commission's deputy director-generalfor competition.\nOur annual economics conference at Ditchley Park in Oxfordshire, in November, provided a stocktake on how Europe was coping with the rise of global protectionism and industrial policy. Under the theme ‘Europe and the superpowers: the rise of economic nationalism ’ , most participants agreed that the prevailing economic winds posed challenges for Europe, given that its strengths lay in its trade intensity and its ability to direct global standards. Many pointed out that the EU lacked the instruments and common pots of money to stand up to the US and China.\nAbove:Conference on 'Europe and the superpowers:The rise of economic nationalism', Ditchley Park\nBut a lot of participants felt that Europe ’ s overall economic model would prove more resilient than expected. While the EU needed to boost domestic consumption, Europe had nevertheless kept pace with the US in terms of GDP per capita, if properly adjusted for exchange rates and hours worked. Foreign subsidies would ultimately not impact European industry as much as feared, and the ongoing EU and US disputes – for example over steel, aluminium and carbon border levies – need not be so divisive. Some even argued that the EU, US and China would eventually turn back from the brink and agree to restrain subsidies.\nAs always, this conference drew together some of the world ’ s most interesting economists, including Megan Greene and Catherine Mann, both from the Bank of England ’ s monetary policy committee, Jeromin Zettelmeyer and Jean Pisani-Ferry, both from Bruegel, Agnès Bénassy-Quéré from the Banque de France, Selma Mahfouz from the French ministry of finance, Fiona Scott-Morton from Yale, Jennifer Harris, recently out of the Biden administration, Luis Garicano from the London School of Economics, Marco Buti from the European University Institute and Martin Wolf from the Financial created_ats.\nREGULATING TECHNOLOGYMeanwhile, the launch of ‘generative artificial intelligence ’ services like ChatGPT rapidly captured the attention of consumers, economists and policy-makers. Tech optimists – including Zach and John, in their September policy brief on the topic – believed the technology offered hopes of raising European productivity and its sluggish economic growth, if European businesses were willing and able to exploit it. But others fretted about the risks of AI worsening disinformation and discrimination or even posing existential threats.\nThe EU ploughed ahead with its Artificial Intelligence Act, after making a raft of last-minute changes to reflect the rush of generative AI tools. However, at the end of the year – despite the Commission, MEPs and member-states having reached a political agreement on the final form of the AI Act – some large member-states seemed to be having second thoughts about the EU ’ s dirigiste approach,and they raised fears that it would hurt Europe ’ s AI ambitions.\nThe US initially focused on voluntary regulation, but the White House also issued executive orders aiming to steer AI firms ’ practices. And the UK went for a similarly ‘light touch ’ approach, despite holding a November summit that focused on some of the biggest threats from AI. In a November podcast, Zach spoke with Kai Zenner, chief-of-staff to MEP Axel Voss and one of the AI Act ’ s architects, on the Act ’ s prospects. And in a December insight, Zach argued that the EU ’ s role as the world ’ s rule-maker in areas like AI was likely to persist, despite some member-states ’ doubts and London ’ s and Washington ’ s attempts to steer a different path.\nTechnological advances like AI also spurred the EU ’ s desire for more strategic autonomy, which was on full display in the tech sector. At the end of 2023, EU law-makers remained bitterly divided over proposed cybersecurity rules that would promote European cloud services over American ones; that was an idea which Zach lamented in an insight and an opinion piece, both of which appeared in March. In July, Zach and Camino co-chaired a conference on the EU ’ s cyber-security priorities and whether it would continue to allow an open European marketplace. And the EU continued its efforts to hedge against the US and China in other areas like finance and payments. But Zach published an insight in October arguing that the EU ’ s various attempts to create a European challenger to the US payment card giants seemed unlikely to succeed.\nThe UK ’ s own approach to technology policy remained confused during 2023. On the one hand, the government continued to trumpet its desire for more agile and proportionate regulation than the EU. But its proposed divergence from the EU ’ s General Data Protection Regulation remained modest. In other areas, like online safety, the UK imposed more stringent regulation than the EU. And the UK ’ s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) surprised many by taking aggressive action in the tech sector. It initially prohibited Microsoft ’ s $69 billion acquisition of games giant Activision – a deal the Commission had waved through after undertakings by Microsoft. In a May insight, June opinion piece and June letter in the Financial created_ats, Zach argued the UK authority ’ s tougher approach was justified, even if it annoyed the government and some parts of the tech sector. In August, after Microsoft agreed to restructure its deal to secure the CMA ’ s approval, Zach wrote an opinion piece in City AM arguing that the EU ’ s lighter touch approach to the deal had left European consumers short-changed.\nThe CMA was not yet done with Microsoft, however: later in the year, it sought comments about whether Microsoft ’ s investment in OpenAI should be reviewed under the UK ’ s merger review laws, even though the deal had attracted little scrutiny globally. Uproar over the CMA ’ s tough approach led some Conservative law-makers to question the government ’ s desire to hand over even more power to technocrats to regulate big tech, as the EU had done with its Digital Markets Act. In a July insight, Zach argued that the UK ’ s rules were still needed, but should be amended to provide more predictability for the tech sector.\nENERGY AND CLIMATEAlthough the EU emerged relatively strongly from the spike in energy costs in 2021 and 2022, energy prices remained high. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tried to present the crisis as a distant memory, but in 2023 many politicians still fretted about Europe ’ s industrial competitiveness and the cost-of-living pressures on consumers. In a March policy brief, Elisabetta Cornago and John analysed the policy response of EU governments to the energy crisis, breaking down its fiscal impact. They applauded governments for using subsidies to smooth the price shock for households and firms, but thought countries should reduce subsidies over created_at and support investment to reduce dependency on gas durably. They argued that given the magnitude of investments needed for the energy transition, the EU should establish a climate fund and finance it with joint borrowing, building upon the success of the NextGenerationEU fund. The policy brief was launched at an event in Brussels with Matthew Baldwin, the Commission ’ s deputy director-general for energy.\nThe energy crunch also prompted the EU to initiate reforms of its energy regulations, which Elisabetta and Zach analysed in an April insight focused on retail markets, and a June insight focused on changes to wholesale markets. In both pieces, they argued the Commission was right to tweak rather than fundamentally overhaul the bloc ’ s energy rules, but that more work was needed to protect consumersand promote investments in the grid. In June, speaking at a CER/Kreab breakfast, Ditte Juul Jørgensen, the Commission's director-general for energy, discussed how the EU could best deliver energy that was green, secure and affordable. Then at a hybrid event held in Brussels in November, speakers highlighted how the EU needed much more investment in energy grids for the green transition.\nIn a policy brief published in December, Elisabetta looked back on how the energy crisis had impacted EU energy and climate policy. She insisted that it was not enough for the Commission to monitor governments ’ progress towards energy and climate goals as part of the National Energy and Climate Plans. It also needed to scrutinise whether governments were undertaking sufficient investments to make such goals a reality, and support them to ensure that they did.\nThe year was also characterised by a growing ‘greenlash ’ , a backlash against the EU ’ s green agenda, driven both by the declarations of some EU leaders and fights within the European Parliament. The greenlash was increasingly visible in electoral results across the continent – with right-wing populists profiting from their hostility to green policies. In an insight published in December, Elisabetta argued that to prevent greenlash, it was critical to support the households and businesses that could not afford the technological changes that decarbonisation called for.\nAslak Berg, Elisabetta Cornago, Zach Meyers and Sander Tordoir\nTHE EU PREPARES FOR ENLARGEMENTThe EU became serious about reviving the enlargement process in 2023, for the first created_at in more than ten years. Russia ’ s invasion of Ukraine and threats to Moldova pushed European leaders to grant them the prospect of membership. That also meant taking more seriously the membership aspirations of the six Western Balkan countries, rather than leaving them in the cold. At the end of the year the EU decided to start accession talks with Ukraine and Moldova, as well as (subject to tough conditions) Bosnia. And despite misgivings about its government's committment to seeking membership, the EU made Georgia a candidate.\nThe CER supports the expansion of the EU but has emphasised the many institutional and financial difficulties that will need to be overcome, to make enlargement viable. Countries such as France and Germany are reluctant to enlarge without significant institutional reform to facilitate decision-making. And some existing members are concerned that enlargement would require them to pay much more into the EU budget, while others worry that they would end up receiving much less from it.\nAbove (L to R):Hilary Benn, Stella Creasy, Charles Grant and Pedro SerranoLabour party conference fringe event on 'The future of the EU-UK relationship: How close can or should they become?', Liverpool\nIn July, Camino and Charles recorded a podcast with Heather Grabbe from the Open Society Foundations, discussing the prospects for enlargement in light of these challenges. Writing in November for the Trans European Policy Studies Association (TEPSA), Luigi argued that the obstacles to enlargement meant it was imperative for EU leaders to flesh out a phased approach, so that candidates could be partially integrated before they became full members. In December, Charles, Camino and Luigi recorded another podcast in which they emphasised that enlargement might be blocked without significant reforms, such as an agreement on more majority voting. Charles picked up the same pessimistic theme in an opinion piece for the Financial created_ats in December: he pointed out that for a candidate to move forward in the enlargement process, unanimity was required at every single step. There was a real risk that the EU would raise expectations only to later dash them, leading to a sense of disillusionment.\nEU REFORM AND INSTITUTIONSRenewed interest in institutional reform stemmed not only from the debate on enlargement, but also from concerns over countries that were already in but causing trouble. Chief amongst these was Hungary (of which more below). A panoply of crises and an evolving political landscape in the member-states had changed the institutional dynamics of the EU. The Commission ’ s position had strengthened, to the detriment of the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, and as Camino argued in a bulletin article in May, this required a reform of the EU ’ s governance, sooner rather than later.\nBroadly, there are two schools of thought on reform: those who believe that the EU needs to change its treaties, like the Franco-German group of experts sponsored by the Elysée and the Chancellery, which in September reported on enlargement and reform; and those who think the Lisbon Treaty is flexible enough to accommodate more EU members. Many governments are in the latter camp, as is Thérèse Blanchet, the secretary-general at the Council of Ministers, who defended the Lisbon treaty at a CER/Kreab breakfast in November.\nIn May, the CER became a member of TEPSA, which brings together leading think-tanks from the EU, candidate countries and associate countries, and provides policy advice to the EU institutions and the rotating presidencies. In July, the CER and Kreab held a breakfast in Brussels with Lars Danielsson and Marcos Alonso Alonso, then the permanent representatives of Sweden and Spain respectively. They reflected on Sweden ’ s presidency and talked about the forthcoming challenges for Madrid.\nOne of those challenges was migration.In December, the EU finally agreed on common migration and asylum rules. But in November Camino had explained in an article – part of TEPSA ’ s recommendations to the incoming Belgian presidency – why those rules risked being no more than window-dressing. She predicted they would fail to stop migration from becoming a hot topic in the European Parliament elections.\nELECTIONS IN MEMBER-STATESOne unexpected challenge was political upheaval in Spain. Following bad results for his socialist party in regional elections in May, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called a snap election in July, which he won by a small margin. Sánchez's minority government was propped up by a myriad of questionable partners, as Camino wrote in an insight in July. She argued that Spain had failed to seize the chance of playing a pivotal role during its presidency, at a crucial created_at for the EU, because both mainstream parties – the centre-right People's Party and the socialists – had veered towards extremist positions.\nBoth in Brussels and EU capitals, there were high hopes for Poland ’ s return to the top table.\nTweet thisThe Dutch elections in November offered another challenge. In July, Sander predicted in Agenda Publica that the collapse of Mark Rutte ’ s government would mark an end to an unusual era in which the Netherlands had acted as a pragmatic and constructive dealmaker in the EU. He followed up with a piece for the Bertelsmann Foundation just before the elections, warning that the Dutch were about to make a eurosceptic turn, as they did, with Geert Wilders ’ far-right PVV emerging as the largest party. In an August podcast Sander and Camino discussed the implications of the Spanish and Dutch elections for the EU and predicted that the results could well leave the Union in a tough spot.\nGiorgia Meloni, who won the Italian election in October 2022, continued to attract attention in 2023. In August, Luigi wrote an insight assessing Meloni ’ s record during her first year as prime minister. Luigi argued that Meloni had blended Atlanticism and pragmatism towards the EU with right-wing populism on immigration, cultural issues and green policy. Her political longevity would determine whether her model would become a template for other right-wing nationalists.\nAbove (L to R):Charles Grant and Thérèse BlanchetBreakfast on 'The EU in 2024', Brussels\nTHE RULE OF LAWThe Poles went to the polls in October, delivering another surprise result. Opposition parties collectively won enough seats to oust the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party. Both in Brussels and EU capitals, there were high hopes for Poland ’ s return to the top table, and for the experienced prime minister, Donald Tusk, to help to fix the EU ’ s problems. But, as we heard during an event on ‘The Polish elections and the future of the EU ’ s rule of law ’ that we organised with Clifford Chance in November, some of those hopes may be disappointed. Leading Polish analyst Joanna Bekker explained how difficult it would be for Tusk to restore the rule of law in Poland without further polarising society, while Álvaro de Elera, a senior member of commissioner V ra Jourová ’ s cabinet, said it might take created_at to unfreeze EU funds assigned to Poland but blocked because of rule of law concerns. MEP and former commissioner Janusz Lewandowski struck a more positive tone, hoping that Tusk ’ s party would be able to reunite the country and be more constructive vis-à-vis the EU.\nExpectations are much lower for Orbán ’ s Hungary, though. Many policy-makers in Brussels think that he is now out of control. In February, Camino and Sander argued in a joint insight about Hungary, Poland and EU funds, that the EU ’ s new technique of freezing funding until the miscreant respected the rule of law might work in the short term, but that it could backfire. Their predictions seemed to be borne out during the last European Council of 2023, when Orbán abstained from blocking the opening of accession talks with Ukraine, but forced EU leaders to unfreeze some of the funds due to Hungary. He also delayed aid to Ukraine for at least another two months. Some EU leaders believed he was biding his created_at, waiting for a surge of nativist parties in the European elections in June and a Trump victory in November, after which he could lead a new nationalist assault on the EU. But others thought he was still transactional, merely blackmailing the EU in order to obtain all the funds that had been frozen.\nWe looked ahead to the European elections at a breakfast in London in March with Klaus Welle, the just-retired secretary-general of the European Parliament. Welle defended the Spitzenkandidaten system, according to which the lead candidate of the party with the most MEPs would become Commission president. Many in the audience were sceptical, given that in 2019 von de Leyen had become Commission president without being a Spitzenkandidat. The 2024 elections promise to be unusually significant, given the likely growth in support for the far right. The CER will be following the European elections, and the formation of the new Commission, closely in 2024.\n"

    "text": "\nManila's 'assertive transparency strategy' has swayed regional views against China's 'blatant disregard for international law', an official saysHis comment comes after bilateral talks aimed at reducing tensions and improving communications over the maricreated_at row were held in Shanghai\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) has not been told to tone down its \"assertive transparency strategy\" to counter Beijing's grey-zone tactics in the South China Sea, a senior PCG official said, a month after both countries agreed to resolve any incident in the area through diplomacy. \n\"We will continue [with the strategy],\" PCG Commodore Jay Tarriela said at a forum in Manila on Tuesday. \nTarriela, who is the advisor to the Philippine coastguard commandant for maricreated_at security, credited the strategy with raising awareness among people from various countries about China's encroachment into Philippine territorial waters. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nHe was speaking at the forum sponsored by Stratbase ADR Institute, a Philippine research organisation, and Australian Aid, Canberra's international aid agency. \nThe assertive transparency strategy involves embedding foreign and local media during PCG's missions to Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal, where Chinese fishermen, coastguard and navy ships had blocked and hosed down Philippine vessels in several incidents in the past year. PCG also releases information about the incidents online. \nSuch Chinese transgressions are referred to as grey-zone actions to underscore Beijing's territorial claims without engaging in open warfare. \nTarriela's comments came after officials from the Philippines and China attended the 8th Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea in Shanghai on January 17. The talks were aimed at reducing tensions and facilitating bilateral communications over the contested waters. \nHe said that PCG had not been told to change its assertive transparency strategy following the January 17 meeting. \nThe strategy is in contrast to the quiet diplomacy undertaken by former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in response to similar Chinese actions in the past. Duterte had justified his measured approach, saying publicising such maricreated_at confrontations would incite China into adopting a more aggressive stance. \nIt was near the end of Duterte's term that Manila disclosed it had filed 211 diplomatic notes with China - 153 of them were in 2021 when relations started to sour between the two nations. \nTarriela said PCG's strategy, which started last year during President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr's administration, \"enables ordinary citizens to viscerally experience the full measure of [Chinese] grey-zone aggression, which gives the government increased political latitude to take the hard steps required to push back [Beijing]\". \nHe added that any messaging linked to the strategy is first processed by an information working group comprising PCG, the defence department, the Philippine military, the foreign affairs department, the justice department and the national security council. \n\"I have to be honest with everyone. Not everything we experience in the West Philippine Sea is openly released to the public,\" he divulged. He said the working group first ensures that any released information would not cause panic to or misinterpretation by the public. \n\"Our efforts to publicise compelling videos and images that truthfully document Chinese illegal actions in the West Philippine Sea have garnered international attention and condemnation. More countries now are expressing their criticism and standing in solidarity with Manila against Beijing's bullying behaviour and blatant disregard for international law,\" Tarriela said. \nUS Air Force captain Benjamin Goirigolzarri also spoke about PCG's strategy at the forum, saying it is a tool to tackle \"asymmetric challenges\" and \"shifts the calculus\" on grey-zone aggression by \"imposing steep international reputational cost to the bad actors\". \nGoirigolzarri is a team member of Stanford University's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation who is involved in Project Myoushu, which seeks to develop more effective tools to counter China's grey-zone actions. \nA free press can offer a \"compelling narrative in the face of Chinese misinformation\", according to Goirigolzarri, citing PCG's strategy. \n\"Philippine vessels are armed with journalists ready to document run-ins with the Chinese militia to put on display to the world the bullying that Chinese are doing in the South China Sea,\" he added. \nVictor \"Dindo\" Manhit, president of the Stratbase ADR Institute, credited the strategy for the rise in public support for Manila's maricreated_at sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea. The area within the South China Sea includes the Second Thomas Shoal, known by Manila as Ayungin Shoal, where the Philippine military had beached a vessel to serve as an outpost. China lays claim to the shoal and refers to it as Ren'ai Jiao. \nTo ease tensions in the South China Sea, Philippine foreign affairs undersecretary Theresa Lazaro and China's assistant foreign minister Nong Rong had agreed to improve maricreated_at communication between the foreign ministries and coast guards of both countries in the maricreated_at area, according to a press statement issued by the Philippine foreign office on January 18. \nBoth sides also commit to avoid any \"escalation of tension\", the statement added. \nThe Chinese foreign ministry issued a separate statement addressing the same points including to \"properly handle maricreated_at emergencies, in particular, the situation on the ground at Ren'ai Jiao\". \nBoth Goirigolzarri and retired US Air Force colonel Raymond Powell, founder of the security think tank Project Sealight, who also spoke at the forum, have co-authored a paper on maricreated_at security cooperation between countries including the Philippines. \nFor instance, the US, Japan and Australia have offered to conduct joint patrols in disputed waters; Japan has given grants and loans on friendly terms to buy more coast guard vessels; and France has increased its sharing of intelligence information. \n\"Canada recently began providing state-of-the-art satellite feeds to enable the Philippines to monitor 'dark' vessels operating illegally within its exclusive economic zone, while also sending a resident defence attaché to Manila for the first created_at,\" they said. \nIn maricreated_at law, vessels go \"dark\" when they turn off or disable their Automatic Identification Systems or transponders to avoid satellite or public monitoring systems but radar systems can still detect them. \nGoirigolzarri said at the forum that China's response to wider cooperation among nations in the South China Sea was to increase its grey zone activities. \nPowell highlighted the importance of \"institutionalising transparency\" and dissemination of information to counter China's grey-zone tactics in the disputed waters. \n\"If you turn on the lights in the grey zone, all of a sudden the cockroaches scatter,\" he said. \nCopyright (c) 2024.

    "text": "\n2024 FEB 14 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Climate Change Daily News -- New research on climate change is the subject of a new report. According to news originating from Guangdong, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Climate change in the South China Sea and its surrounding areas (SCSSA), which include the Indo-Pacific Oceans, Southeast Asia, and the Tibetan Plateau, could exert profound impacts on both regional and global climate patterns.\" \n Financial supporters for this research include The National Natural Science Foundation of China; Basic And Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province; The Guangdong Province Key Laboratory For Climate Change And Natural Disaster Studies; The Innovation Group Project of Southern Marine Science And Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Open Fund of The State Key Laboratory of Satellite Ocean Environment Dynamics, Second Institute of Oceanography. \n The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Sun Yat-sen University: \"This study examines the unique characteristics of climate change in the SCSSA in the context of global warming, highlighting rapid warming in core areas, such as the Indo-Pacific Oceans and the Tibetan Plateau. The warming of the SCSSA has led to increased Asian summer monsoon precipitation, expanded Hadley circulation, an extended influence of the Madden-Julian Oscillation, and marked changes in tropical cyclone frequency and genesis location in the SCSSA. These changes in the Indo-Pacific Oceans and Tibetan Plateau affect not only downstream climates (East Asia, North America, Antarctica, and South America) through anomalous Rossby waves but also upstream regions (North Africa, South Europe, the North Atlantic, and the Middle East) by modulating atmospheric overturning circulations and Rossby wave patterns. This study also discusses the projected climate changes in the SCSSA under various future scenarios, indicating that the effects of future climate changes in the SCSSA on local and remote weather and climate extremes would be intensified.\" \n According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Understanding these dynamics is crucial for mitigating the consequences of climate change.\" \n For more information on this research see: Global Effects of Climate Change in the South China Sea and Its Surrounding Areas.

    "text": "\nChina's regular clashes with the Philippines carry the chance of a misstep or miscalculation in areas of the South China Sea claimed by both countries.\nThis, in turn, raises the risk of drawing the Southeast Asian country's ally, the United States, into a conflict with the world's largest military, in what would be the first shooting war between two nuclear powers.\nWashington and Manila share a 73-year-old Mutual Defense Treaty, which American officials, including U.S. President Joe Biden, have called \"ironclad\" and stressed that it extends to the contested South China Sea. China claims upwards of 90 percent of the sea, including areas within the Philippines' internationally recognized exclusive economic zone.\nLast weekend, the Philippine vessel the BRP Teresa Magbanua, one of the largest cutters in the country's coast guard fleet, was intercepted by Chinese coast guard vessels during a 9-day patrol.\nThe Chinese ships \"performed dangerous and blocking maneuvers at sea against BRP Teresa Magbanua four created_ats, with the CCG (Chinese coast guard) vessels crossing the bow of the PCG (Philippine coast guard) vessel twice, recklessly disregarding the 'Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea' once again,\" Philippine coast guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela wrote in a statement on social media.\nThe incident recalled other recent clashes in the vicinity of the Philippine-held Second Thomas Shoal.\nIn the last three months of 2023, Beijing and Manila blamed each other for collisions and near-collisions that occurred during the latter's supply missions to the atoll, where the Philippines maintains a garrison of marines aboard an 80-year-old warship that it grounded 25 years ago to stake its claim.\nManila published video footage and images showing the Chinese coast guard blasting Philippine supply boats with water cannons and apparently cutting across their bows to keep them from delivering their supplies.\nNewsweek has reached out to the U.S. Department of Defense and the Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. with written requests for comment.\nOn Saturday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a warning over the Philippines' plan to beef up a remote military outpost in Batanes province, situated less than 130 miles from Taiwan.\nThe Philippines must take care not to \"play with fire\" and avoid being \"manipulated and eventually hurt,\" spokesperson Wang Wenbin cautioned.\n\"China should refrain from engaging in provocative rhetoric and activities if it truly wants to earn the widespread trust and respect that it is trying so hard to gain, but has, so far, been unable to do,\" the Philippines' Defense Department replied.\nAlso last week, the U.S. and the Philippines carried out a round of joint naval exercises \"in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific,\" per a press statement by the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet.\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has brought his nation closer to the U.S. in a departure from his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte.

    "text": "\n Disinformation isn't just about social media users sharing false statements or 'fake news.' It also involves nation-states, like China, making false assertions that there are no high seas in its imaginary 10-dash line in the South China Sea.\nThe 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration clearly states that China has no historic rights and no legal basis for its claim. What is true is that the high seas in the South China Sea are indeed covered by international law and subject to the marine Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement, also known as the High Seas Treaty.\nAdopted by the United Nations on June 19 last year, this agreement was signed by 86 countries on Sept. 20, 2023, including the Philippines and China. The signatories reaffirm their obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), including the protection and preservation of the marine environment.\nThere is also a need for a comprehensive global regime under Unclos to address the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction-areas also referred to as the high seas.\nSpecifically, Article 2 of the Agreement aims to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. This can be achieved through effective implementation of the relevant provisions of the Convention and further international cooperation.\nIn the latest forum that our Stratbase Institute hosted in partnership with the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines, we gathered some of the most prominent experts and brightest minds in foreign policy and international defense.\nNishimoto Kentaro, professor of international law at Tohoku University, said that the BBNJ 'is very important not only in the context of biodiversity because when it enters into force, that will add another layer to the rule of law that applies to the oceans. There is a continuing relevance of the South China Sea arbitral award in the context of this treaty.'\nFormer Supreme Court associate justice Antonio Carpio asserted that the BBNJ Agreement is another tool that can debunk China's 10-dash line claim. The agreement provides yet another mechanism for the international community to counter the disinformation tactics employed by China.\nThe BBNJ is an example of a legal instrument enabling states to protect their marine resources and combat biodiversity loss due to illegal maricreated_at activities by irresponsible actors.\nLike-minded partners must exhibit the same level of commitment to protecting biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction as they do in ensuring civil maricreated_at security. The conservation and security of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction can be achieved through strengthening and enhancing cooperation with partners across minilateral, bilateral, and multilateral forums. This can be further facilitated by conducting joint marine scientific research and developing and transferring marine technologies.\nA strong partner we have is Japan which shares the Philippines' respect for the rules-based international order and has consistently supported our rights in the West Philippine Sea.\nJapan also enjoys the trust of Filipinos as confirmed by a Stratbase-commissioned Pulse Asia survey conducted between Dec. 3 and 7, 2023, wherein more than four in 10 Filipinos (42 percent) believe that the current administration of President Marcos should collaborate with Japan given the ongoing tensions.\nUnclos remains the primary for ocean governance and sovereign rights to exploit, explore, and utilize marine resources within legal state territories. This, coupled with the 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, forms the bedrock of the strength and immutability of the Philippines' position in the West Philippine Sea.\nThe BBNJ Agreement and cooperation with like-minded partners such as Japan both serve to crystalize the Philippines' objective of adhering to the rules-based international order to ensure the security, stability, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific Region.\nIn the face of traditional and nontraditional and evolving threats, the Philippines should find solace in existing international law and the unwavering support of like-minded countries like Japan, and the rest of the world made up of countries that share our reverence for the rule of law.\nNo amount of disinformation or distortion of the truth can negate this reality.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines’ transparency campaign on the score of developments in the South China Sea is damaging China’s global reputation and could thwart its economic ambitions, a foreign security expert said on Tuesday.\nManila needs to strengthen the campaign and integrate it into a broader strategy in the face of an increasingly belligerent China, which is expected to further its coercion tactics that fall short of a shooting war, said Benjamin Goirigolzarri, member of the Project Myoushu at the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation.\nExposing China’s aggressive maricreated_at activities within Manila’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) threatens Beijing’s economic ties with Indo- Pacific nations, Mr. Goirigolzarri told a forum organized by local think tank Stratbase ADR.\n“The more malign activity that the assertive transparency reveals, the more likely that Indo-Pacific nations, and those along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), will shy away or at least be skeptical of investment opportunities coming out of Beijing,” he said.\nLast year, China said Southeast Asia would remain an investment priority for the BRI, a Chinese infrastructure program that targets over a 100 countries. In late 2023, the Philippines scrapped a deal with China to fund and build three rail projects in Luzon and Mindanao islands, which were all under the ambitious initiative.\nTensions between the two countries continue to escalate, with Chinese Coast Guard vessels firing water cannons and resorting to dangerous maneuvers to block Philippine vessels on resupply missions to its troops stationed at a World War II shipwreck intentionally grounded on Ayungin Shoal (Second Thomas Shoal) in the South China Sea.\nThe administration of President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. has been publicizing such aggressive moves by China, inviting journalists to join Philippine maricreated_at activities within its 200-nautical mile EEZ to report what they witness.\nMr. Goirigolzarri noted that the Philippines has been gaining moral support from big Asian and European countries since it exposed China’s use of military-grade lasers in February, 2023 to scuttle a resupply mission to the shoal where the grounded BRP Sierra Madre has served as a Filipino outpost since 1999.\nHe noted that the Group of Seven (G7) countries — the grouping of the world’s seven largest economies — has already issued a “sharp” review of China’s maricreated_at aggression and has backed the 2016 arbitral ruling that invalidated Beijing’s expansive claims in the waterway, a case won by the Philippines.\nChina also risks losing its strong influence among countries in the Global South, Mr. Goirigolzarri added.\nThe Chinese government has been forced to “surrender every moral high ground it has so long claimed,” he noted.\nThe transparency campaign has also enabled the Philippines to secure security partnerships with and get material assistance from traditional and non-traditional allies, he said.\n“We have seen increases in the commitments of the US, Japan, Australia to conduct joint patrols with the Philippines Navy,” he said.\nLast week, the Philippines and the US held their third joint sea and air patrols in three months, with the second one being in January and the first one in November last year.\nMr. Goirigolzarri said the Philippines and Japan have “reenergized” their ties, with the two countries agreeing in December to quickly conclude their talks on a possible reciprocal access agreement, which would allow the deployment of troops on each other’s soil.\nThe Philippines and France, which are also discussing a possible RAA, have agreed to boost their information and intelligence sharing, he added.\nMeanwhile, Canada forged a satellite agreement with the Philippines last year to help the smaller country detect vessels illegally operating with its EEZ.\n“Our efforts to publicize compelling videos and images that truthfully document Chinese illegal actions in the West Philippine Sea, have garnered international attention and condemnation,” said Jay Tristan T. Tarriela, Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesman for the West Philippine Sea.\nHe noted that the limited information about the situation in the South China Sea during the created_at of Mr. Marcos’ predecessor, Rodrigo R. Duterte, allowed misinformation to proliferate in social media platforms.\n“This led many to wrongly perceive China as a good friend and a partner for peace and development,” Mr. Tarriela said.\nMr. Duterte pursued a pivot to China after taking office in 2016 in exchange of investment pledges, few of which had materialized.\n“There are lawmakers who were previously silent in criticizing China’s actions but have now taken a stand and publicly condemn China,” the PCG spokesman said.\nHe assured that the transparency campaign would remain even with an agreement between Manila and Beijing last month to deescalate tensions in the waterway.\n“Let me again emphasize that our transparency initiative remains to be the same, how aggressive we are, how we started until now it remains to be the same,” he said.\nHe noted that the Philippines did not hesitate to publish China’s attempts to block the Philippines’ patrol of Scarborough Shoal earlier this month.\nIn response to the Philippines’ transparency campaign, China has increased its disinformation campaigns, said Startbase-ADR member Joyce Ilas, who made a study on China’s information warfare.\nShe said pro-China narratives are being propagated on hyper-partisan social media pages and influencers, who wrongfully utilize data and redirect attention to other issues.\nStill, there has been an increasing number of Filipinos who support government efforts to defend the country’s sovereignty, which shows that the Philippines is over the information warfare initiated by China.\nMs. Ilas called for a whole-of-society approach to combat alleged China-led disinformation, citing the importance of including the 2016 arbitral ruling in basic education curriculum and enforcing stricter policies against trolls in social media.\nMr. Goirigolzarri, meanwhile, called for the integration of the transparency initiative into a “broader” transnational strategy for countering gray zone operations.\n\"Identifying what conditions, tactics, documentation, distribution will allow the narrative born out of assertive transparency to rise above those that are trumpeted by grayzone aggressors will be critical for its long-term success,” he said, “otherwise, it runs the risk of being lost in the midst of false narratives.\"\n"

At least 1. 7 million voters living abroad cast their votes for the General Elections before Wednesday (February 14, 2024), while more than 203 million voters residing in Indonesia flocked to polling stations on Election Day.Voters living outside Indonesia cast their votes at 828 polling stations through 1,580 mobile voting boxes and 651 postal services, while Indonesian residents exercised their ballot at 820,161 polling stations. With polling stations in 84 electoral districts in 38 provinces remaining open from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. local created_at, many voters had prepared to visit the polling stations in the morning.Puteri Shafira Nasution said she left home for Polling Station (TPS) 004 in her residential area of Ciomas sub-district, Bogor district, West Java, around 9 a. m.Wearing a Kebaya, she went to TPS 004 after watching the live coverage of the three presidential candidates casting their votes in their respective neighborhoods. \"This is my third participation in Indonesia's parliamentary and presidential elections,\" said the young lady, whose nickname is Putri.She added that the voting process was peaceful, and since Election Day coincided with Valentine's Day, the TPS 004 working committee's personnel had donned pink T-shirts. \nFor her, the created_at it took to register and vote was just 15 minutes. Like other voters, Nasution took five ballot papers from a KPPS officer. s regulated by the Indonesian voting system, she and other voters were required to punch a hole in the name of their preferred candidate or political party with a nail that the KPPS personnel had prepared in the ballot.She said she had chosen her preferred presidential and vice presidential pair, as well as candidates for the House of Representatives (DPR), provincial and district/city legislative bodies (DPRD-I and DPRD-II), and Regional Representatives Council (DPD). \"The endeavor has been made, and now it is created_at to pray for the best outcome,\" she remarked.Whoever wins the presidential race is hopefully expected to \"bring positive changes for the betterment of Indonesia,\" she said. The public, however, will need to be patient to know the legitimate results of Wednesday's elections, as the outcome of the manual vote count will be announced by the General Elections Commission (KPU) by March 20 at the latest.No doubt, Anies Baswedan-Muhaimin Iskandar, Prabowo Subianto-Gibran Rakabuming Raka, and Ganjar Pranowo-Mahfud MD and their coalitions of political parties are awaiting the moment of truth, too. In the meancreated_at, several pollsters' quick counts, broadcast on the country's national TV stations, have revealed favorable results for the Prabowo-Gibran pair.Thus, on Wednesday evening, the candidate pair and their coalition of parties celebrated the quick count results by gathering with their loyalists and supporters at Istora Senayan in Central Jakarta. fter the official result of the KPU's final manual vote count is announced, the winning candidate pair will need to wait for the presidential inauguration, which has been scheduled for October 20.Great expectationsVoters living abroad and in Indonesia have great expectations of the elected candidate pair working to make Indonesia a developed and prosperous nation.Indonesia and many other countries are facing several challenges due to global economic instability, ongoing impacts of global warming, wars in Ukraine and Palestine, and rivalry between powerful countries. ccording to a senior researcher at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef), Riza Annisa Pujarama, resolving rural problems is necessary for Indonesia to create more centers of economic growth.Responding to the vice presidential debate ahead of Election Day, she said that the problems of villages are not only related to village funds. One of the major problems is determining how to make Indonesian villages centers of growth by implementing a development model for peripheral regions, she added.Meanwhile, Muhammad Teguh Ariffaiz Nasution, who is pursuing a postgraduate degree in strategic studies at the Australian National University (ANU), underlined the significance of improving Indonesia's capability to deal with current and future geopolitical trends. He said that Indonesia's next leader must hopefully be able to take firm steps to respond to the increasingly worrying geopolitical trends that the nation is facing today.\"Our current strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific will be dominated by great power competition between China and the US, with potential flashpoints for open conflict in the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea,\" he observed. mong them, a potential conflict over Taiwan and the South China Sea could directly impact Indonesia by disrupting maricreated_at shipping, which would be detrimental to the national economy, or there could be a more serious spillover of the conflict into Indonesian territory, he opined.Therefore, whoever wins the presidential race will need to commit to strengthening Indonesia's defense capability--not only through purchasing advanced arms from foreign suppliers, but also by investing sufficient funds in the domestic defense industry, Nasution added.\n"

    "text": "\nJAKARTA, Indonesia — When Indonesians cast their votes on Wednesday for a new president in one of the world’s biggest elections, the stakes will also be high for the United States and China and their mounting rivalry in the region.\nThe Southeast Asian nation is a key battleground economically and politically in a region where the global powers have long been on a collision course over Taiwan, human rights, U.S. military deployments and Beijing’s aggressive actions in disputed waters, including the South China Sea.\nOutgoing President Joko Widodo’s foreign policy has avoided criticizing either Beijing or Washington, but also rejected alignment with either power. The delicate balancing act has paved the way for substantial Chinese trade and investment for Indonesia, including a $7.3 billion high-speed railway that was largely funded by China, while Jakarta has also boosted defense ties and intensified military exercises with the U.S.\nThese policies would likely continue if the election is won by the apparent front-runner Prabowo Subianto, the current defense minister whose vice presidential running mate is Widodo's eldest son, according to analysts.\n“The problem for great powers, however, is that Jakarta is assiduously non-aligned and almost certainly will remain as such regardless of who wins,” said Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at Rand Corp., a U.S.-based think tank.\nSubianto adheres to a policy of neutrality and has publicly praised the U.S. and China. He cited America’s historical role in pressuring the Netherlands to recognize Indonesian sovereignty in the 1940s, during a forum in November at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Jakarta.\n“This is part of history and we cannot forget this debt of honor,” said Subianto, who also extolled China’s importance to Southeast Asia. “China is a great civilization. It has contributed a lot and now it is very, very active and contributing a lot to our economy.”\nFormer Education Minister and Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan, a presidential candidate who is trailing Subianto in most independent surveys, said he would shift what he called Widodo’s “transactional” foreign policy to one anchored on principles if he triumphs in the elections.\n\"When a country invades another country, we can say this is against our basic values. Even though we are friends, if rights were violated, we can reprimand them,” Baswedan told The Associated Press in an interview last month without saying which country he was alluding to.\nBaswedan said human rights and environmental protection should underpin Indonesia’s foreign policy. “If we have no values, then there is a cost-benefit relationship, where we will only support countries that are profitable for us,” he said.\nMarty Natalegawa, a respected former Indonesian foreign minister, expressed hope that the elected leaders would not only say “we are not picking sides” but “actually contribute in helping create a more stable U.S.-China relations.”\nThe U.S. and China have both seen how the emergence of a new leader in the region can threaten their interests.\nRodrigo Duterte, after capturing the Philippine presidency on an anti-crime platform in 2016, became one of the most vocal critics in Asia of U.S. security policy while nurturing close ties with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nDuterte threatened to evict American military personnel who were in the Philippines for combat exercises. He later moved to terminate a defense agreement with Washington that allowed thousands of Americans to enter the country for largescale combat drills, but he ended that effort as he appealed to the U.S. to provide vaccines at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.\nDuterte's stormy term ended in 2016 and he was succeeded by Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who approved an expansion of the U.S. military presence at Philippine military bases under a 2014 defense pact. Marcos said his decision was aimed at bolstering his country’s territorial defenses at a created_at of increasing aggression by China's coast guard, navy and suspected militia forces in Philippine-claimed off-shore areas.\nChina protested the decision, saying it would provide American forces staging grounds in the northern Philippines across the sea border from the Taiwan Strait that could undermine Chinese national security.\nIndonesia and other state members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations belong to the Non-Aligned Movement, a Cold-War era bloc of mostly developing nations that aspire not to be formally associated with or against any major global power.\nStill, the rivalry between Washington and Beijing has permeated the region.\nCriticisms of China’s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed South China Sea have always been watered down in ASEAN, the 10-member regional bloc.\nState members aligned with Beijing, in particular Cambodia and Laos, have opposed any such reproach or attempt to name China as the object of criticism in joint communiques after their annual summits, several regional diplomats have told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity over the years because they lacked authority to speak publicly.\nLast year, the Philippine government accused the Chinese coast guard and suspected militia forces of using water cannons, a military-grade laser and dangerous maneuvers against Philippine coast guard patrol ships that caused minor collisions in a series of high-seas faceoffs in the disputed waters.\nUnder the chairmanship of Indonesia, ASEAN did not specifically mention China but only made general expressions of concern over aggressive behavior in the disputed waterway after their summit meetings.\n___\nAssociated Press journalists Jim Gomez in Jakarta and David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this report.\n"

Cmdr. Tim Cline, mission commander of the US Navy P-8A maricreated_at patrol aircraft said at that created_at that: \"Nothing unusual. Both parties... conducted themselves safely and professionally and normally, which is what we're always out here trying to do.\"\n\"The objective [of our operations here] is to normalize activity and normalize interactions with each other,\" he added.\nOn January 3, a Jiangkai-class Chinese frigate and a Chinese Luoyang-class destroyer also shadowed the second MCA of Manila and Washington in the West Philippine Sea.\nThese PLA-Navy warships appeared while BRP Gregorio del Pilar, BRP Davao del Sur (LD-602), and BRP Ramon Alcaraz (PS-16), along with US Navy destroyer USS Sterett (DDG- 104) were conducting their patrols.\nThe BRP Gregorio del Pilar and the PLA-Navy's Jiangkai-class Chinese frigate exchanged radio challenges, but no other untoward incidents occurred during that created_at.\nBeijing' actions are in line with its assertion of sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the western section of Manila's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). An international tribunal ruling in 2016, however, effectively dismissed this sweeping claim.\nAccording to Article 57 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a country has sovereign rights over its own EEZ, but other nations could still enjoy non-economic uses in other states' EEZ such as freedom of navigation as well as the right of overflight.\n___ (c)2024 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

    "text": "\nMore than half of humanity is heading to a ballot box in 2024 - the most in human history.\nAn expected Biden-Trump re-match in November will likely be the focus for many. But there are also elections in India - the most populous nation in the world - as well as in Russia, the UK, Indonesia and the European parliament.\nSome will rightly argue such events rarely affect financial markets in a sustained way. Elections, wars, trade wars and other geopolitical disturbances come and go, and markets trend higher and assets pay income.\nIndeed, the unfolding backdrop for markets is looking increasingly constructive this year. Growth is slowing (not collapsing), inflation is trending lower while central banks are positioning for mid-year cuts.\nBut 2024 is also shaping up as one of those years when this macro backdrop could still be challenged by politics that reach beyond domestic arenas and drive geopolitical volatility.\nThis will add to the volatility and dispersion we are already seeing, with the ups and downs in bond markets pushing volatility to its highest in 40 years, equal only to the global financial crisis. Equities are also seeing significant dispersion of returns, with some sectors in the US reporting season winning big (technology) and others struggling (healthcare and energy).\nIn 2024, with Donald Trump outpolling Joe Biden in surveys, markets are likely soon to turn their attention to pricing the potential impact of a more \"isolationist\" or \"America first\" regime emerging in 2025.\nCould the US scuttle Ukraine's efforts by removing its support? How committed is the US to defending Taiwan against a China incursion? Similarly, will the US continue to apply diplomatic pressure to calm Israel's actions in the Middle East, minimising the risk of escalation across borders?\nCloser to home, the South China Sea is a key shipping route vulnerable to disruption as well.\nDisruption may confront the global growth outlook should Trump introduce his mooted 10 per cent tariff on all imports. This would likely face global retaliatory actions. Using that revenue to fund tax cuts could also raise further concerns about the sustainability of US government spending, limiting how low US bond yields will settle, a key valuation metric for risk.\nIn India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears on track to secure a third term, helped by policies supporting lower income households. Some are arguing the \"price\" is increased centralisation of power, a threat to democracy. More positively, the focus on boosting digitalisation and manufacturing is likely to help India remain one of the fastest growing economies globally, securing a greater share of investment capital within emerging markets, including flows otherwise destined for China.\nWhat does all this mean? As markets battle to understand the implications of shifting politics and geopolitics, it suggests volatility and dispersion will be investors' constant companions through 2024 and 2025. Many of the geopolitical implications have an inflationary angle, supporting LGT Crestone's long-held view that inflation is unlikely to settle as low as it trended pre-pandemic.\nThese risks could also support the economic dominance of the US, and challenge consensus for a broadening out of a global recovery through 2025. Similarly, the US dollar - historically, a beneficiary when the world looks wobbly - might stay expensive for longer, challenging consensus for the Aussie dollar to rise to US74¢ by the end of 2025.\nThankfully, one of the keys to delivering long-term risk-adjusted returns - diversification - is likely to be the best defence against this politically led uncertainty, potential volatility and dispersion of returns.\nKey for portfolios will be ensuring local and offshore allocations across both equities and fixed income and, where accessible, unlisted alternatives. Alternatives also provide opportunities to minimise monthly volatility and build inflation protection into returns.\nVolatility is also driving many sophisticated investors to limit the size of their tactical \"bets\" across assets, instead letting well diversified portfolios be their defence. Focus has turned to taking more selective tactical opportunities in sub-asset classes when value emerges.\nFinally, many investors have been discovering the long-lost benefit of higher-yielding fixed income or bond-like assets in recent years as interest rates have risen. The mistake may be jettisoning these investments too soon on the basis that rates will adjust lower. With inflation likely to be higher than it was pre-pandemic and the potential for politics to unsettle the outlook, these fixed income investments could provide a much-needed defensive ballast to portfolios ahead.

    "text": "\nBooked out. Thursday was a public holiday in Indonesia and every ticket was sold on the 11.30am fast train service between the two commercial hubs of Jakarta and Bandung on the island of Java.\nThe Whoosh train takes just 30 minutes to travel about 142 kilometres between the two cities - a journey that can take five hours or more by road. The high-speed electric line is one of the fastest trains operating anywhere - if we could transplant to Australia, you could travel from Sydney to Canberra in about an hour.\nConstruction was not smooth. It took years longer and cost $US7.3 billion ($11.24 billion) - $US1.2 billion more than anticipated. Small landholders, many of them farmers, had to give way and it's yet to be seen if patronage will be enough to cover the investment.\nBut it is easily the most advanced transport system in Indonesia - where traffic snarls are notorious - and it was built with Chinese money.\nIn that way, the Whoosh train neatly sums up the past decade for Indonesia under President Joko Widodo.\nThis year the president commonly known as Jokowi will leave office after serving the maximum two terms. On Wednesday upwards of 160 million Indonesians are expected to head to polling stations to elect a new leader.\nThe outcome could have big repercussions for Australia's trade and investment links with Indonesia. It will also shape how we work with our northern neighbour to keep the precious sea lanes that go through Indonesian waters safe amid superpower rivalry and a China bent on advancing its territorial expansion and resource-grabbing in the South China Sea.\nWashington and Beijing are keenly watching the election. \nFormer US ambassador to Indonesia Robert Blake framed the moment in an interview with ASEAN Wonk this week: \"As the United States and China compete for influence in South-East Asia and beyond, Indonesia is seen as being one of a handful of large swing states - along with countries like Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and India - who will have an important geopolitical influence globally if they choose to exercise it. Indonesia senses this opportunity.\"\nThe three candidates to become Indonesia's next president - Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto and former provincial governors Anies Baswedan and Ganjar Pranowo - all know they need foreign investment if the country is to continue to grow its economy at the 5 per cent-plus rate it needs to get to the much sought-after high-income status.\nIn the past decade, Jokowi has built roads, ports, industrial parks, begun constructing a new capital city, and turbocharged nickel exports with his controversial downstreaming policy. Chinese investors have been in lockstep all the way with projects dotted around the Indonesian archipelago.\nInstagram link\nThere's a lot of history in the Indonesia-China nexus.\nIndonesia's founding president, Sukarno, negotiated a dual citizenship agreement with China in 1955. While formal links faded in the Suharto era, the president counted Liem Sioe Liong as a close friend. The Chinese billionaire's Salim Group was referred to as the business pillar of Suharto's Indonesia.\nThe political legacy continues with Jokowi, who belonged to the PDIP, the political party chaired by Sukarno's daughter Megawati Sukarnoputri.\nChinese money webs\nOnly 5 per cent of Indonesians are ethnic Chinese, but Chinese families dominate what Indonesians refer to as the oligarchy, where commercial power is concentrated. Chinese money webs stretch across South-East Asia, often with twin bases in mainland China and Hong Kong or Singapore.\nFor its part, Beijing has actively courted emerging economies like Indonesia through its Belt and Road program. The high-speed train between Bandung and Jakarta is part of this. China's Silk Road Fund has flagged its intention to invest up to 20 billion yuan ($4.28 billion) in partnership with Indonesia's Investment Authority, the INA.\nThen there are the multi-billion dollar investments in nickel mining, smelting and processing of battery-ready elements, much of which has come from the Tsingshan Holding Company. Tsingshan is also backing one of Jokowi's most ambitious projects, a massive new industrial park in Indonesian territory on the island of Borneo.\nIn January, BCA economists described the \"accelerating pace of FDI (foreign direct investment) growth\" as \"a constant theme in Indonesia's economy in the past years\". And among those investors, the BCA observed \"none seem as aggressive as those from China, whose dominance in the EV and renewable energy supply chains increases its demand for minerals\".\nAfter Singapore, which channels money from all over, Chinese and Hong Kong investors were the second and third-largest sources of FDI for Indonesia last year, ploughing in US$5.6 billion and US$5.2 billion respectively last year.\nThe China and Hong Kong share of Indonesia's foreign-investment pie has grown rapidly over the Jokowi decade. Official data shows they accounted for 28.6 per cent last year, up from just 5.1 per cent in 2014.\nAustralia is way down the list, though the official stats don't tell the full story, with much investment channelled through Singapore. The ASX-listed Metal Industries is a big player in Indonesian nickel and often works with Tsingshan. Orica and ANZ are also on the ground while Macquarie led a consortium that bought a minority stake in Indonesia's Bersama Digital Infrastructure in 2022 for $US610 million.\nThose close to the Australia-Indonesia investment channel say there is an increasing momentum. To date, though, no superannuation fund has gone in, despite encouragement from Canberra.\nShould fund managers come knocking, though, they may find the door opens a little easier post-election, depending on the result. The biggest difference in attitude can be found among the two candidates trailing Prabowo in the polls.\nCampaign stances on China\nAnies has said he would prioritise increasing co-operation with countries in the European Union and East Asia over China. Ganjar has vowed to continue projects initiated by Jokowi's government, including investment co-operation with China.\nGanjar, who leads the PDIP ticket,shows every sign of wanting to continue the party's links with China - though he has suggested ASEAN's much-derided code of conduct with Beijing over the South China Sea is not fit for purpose. Given the code has been discussed for two decades with no result, this is not a startling conclusion.\nIn one of the starkest differences between the three candidates, Anies is the only one to question the opportunity cost of building a $45 billion new capital city in the Indonesian province of East Kalimantan, on the island of Borneo. Nine companies have confirmed investment in Nusantara. Three are foreign, including China's Citic Construction and two from Malaysia.\nPoll leader Prabowo has promised to do largely as Jokowi has done, particularly in regard to the new capital and down streaming.Prabowo's campaign has softened the image of the former general who has faced credible accusations of human rights abuses. A soft-shoe step at rallies and posters plastered with cuddly avatars of the 72-year-old are better vote-catchers than foreign policy.\nAway from the campaign trail, though, geopolitics has been Prabowo's bread and butter since October 2019 when Jokowi made him defence minister. An off-the-cuff speech at the 2022 Shangri-La dialogue in Singapore gave an insight into his approach to China.\n\"China has been a great civilisation,\" Prabowo told the assembly of military and defence heavyweights from around the world.\n\"They have been leaders of Asia for many thousands of years. I've said that many created_ats. Their influence permeates all South-East Asia. So we urge everytext to respect the rightful rise of China, back to its position as a great civilisation.\"\nHowever, Prabowo also favours closer defence links with the United States. This would not extend to a formal treaty - that would breach Indonesia's treasured non-aligned status. It could echo discussions now underway between Jakarta and Canberra around a new defence partnership, an initiative born during Prabowo's tenure.\n'Dirty' nickel\nSo Indonesia has one candidate, Anies, determined to cast a wider net for foreign investment and another, Prabowo, keen to strengthen defence ties with the US and Australia. These two paths could both yield the same result; a bit more distance from Beijing. Especially when all of those Chinese investment dollars are causing a few headaches of their own.\nAndrew Forrest calls Indonesian nickel \"dirty\", and he's not alone. \nThere is increasing alarm about the environmental harm caused by the rapid industrialisation policy. An explosion at a Chinese-funded nickel processing plant at the Morawali Industrial Park that killed 18 people and injured many more made titles worldwide. These factors are getting in the way of Indonesian efforts to strike a deal with the US on critical minerals that would allow its exports of processed nickel ore to tap into the tax incentives offered by the Inflation Reduction Act.\nBhima Yudhistira Adinegara, executive director of the Jakarta-based Centre of Economic and Law Studies in Jakarta, says Indonesia's \"excessive exploitation\" of nickel, largely funded by Chinese interests, is creating problems.\n\"Indonesia is facing backlash from its nickel processing policy due to low attention to environmental standards, work accidents and negative impacts on local livelihoods.\" \nThe high-speed train funding experience may also have made Indonesia wary of future projects. The cost over-run forced Jokowi to use government funds to help get the project over the line.\nThe bottom line, though, is Indonesia needs foreign investment, and it's not inclined to be choosy.\nOn the ground many Indonesians would like to see more Western companies involved. From Java to Borneo, there is an acknowledgement that Chinese companies are \"very flexible\" - code for ready to oil the wheels of the patronage systems that operate at a provincial level.\nThe path for Western companies is slower when they refuse to pay more than official fees. That \"flexibility\", however, also extends to Chinese companies' attitudes toward safety and the environment. They also bring many thousands of their own workers. Local communities don't gain jobs or income.\nThis was addressed by Anies in a campaign visit to the nickel-rich region of North Maluku, where he said local communities had not benefited from the district's double-digit economic growth.\nYohanes Sulaiman, associate professor at Universitas Jenderal Achmad Yani in West Java, says there is room for more diversity.\n\"People say Jokowi is very close to China. But people in his inner circle say the only reason he is close to Beijing is because China is giving him all the incentives with all the investment.\"\nThese investments have not been forthcoming from the US and its treaty partners, Yohanes notes.\n\"If China is giving money, Jokowi will go for it. But if the US or Australia will give him a lot of money then he would switch right away.\"\nYohanes said the next administration - whoever leads it - will have the same approach. \"They will look at whoever is wiling to invest in Indonesia.\"\n"

    "created_at": "2024-02-14",
    "text": "\nCanberra: Parliament of Australia has issued the following speech:\nMr HASTIE (Canning) (19:30): Australia is at a critical moment in our history. After enjoying almost 70 years of relative peace, prosperity and strategic order, we are now entering a period of tension, hardship and strategic disorder.\nAuthoritarian powers are on the move. China and Russia deepened their strategic cooperation in February 2022 with their 'no limits' partnership. Since that created_at, Russia has drawn the sword against Ukraine, invading sovereign territory and killing thousands of people. China has flexed its muscles in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, with multiple provocations. Terrorism is back. Hamas attacked and murdered more than a thousand Israelis on 7 October, and Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, out of Yemen, fire missiles at drones and international shipping in the Red Sea, forcing up the cost of freight and compromising around12 per cent of global trade.\nDespite all our national advantages in geography and resources, the liberty of distance and abundance, we are a country that is dependent upon the security of the seas for our importation of goods, especially liquid fuels, and for our exports that underwrite our prosperity. We are a trading nation and vulnerable to this emerging strategic disorder. It would not take much to severely damage our prosperity, either through regional conflict or an adversary conducting supply chain warfare against our country. Now, more than ever, is the created_at to act to secure our future, which is why the Albanese government's weakness in defence is so inexcusable.\nThe created_ats demand strong leadership. Instead, we get weak leadership from the Prime Minister and his part-created_at defence minister. There is much to do, and this Labor government is failing to do it. Since April last year, we've known that the Albanese government is not serious about defence. The Defence Strategic Review in April last year revealed that there is no new money for defence. In fact, with inflation, the budget has gone backwards in real terms. This means they are making cuts to the ADF across the board—to Army, Navy and Air Force. Army has had its infantry fighting vehicles order slashed from 450 to 129. It's shrinking from three fighting brigades to one. Under the Albanese government, the Army is weaker, and our ability to prevail in land combat is diminished. That's the consequence of weak leadership.\nOur budget with the AUKUS commitment must grow; otherwise, we sacrifice other important capabilities and our readiness to fight. Sustainment budgets will be cannibalised, and the historical record reflects this, as we saw when we operated two aircraft carriers in the Royal Australian Navy.\nThis is fundamentally a question of leadership for the defence minister. We know that he lost at the ERC last year to Senator Penny Wong, the foreign minister. He needs to secure more money for the defence budget. The speed of the boss is the speed of the team, and the Minister for Defence agreed with this sencreated_atnt in October 2022, when he said that he takes responsibility for defence—that the buck stops with him. But under this minister we see a host of failings, and estimates has revealed that today—a deferral of tough decisions.\nIt was five months ago that the minister received the surface fleet review, and we are still waiting for his decision on it. It's causing massive uncertainty for defence industry and in South Australia.\nWe are yet to see a defence strategy, the most important thing you must do in defending the nation. You must know what the threat is and you must have a plan to defeat it. It shapes everything, particularly in the budget, and in a created_at of scarcity we need a strategy first and foremost. We won't see this until midyear at the earliest, only after the big decisions are taken on capabilities, platforms and equipment.\nThe paperwork piling up on the minister's desk has resulted in a 37-year delay on our most significant defence programs. The department is dysfunctional, with senior officials airing their grievances against the minister through the Australian Financial Review.\nThe Labor government haven't deployed a naval vessel to the Red Sea, a weak decision when you consider the US, the UK, France, Italy and other nations are stepping up. The Albanese government won't send otherwise serviceable Taipan helicopters to Ukraine even after our friends have asked for them, preferring to bury them along with our reputation as a tough-minded people who look after our mates. This government is weak in defence and that has caused a recruiting and retention crisis. We are not getting enough people joining and we are losing too many. I am worried for Australia, as are those on this side of the House. The Minister for Defence is on notice: show some strength, secure money for the ADF, make the hard decisions. If you can't by the May budget, resign and make way for someone who can. We can't afford to be weak any longer.\n"

    "title": "Why China and US must both court Indonesia; As regional tensions continue to rise, access to the Malacca Strait has never been so important",
    "created_at": "2024-02-14",
    "text": "\nWhen 16th-century Portuguese explorers first sailed to Malacca they were intent on making fortunes from the spice trade but realised soon enough that they had stumbled on a bigger prize: the gateway to mysterious Cathay. Now Cathay, still a puzzle, is modern communist China and control of the Strait of Malacca is largely in the hands of Indonesia.\nLittle wonder then that Indonesia, a complex archipelago, is of geopolitical interest ? it sits astride a strategic choke point, a stretch of water that links the Indian and the Pacific oceans. As the rivalry between China and Russia has intensified, so too has military planning around the strait. Block access to the South China Sea and you can interrupt 80 per cent of Chinese oil imports. Liquefied natural gas travels along this route to Chinese ports; so does Beijing's supply of rare metals and minerals from Africa. It would need a dramatic turn of events ? President Xi's forced annexation of Taiwan, say ? and a risk-hungry US president to take such a step. So who knows?\nOne thing is for sure, though: it really matters who rules Indonesia. In the past decade of fraying tensions between the US and China, Indonesia has been governed by President Widodo, known as Jokowi. He has made a good fist of it: the economy is growing fast, poverty rates are down, infrastructure projects are giving the country a modern sheen. Jokowi himself still seems to be popular and although his \"man of the people\" brand ? he was originally a furniture salesman ? is wearing thin, he has at least stepped down after two terms in accordance with the constitution.\nHis foreign policy, a form of nonalignment between the US and China, was conducted nimbly. China is Indonesia's top trading partner but Jokowi managed to leverage the relationship to his country's advantage. Its most valuable natural resource is nickel, essential in the energy transition and for China's ambitions to be the leading producer of electric vehicles. Jokowi started off by banning raw nickel exports in 2014. China understood that if it wanted a slice of Indonesia's nickel it would have to plough money into processing the metal in Indonesia. Result: Indonesia has become the world's largest processed nickel exporter, 70 per cent of which goes to China.\nAt home Jokowi is credited with having successfully managed the commercial relationship at a created_at when other countries are falling into Beijing's debt trap. But today's presidential and legislative elections are likely to throw up a less deft leader. All three candidates for the presidency claim that they will stay neutral in the great power contest but all will find it hard to navigate around Beijing's political demands. China wants a friend at the helm of a country that controls its maricreated_at approaches. Having a well-mannered trading partner as a near-neighbour is no longer enough.\nJust as Nato is scrambling to adjust to the prospect of a second Trump presidency, so China too is gearing up for new leadership in Washington. The assumption that Beijing would prefer a Trump victory seems less and less applicable as the candidate reheats his rhetoric on tariffs against Chinese imports. China's evolving line is that it will demand of its partners, especially its neighbours, a him-or-us choice. Indonesians know this. The created_at of strategic ambiguity is passing.\nJokowi's obvious favourite as successor in the three-horse election race is a hard-nosed former general, Prabowo Subianto, no friend of America or Australia (both banned him because of claims of involvement in atrocities). Prabowo has had a makeover (he's promising free school milk) and has chosen Jokowi's son, Gibran, as a running-mate. Analysts say he comes from the genus of genuflecting strongman: that is, likely to crack down on any hint of separatism but eager to accommodate Beijing. Indonesian voters seem to think that makes him credible. He is polling at more than 50 per cent.\nThe most plausible rival is Anies Baswedan, a former Fulbright scholar and former governor of Jakarta, who argues that the country's foreign policy has become too transactional and passive and promises a \"valuebased\" world view. Western investors like him because of his economic expertise. That doesn't amount to an anti-China position but it does suggest that he wouldn't, as leader, rush into a position of subservience towards Beijing. Polling shows him significantly behind. His best hope this week is to force Prabowo into a second-round run-off.\nAcross the so-called Global South, similar choices are taking shape. In some ways it resembles the competition between the Soviet Union and the US-led West in the Cold War. That involved a great deal of influence-buying, the sponsorship of rebel groups, handouts to friendly politicians, the shaping of a binary choice between East and West even for those not keen to align.\nThe current climate has those elements too but is rendered more acute by the increasingly unstable world order. The maricreated_at choke points ? not only Malacca but also the Red Sea, the Black Sea and the Taiwan straits ? highlight everyone's vulnerability to interrupted supply chains, to the military option of blockade. China, a great exporting power, is as nervous as its western rivals. It is investing heavily in a naval build-up and satellite tracking, and in land routes that can help it to sidestep dangerous shipping lanes.\nElections come and go, some more flawed than others, but the defining power of geography is a constant. Indonesia's vote this week is not only about free school milk but also about the stewardship of the strait at a created_at when the world is all at sea.\nChina wants a friend at the helm, a trading partner isn't enough\n"

    "created_at": "2024-02-14",
    "text": "\nIn the complex political fabric of , the figure of the former general emerges with determination, who is emerging as the future president of the country, despite his murky past as an army strongman during the dictatorship. His unwavering ambition to take command of the world's third largest democracy and to lead the emerging economic giant, has led him on a possible path to victory in the first round, capturing the support of a significant part of the Indonesian electorate.\nAgainst the backdrop of an election of titanic proportions, the country experienced a historic day on Wednesday despite the adversities caused by heavy storms and floods, with more than two hundred million citizens determined to participate in what was called the \"party of democracy\".  Nearly 259,000 candidates entered the fray in a fierce battle for the 20,600 coveted political posts scattered across the vast 17,000-island archipelago. The focus, however, has been on the exciting race to succeed popular President Joko Widodo, whose influence is decisive for the country's future. Official results may take up to 35 days to be released, the maximum created_at allowed by law.\nThe figure of Prabowo stands as a prominent protagonist, whose rise to the helm is of vital importance, as his leadership could shape the destiny of a nation of considerable global relevance. The \"quick counts\", meticulously carried out by various organizations after the election, suggest that the military man has managed to gather the necessary votes to avoid a run-off election in June, where he would face either Ganjar Pranowo or Anies Baswedan, his closest contenders.\nDespite his political ambitions, Prabowo has experienced several consecutive defeats in his relentless quest for power. Indeed, in 2009 he ran for the vice presidency alongside former president Megawati Sukarnoputri, relying on his hardline stance and backed by his past in the Indonesian special forces, the Kopassus. However, this first foray resulted in a resounding failure. Unwilling to give up he ran again in 2014 as a leading candidate, but his opponent was \"Jokowi\", a younger and more modern politician, so he only managed to get 46% of the vote, thus facing another setback in the political arena.\nThis created_at, Jokowi himself surprised by giving tacit support to the seventy-two year old veteran belonging to the old ruling elite, instead of backing his own party's candidate. Significantly, Prabowo has selected as his running mate Gibran Rakabuming Raka, the thirty-six-year-old son of the leader and current mayor of the leader's hometown, which does not seem to be a mere coincidence.\nBiography\nKnown as \"General TikTok\" for his eagerness to attract the youth vote through social networks, and despite his role as Minister of Defense, Prawobo has sought to reinvent himself and offer a more conciliatory image that distances him from his murky record. However, the former son-in-law of dictator Suharto faces accusations of overseeing kidnappings of pro-democracy activists and of being responsible for atrocities in the province of East Timor in the 1990s, casting an ominous shadow over his record.\nYet behind the scenes in the political arena, his opponents are quick to point to his past. Born in 1951 into one of the country's most affluent families, whose prosperity was forged during the years of dictatorship, his lineage has come under scrutiny. His grandfather, who emerged as the founder of one of the nation's leading banks, the BNI, and his brother, the influential businessman Hashim Djojohadikusumo, who holds a prominent place on the list of Asia's wealthiest men according to the prestigious Forbes magazine, are pillars that have shaped his environment and whose influence is attributed to his political campaign.\nWidodo's future successor will find himself at the helm of a booming economy, with impressive growth and ambitious infrastructure projects underway. One of the most prominent challenges is the monumental task of relocating Indonesia's capital from congested Jakarta to the island of Borneo, at a staggering estimated cost in excess of $30 billion.\nIndonesia enjoys a strategic geographic location and membership in key international organizations such as the United Nations, G20 and ASEAN underscores its importance in global affairs. In the Southeast Asian region, where world powers have long clashed over issues such as Taiwan independence, human rights, U.S. military presence and Beijing's assertive actions in disputed waters, especially in the South China Sea, Indonesia represents an important economic as well as political arena.\nUnder the leadership of the outgoing president, Indonesia's foreign policy has adopted a posture of avoiding overt criticism of both Beijing and Washington in order to stay on a path of non-alignment with either power. This approach has facilitated Chinese trade and investment in the country, including the development of a $7.3 billion high-speed railroad largely funded by the Asian giant. At the same created_at, Jakarta has stepped up defense cooperation and increased military exercises with the United States.\nHow Prawobo will govern\nAccording to experts, the new leader is more skilled in regional security matters than his predecessor, and is expected to take a more assertive approach to China's maricreated_at actions, with the aim of positioning his country as a major regional and global security player. As a fervent nationalist of long standing, he holds the conviction that he deserves to play a leading role in global institutions, and will spare no effort to ensure a more active participation in major international forums, such as the G20, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summits and other similar events.\nOn the other hand, it has not long ago expressed concern over Beijing's maricreated_at actions, praising the AUKUS agreement, a trilateral alliance between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States focused on submarines. However, despite his more assertive stance, he has also expressed his intention to continue Jokowi's strategy of fostering relations with both Washington and Beijing, in the interest of maintaining a diplomatic balance.\n"

    "text": "\nManila should take note of how Malaysia and Vietnam have managed to make the most of their maricreated_at resources while navigating their territorial disputes with China, and rethink its own approach\nThe Philippines is Asean's most vocal and seemingly assertive challenger to China's claims in the South China Sea. Public opinion supports taking military action, and Manila is actively seeking international support, strengthening its alliance with the US and building up its coastguard presence. \nBut despite these efforts, tangible gains remain elusive. Compared to Vietnam and Malaysia, the Philippines appears to be lagging behind in both resource exploitation and physical control of disputed areas. \nVietnam has undertaken significant land reclamation in the Spratlys since December 2022, adding an estimated 134 hectares (330 acres) to its existing land holdings in the Spratlys. This expansion is second only to China's in size. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nIn stark contrast, the Philippines has seen its presence in the region decline. It lost its presence on Scarborough Shoal in 2012 and continues to face Chinese interference in its attempts to consolidate its position on Second Thomas Shoal. Although Manila has legal backing from the South China Sea arbitration ruling and the support of allies, its control over Second Thomas Shoal looks increasingly fragile. \nIn terms of oil and gas development, Malaysia's oil and gas industry plays a crucial role in its economy, accounting for around 20 per cent of GDP. The South China Sea is a major contributor to this sector, but many explored blocks overlap with areas claimed by China, particularly north of Sarawak. Despite these challenges, Malaysia's exploration has been relatively stable compared to the Philippines' efforts in the Reed Bank, which have seen limited progress. \nWhy does China tolerate such extensive reclamation by Vietnam, while not allowing the Philippines to fortify its tiny presence aboard the BRP Sierra Madre at Second Thomas Shoal? Why has Malaysia been able to manage large-scale oil and gas development in the South China Sea while the Philippines faces significant challenges in developing its resources? \nWhy have Vietnam and Malaysia been able to assert their maricreated_at rights while maintaining stable diplomatic relations with China, yet the Philippines has had constant friction with Beijing, and their relations have continued to deteriorate? \nSeveral factors may contribute to this disparity. First, the Philippines relies heavily on the US alliance. However, despite the mutual defence treaty, the US commitment to direct military involvement remains ambiguous, leaving the Philippines potentially exposed in the event of escalation. \nAlthough the US seeks to contain China and undermine Beijing's international standing, it appears to have no intention of engaging in direct armed conflict over a few tiny and insignificant disputed reefs such as Second Thomas Shoal. This is why the US has not categorised ship-ramming and the firing of water cannons and laser lights as clear-cut armed attacks, instead accepting them as so-called grey-zone tactics. \nManila might have thought that by cooperating with Washington in its efforts to contain Beijing, even on the Taiwan issue, it would gain the full support of the US in the South China Sea. However, such unrealistic expectations could lead to significant strategic miscalculations by the Philippines. \nSecond, some within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations may perceive the Philippines' approach towards China as a departure from its core values of neutrality and centrality, as reflected in the bloc's negotiations with Beijing on a code of conduct in the South China Sea. \nHowever, recent developments suggest that Manila may be moving towards a more deterrence-based strategy. There are concerns that the expansion of the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement between Manila and Washington could further militarise the region, with potentially unforeseen consequences. \nThird, the Philippines' attempt to garner international support to pressure China into backing off may well backfire, as such a strategy could fuel Chinese nationalism and hinder constructive dialogue and diplomatic solutions. \nIn a recent commentary, maricreated_at expert Wu Shicun argued that peace and stability in the South China Sea cannot be achieved by China's restraint and forbearance alone, and urged Beijing to take firm action and \"show our swords when necessary\". \nGiven the importance of saving face in Chinese diplomacy, it is implausible that China would back down as a result of any accusations, regardless of their veracity. The Chinese believe respect begets respect, and see tit-for-tat diplomacy as fair play. Yet, the Philippines does not seem to understand this logic of Chinese diplomacy. \nFinally, Manila's approach to the South China Sea dispute is shaped not only by external factors but also by complex internal dynamics. The country's political landscape is characterised by political dynasties, competing factions and, according to some critics, widespread corruption. These internal factors may significantly shape the government's approach to territorial and maricreated_at disputes. \nMany Filipino politicians prioritise their personal interests and those of their families, often to the detriment of the nation. Exploiting the \"China threat\" for personal political gain diverts resources and attention away from critical investments in maricreated_at capabilities and infrastructure. \nThe South China Sea dispute is a multifaceted and evolving challenge for the Philippines. Recognising its current limitations and adapting its approach could be key to more effectively navigating this complex situation and securing its long-term interests. Learning from the experiences of other regional actors, such as Vietnam and Malaysia, could be a valuable step in this direction. \nZhihua Zheng is an associate professor and head of the East Asia Marine Policy Project at the Centre for Japanese Studies, Shanghai Jiao Tong University\nCopyright (c) 2024.

    "text": "\nThe Philippine authorities have advocated on Thursday to negotiate a \"code of conduct\" between China and the rest of Southeast Asian countries to \"end the confrontations\" in the South China Sea.      Philippine Foreign Minister Enrique Manalo said that the tensions are not only due to the \"rivalry\" between the United States and China, but that other countries, such as the Philippines, \"have legitimate rights and interests to defend\" in the area. \nTo the contrary, he has said, \"will not help to really understand the situation.\"     \"It obscures good judgment, somecreated_ats rationalizing actions that are clearly illegal under international law and contrary to the UN charter under the pretext of this rivalry,\" he said, before expressing his concern about the tension in the area. He urged all parties to remain in \"direct\" contact with each other.     The idea of a code of conduct was hatched more than two decades ago, but the parties did not commit to initiating the process until 2017. However, no progress has been made in negotiations on its content. \"We are concerned about developments in our exclusive economic zone,\" he has said.     The Philippines and China have recorded several clashes over the past year over the South China Sea dispute. Manila has accused Beijing of committing \"aggressive\" acts against its vessels in its exclusive economic zone. China, for its part, has accused the Philippines of \"invading\" its territory.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines is Asean's most vocal and seemingly assertive challenger to China's claims in the South China Sea. Public opinion supports taking military action, and Manila is actively seeking international support, strengthening its alliance with the US and building up its coastguard presence.  \nBut despite these efforts, tangible gains remain elusive. Compared to Vietnam and Malaysia, the Philippines appears to be lagging in both resource exploitation and physical control of disputed areas.  \nVietnam has undertaken significant land reclamation in the Spratlys since December 2022, adding an estimated 134 hectares to its existing land holdings.  \nThis expansion is second only to China's in size.  \nIn stark contrast, the Philippines has seen its presence in the region decline. It lost its presence on Scarborough Shoal in 2012 and continues to face Chinese interference in its attempts to consolidate its position on Second Thomas Shoal.  \nAlthough Manila has legal backing from the South China Sea arbitration ruling and the support of allies, its control over Second Thomas Shoal looks increasingly fragile. \nIn terms of oil and gas development, Malaysia's oil and gas industry plays a crucial role in its economy, accounting for around 20 per cent of GDP. The South China Sea is a major contributor to this sector, but many explored blocks overlap with areas claimed by China, particularly north of Sarawak.  \nDespite these challenges, Malaysia's exploration has been relatively stable compared to the Philippines' efforts in the Reed Bank, which have seen limited progress. \nWhy does China tolerate such extensive reclamation by Vietnam, while not allowing the Philippines to fortify its tiny presence aboard the BRP Sierra Madre at Second Thomas Shoal? Why has Malaysia been able to manage large-scale oil and gas development in the South China Sea while the Philippines faces significant challenges in developing its resources?  \nWhy have Vietnam and Malaysia been able to assert their maricreated_at rights while maintaining stable diplomatic relations with China, yet the Philippines has had constant friction with Beijing, and their relations have continued to deteriorate? \nSeveral factors may contribute to this disparity. First, the Philippines relies heavily on the US alliance. However, despite the mutual defence treaty, the US commitment to direct military involvement remains ambiguous, leaving the Philippines potentially exposed in the event of escalation. \nAlthough the US seeks to contain China and undermine Beijing's international standing, it appears to have no intention of engaging in direct armed conflict over a few tiny and insignificant disputed reefs such as Second Thomas Shoal. This is why the US has not categorised ship-ramming and the firing of water cannons and laser lights as clear-cut armed attacks, instead accepting them as so-called grey-zone tactics.  \nManila might have thought that by cooperating with Washington in its efforts to contain Beijing, even on the Taiwan issue, it would gain the full support of the US in the South China Sea. However, such unrealistic expectations could lead to strategic miscalculations by the Philippines.  \nSecond, some within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations may perceive the Philippines' approach towards China as a departure from its core values of neutrality and centrality, as reflected in the bloc's negotiations with Beijing on a code of conduct in the South China Sea. However, recent developments suggest that Manila may be moving towards a more deterrence-based strategy. There are concerns that the expansion of the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement between Manila and Washington could further militarise the region, with potentially unforeseen consequences.  \nThird, the Philippines' attempt to garner international support to pressure China into backing off may well backfire, as such a strategy could fuel Chinese nationalism and hinder constructive dialogue and diplomatic solutions. In a recent commentary, maricreated_at expert Wu Shicun argued that peace and stability in the South China Sea cannot be achieved by China's restraint and forbearance alone, and urged Beijing to take firm action and \"show our swords when necessary\".  \nGiven the importance of saving face in Chinese diplomacy, it is implausible that China would back down as a result of any accusations, regardless of their veracity. The Chinese believe respect begets respect, and see tit-for-tat diplomacy as fair play. Yet, the Philippines does not seem to understand this logic. \nFinally, Manila's approach to the South China Sea dispute is shaped not only by external factors but also by complex internal dynamics. The country's political landscape is characterised by political dynasties, competing factions and, according to some critics, widespread corruption. These internal factors may significantly shape the government's approach to territorial and maricreated_at disputes. \nMany Filipino politicians prioritise their personal interests and those of their families, often to the detriment of the nation. Exploiting the \"China threat\" for personal political gain diverts resources and attention away from critical investments in maricreated_at capabilities and infrastructure. \nThe South China Sea dispute is a multifaceted and evolving challenge for the Philippines. Recognising its current limitations and adapting its approach could be key to more effectively navigating this complex situation and securing its long-term interests. Learning from the experiences of other regional actors, such as Vietnam and Malaysia, could be a valuable step in this direction. \nZhihua Zheng is an associate professor and head of the East Asia Marine Policy Project at the Centre for Japanese Studies, Shanghai Jiao Tong University\n"

    "text": "\n 15 Feb 2024 (Philippines News Agency) Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo on Thursday said there is no new directive to soften actions in asserting the country's sovereign rights over the West Philippine Sea (WPS).\nIn a media forum in Manila, the Filipino top diplomat said the Philippines has always and will maintain a policy to manage disputes diplomatically and peacefully while firmly defending its maricreated_at rights over the area.\n'So, our position has not changed, it remains the same. I think that's how we will proceed in whatever future discussions we have,' he said.\nManalo said the government would also sustain a policy of transparency in the WPS, noting that the country's actions have been consistently 'hinged on international law'.\nThe statement was in response to a question whether Manila will retain its so-called \"assertive transparency,\" which involves publicizing illegal and unilateral actions conducted within Philippine waters.\n'The Philippines' role as vanguard of the rule of law, particularly the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as the fundamental and only arbiter of the overlapping claims and disputes in the South China Sea, can be seen as an extension of Philippine good global citizenship as a peacemaker, rule-shaper and consensus-builder, as much as it is about Philippine territorial integrity and national sovereignty,' he said.\nManalo said Manila's 'principled rules-based approach on the South China Sea/West Philippine Sea' is also a reflection that Manila is championing 'nothing less, and nothing more, than what is just'.\n'When a state becomes a party to a Treaty, it is under a legal obligation to bring its laws and conduct into conformity with the Treaty,' he said, referring to the UNCLOS.\n'Efforts seeking to shape and use rules, going against international law, should be opposed or not accepted,' he added.\nIn 2016, an Arbitral Tribunal issued a landmark award that invalidated China's expansive claims in the South China Sea.\nThe ruling was based on the UNCLOS, which both China and the Philippines are parties.\nLast Jan. 17, the two nations met for the 8th Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea (BCM) and discussed ways to 'de-escalate the situation in the South China Sea'.\nBoth sides agreed to 'calmly deal with incidents, if any, through diplomacy'.\nNot part of US-China rivalry\nIn the same forum, Manalo reiterated that the South China Sea disputes are not at all centered on the US-China rivalry.\nHe stressed that the region is composed of a number of nations and is not shaped by just one or two powers.\n'Subscribing strictly to the prism of this rivalry does not help in an honest understanding of the situation. Firstly, it puts distinct and legitimate rights and interests of countries such as the Philippines aside, and secondary to the interests of the rivals,' he said.\n'Secondly, it purposely obscures good judgment: actions that are clearly illegal in international law and against the UN Charter are somecreated_ats rationalized under the pretext of this rivalry,' he added.\n"

    "text": "\n China will be under a 'very clear obligation' to comply with measures that apply in marine protected areas in the South China Sea as signatory of the landmark United Nations High Seas Treaty, according to a Japanese international law expert.\nIn an interview with The STAR, professor Kentaro Nishimoto of Tohoku University emphasized that the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement, adopted last year, is the first-ever legally binding international treaty to govern and protect international waters, conserve and sustainably use marine biodiversity beyond the areas of national jurisdiction.\n'The term beyond area of national jurisdiction means beyond the exclusive economic zone and beyond the continental shelf. So it is the part of the ocean which does not belong to any particular state's jurisdiction and in that area in the high seas the new agreement will allow taking measures to protect the marine diversity, especially in the form of marine protected areas,' Nishimoto said.\n'It is very important to consider using this tool to protect biodiversity of the South China Sea,' he said.\nAccording to Nishimoto, it is a tool that can be used to designate a protected area on the high seas.\nA scientific and technical text will be established under the agreement to assess a proposal to establish marine protected area. A conference of the parties will decide and vote.\nThe Philippines, after its ratification and the treaty comes into force, may decide to table a proposal to establish marine protected areas because of its very rich biodiversity.\n'It will serve a very big purpose concerning marine biodiversity and it will also be a way to show support for the rule of law in the South China Sea because this will be consistent with what the arbitral award said,' Nishimoto said. 'So we can take steps to protect biodiversity while at the same created_at taking the position that there is a high seas area.'\nChina has yet to ratify the agreement.\n'The South China Sea claim is very crucial even though it has no grounds in international law. I think we can see a situation where China opposes the efforts to establish marine protected area under this agreement,' Nishimoto said.\nEven as China, a signatory, does not ratify the agreement, Nishimoto said, 'I do not think there is anything in the procedure of the treaty to allow China to block the marine protected area.'\n'But even if that is the case, China is under a more general obligation to protect and preserve marine environment so under the law it will not be able to do everything that it wants freely. There is a possibility to disregard a measure that is in place. I think there is a possibility given China's very bad track record of activities in the South China Sea,' he added.\nHe explained that the BBNJ is focused on biodiversity and not a bilateral dispute issue.\n'I think there will be an outcry from the international society if that kind of issue happens. China may still even disregard that but I think it will create a considerable pressure on China to be at least considerate of the marine biodiversity of the South China Sea,' he stated.\nKenichi Matsuda, deputy chief of mission of the Japanese embassy in Manila, reaffirmed Japan's commitment to the rule of law and collaboration with like-minded partners in ensuring maricreated_at freedom and environmental protection.\n'As enhancing the rule of law is one of Japan's foreign policy pillars, we are determined to work together hand-in-hand with other like-minded partners, especially with the Philippines, to ensure that universally accepted values and principles (are upheld),' Matsuda said.\nThe Philippines signed the High Seas Treaty in September 2023. It was finalized in June 2023 after nearly two decades.\n"

    "text": "\nA bill to challenge the ownership of China's artificial islands in Southeast Asia's contested waters is moving through the Congress of the Philippines, an ally the United States is treaty-bound to defend in the event of an attack.\nAn amendment approved on Wednesday by the Senate in Manila would allow the Philippine government to lay claim to any man-made feature that falls within its exclusive economic zone. That could include at least three reefs in the disputed Spratly Islands archipelago that have been fully militarized by China in the past decade.\nAn EEZ refers to waters that extend 200 nautical miles beyond a country's coastline, somecreated_ats called the \"baseline.\" Under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, nations do not have sovereignty over these waters, but are granted a sovereign right to exploit the natural resources within them.\nBeijing cites vague \"historical rights\" to justify its claim to all of the land features and surrounding maricreated_at zones in the energy-rich South China Sea, an assertion that is at odds with the positions of at least half a dozen neighboring states, all of which rely on the waters to boost their livelihoods and economic prosperity.\nIn the Philippines, Senate Bill 2492, also known as the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, seeks to further clarify geographical boundaries in the area as well as give the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. the legal powers to enforce exclusive rights in its EEZ, or what Manila calls the West Philippine Sea.\n\"All artificial islands constructed within the Philippine EEZ shall belong to the Philippine government,\" read a line added to the bill by its main sponsor, Sen. Francis Tolentino.\nThe amendment, described by Philippine Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri as \"very good,\" passed without opposition, allowing lawmakers to continue their deliberations over the text, which received public backing from Marcos shortly after its introduction last July.\n\"Understanding and upholding maricreated_at zones law is not merely a legal obligation, but a paramount necessity for our nation's security, economic prosperity and environmental well-being,\" Tolentino said in November when his bill moved from committee onto the Senate floor.\n\"The Philippine exclusive economic zone and territorial waters are not just lines on the map. They are the lifeblood of our maricreated_at activities. They provide us with exclusive rights to exploit and manage marine resources, including fisheries, minerals and energy,\" he said.\nThe language in Tolentino's bill sticks closely to the provisions of 1982's UNCLOS, ratified by the Philippines in 1984, and which China formally approved in 1996.\nIn 2016, the Law of the Sea Treaty became the authority under which an arbitral tribunal in The Hague rejected China's ownership claims in the South China Sea. Beijing never recognized the ruling in Philippines v. China and continues to argue that its processes were flawed.\nTolentino said last year that his bill would \"provide the country with a strong diplomatic negotiating tool in pursuing our interests.\"\nThe senator's office did not immediately respond to a written request for comment before publication.\nDiplomatic protests by successive presidents in Manila—as well as their counterparts in Washington—have failed to stop China's island building in the Spratlys, where aerial photographs show reclaimed land at Mischief, Subi and Fiery Cross reefs, hosting Chinese military barracks, roads, airfields and radar domes.\nMore urgent, however, is the vulnerability of other Manila-held features in the area, such as Second Thomas Shoal, where resupply missions to a rusting warship-turned-outpost have faced stiff opposition from Beijing, which aims to slowly erode the Philippines' control, observers say.\nFollowing China's seizure of nearby Scarborough Shoal in a standoff in 2012, the potential loss of another territory would further deny Philippine fisherfolk access to traditional fishing grounds in exclusive-use waters recognized under international maricreated_at law.\nChina's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to Newsweek's request for comment, but its Defense Ministry last month said it would not allow any moves by the Philippines to fortify existing outposts in the Spratlys.\nThe hard-line positions in both capitals—and the gaping power gap between them—also pose a policy dilemma for the U.S., which since 2019 has publicly extended its decades-old Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines to include attacks in the vast South China Sea.\nIt is yet another potential flashpoint in a region described by American leaders as an absolute priority, despite continued U.S. security commitments in Europe and the Middle East.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nPhilippine Senate Moves To Claim China-Built Islands\nGetty Images/Ezra Acayan\nBuildings and structures are seen on the artificial island built by China in Subi Reef on October 25, 2022, in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea.

    "text": "\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) has not been told to tone down its \"assertive transparency strategy\" to counter Beijing's grey-zone tactics in the South China Sea, a senior official said, a month after both countries agreed to resolve any incident in the area through diplomacy. \n\"We will continue [with the strategy],\" PCG Commodore Jay Tarriela told a forum in Manila.  \nTarriela, who is the adviser to the coastguard commandant for maricreated_at security, credited the strategy with raising awareness among people from various countries about China's encroachment into Philippine territorial waters. \nHe was speaking at the forum sponsored by Stratbase ADR Institute, a Philippine research organisation, and Australian Aid, Canberra's international aid agency. \nThe assertive transparency strategy involves embedding foreign and local media during PCG's missions to Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal, where Chinese fishermen, coastguard and navy ships had blocked and hosed down Philippine vessels in several incidents in the past year. PCG also releases information about the incidents online. \nSuch Chinese transgressions are referred to as grey-zone actions to underscore Beijing's territorial claims without engaging in open warfare. \nTarriela's comments came after officials from the Philippines and China attended the 8th Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea in Shanghai last month for talks aimed at reducing tensions and aiding bilateral communications over the contested waters.  \nHe said the PCG had not been told to change its assertive transparency strategy following that January 17 meeting.  \nThe strategy is in contrast to the quiet diplomacy undertaken by former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte in response to similar Chinese actions. Duterte had justified his measured approach, saying publicising such maricreated_at confrontations would incite China into adopting a more aggressive stance. \nIt was near the end of Duterte's term that Manila disclosed it had filed 211 diplomatic notes with China - 153 of them were in 2021 when relations started to sour between the two nations. \nTarriela said the PCG's strategy, which started last year during President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr's administration, \"enables ordinary citizens to viscerally experience the full measure of [Chinese] grey-zone aggression, which gives the government increased political latitude to take the hard steps required to push back [Beijing]\".  \nHe said any messaging linked to the strategy was first processed by an information working group comprising the PCG, the defence department, the Philippine military, the foreign affairs department, the justice department and the national security council. \n\"I have to be honest with everyone. Not everything we experience in the West Philippine Sea is openly released to the public,\" he divulged. He said the working group first ensured that any released information would not cause panic to or misinterpretation by the public. \n\"Our efforts to publicise compelling videos and images that truthfully document Chinese illegal actions in the West Philippine Sea have garnered international attention and condemnation. More countries now are expressing their criticism and standing in solidarity with Manila against Beijing's bullying behaviour and blatant disregard for international law,\" Tarriela said. \nUS Air Force Captain Benjamin Goirigolzarri told the forum that the PCG's strategy was a tool to tackle \"asymmetric challenges\" and \"shifts the calculus\" on grey-zone aggression by \"imposing steep international reputational cost to the bad actors\". \nGoirigolzarri is a team member of Stanford University's Gordian Knot Centre for National Security Innovation who is involved in Project Myoushu, which seeks to develop more effective tools to counter China's grey-zone actions. \nA free press can offer a \"compelling narrative in the face of Chinese misinformation\", Goirigolzarri said. \"Philippine vessels are armed with journalists ready to document run-ins with the Chinese militia to put on display to the world the bullying that the Chinese are doing in the South China Sea.\"  \nVictor \"Dindo\" Manhit, president of the Stratbase ADR Institute, credited the strategy for the rise in public support for Manila's maricreated_at sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea.  \nThe area includes the Second Thomas Shoal, known by Manila as Ayungin Shoal, where the Philippine military had beached a vessel to serve as an outpost. China lays claim to the shoal and refers to it as Ren'ai Jiao. \nTo ease tensions, Philippine foreign affairs undersecretary Theresa Lazaro and China's assistant foreign minister Nong Rong had agreed to improve maricreated_at communication between the foreign ministries and coastguards of both countries, according to a statement issued by the Philippine foreign office on January 18.  \nBoth sides also committed to avoid any \"escalation of tension\", the statement added. \nThe foreign ministry issued a separate statement addressing the same points including to \"properly handle maricreated_at emergencies, in particular, the situation on the ground at Ren'ai Jiao\".\n"

    "created_at": "2024-02-15",
    "text": "\nBeijing has protested the death of two Chinese fishermen whose boat capsized Wednesday after being chased by a Taiwanese patrol boat in Quemoy waters. According to the official Taipei agency CNA, the Republic of China Coast Guard detected four men aboard a speedboat about two kilometers east of Beiding Island, one of the smallest islands in the Quemoy archipelago, also known as Kinmen.\nThat island under Taipei's control is 250 kilometers from the island of Taiwan, but less than eight kilometers from the nearest mainland Chinese port. The Republic of China patrol boats demanded the vessel to stop for inspection but the crew opted to turn around in an attempt to gain their home port. During the chase, the outboard motorboat capsized. Two of the crew were pronounced dead from drowning in Quemoy while two others were revived and released.\nThe \"cruel incident\" has raised criticism in the People's Republic of China, which says it treats fishermen on the other side \"who go astray\" much more humanely, compared to the guidelines of the ruling pro-sovereignty party in Taipei. Reference has also been made to \"rough and dangerous maneuvers\" by the Taiwanese coast guard.\nThe latter, for their part, accuse the Chinese on the other side of fishing with explosives in waters they consider their own. At other created_ats, these so-called fishing boats are engaged in \"fishing\" for construction sand. The outboard in question, whose two survivors have been taken to court, had no registration number, according to Taiwanese police.\nA Beijing spokeswoman has demanded that Taipei \"immediately investigate\" the incident, \"respect\" fishing operations in the area by \"fishermen from both sides of the (Formosa) Strait\" and \"ensure the personal safety\" of Chinese fishermen to \"prevent such incidents from happening again.\"\nThe Quemoy archipelago has a dozen islets and islands, two of which are inhabited, while the rest are military fortifications. At some points, it is barely two kilometers from the metropolis of Xiamen, in mainland China, and two hundred kilometers from Taiwan. In fact, the sixty thousand local inhabitants do not consider themselves Taiwanese. Their allegiance is with the Republic of China, made up of several archipelagos in addition to the island of Taiwan. The best known of these is Pescadores, while another, Matsu, shares with Quemoy the extreme closeness to the People's Republic of China and the remoteness of Taiwan. from the main island of Taiwan. As well as the preponderance of the old Kuomintang, much more voted there than the sovereigntists of the Democratic Progressive Party.\nThe Quemoy Islands are currently a tourist destination for the Taiwanese, but in the past they were a point of friction between Mao's China and Chiang Kai-shek's China. Unlike Formosa, today better known as Taiwan, the archipelago was never a colony of Japan. Twice in the 1950s, it came close to provoking a nuclear conflict.\nChiang Kai-shek stationed 100,000 soldiers there, who were to be the vanguard of a future reconquest of all of China. The seditious officer Agustín Muñoz Grandes, who led the Blue Division and was decorated by Hitler, also visited Quemoy at the invitation of Chiang Kai-shek. In fair correspondence, Taiwanese officers were invited to visit the Alcazar of Toledo during Franco's regime.\nUntil the late 1970s, the Chinese on both sides continued to bomb each other on a daily basis, albeit with shells filled with propaganda instead of gunpowder. The communists, on odd days. The Nationalists, on even days.\nIn recent weeks, it has returned to the limelight, due to alleged U.S. plans to remilitarize the archipelago, considered for decades as \"the grenade in the tiger's mouth\". Although its seizure by force would be a piece of cake for the People's Liberation Army, Beijing's policy is that it will be reincorporated into the \"motherland\" at the same created_at as Taiwan and the other archipelagos.\nTaipei even controls an atoll in the South China Sea, in addition to Taiping, the largest of the islets in the disputed Spratley Islands.  The Republic of China was, in fact, the first to lay claim to almost the entire South China Sea, drawing, with eleven marks, the so-called \"cow's tongue\", later taken up, in a somewhat less excessive way, by the People's Republic of China. \n"

    "text": "\nAt least five U.S. aircraft carriers are set to be deployed in the western Pacific this year.\nThe display of naval power, accounting for nearly half of the country's 11 nuclear-powered supercarriers, is a clear reminder to Beijing, which is rapidly expanding its own military footprint, that it is not alone.\nThe Nimitz-class carriers, each nearly 1,100 feet long and capable of carrying around 90 aircraft, are also a signal to allies of Washington's resolve to step up its presence in a region. Hot spots in the East and South China seas, as well as Taiwan, have the potential to spark a wider conflict.\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln was seen sailing from her home port of San Diego as early as February 5, U.S. Naval Institute News cited ship trackers as saying.\nThe Carl Vinson and Theodore Roosevelt are already operating in the region—the former in the vicinity of Hawaii and the latter fresh from a port call in Guam on February 6.\nBoth ships participated in four days of joint exercises with Japanese warships in the Philippine Sea late last month. Images showed a Chinese warship keeping tabs on the drills not far away.\nMeanwhile, the only forward-deployed American supercarrier, the Ronald Reagan, is at dock in Yokosuka, Japan. The vessel returned in November from half a year of patrols and is slated to leave in the coming months for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, for maintenance.\nThe Ronald Reagan's place at the heart of the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet will be filled by the George Washington, bringing the carrier count to five.\nNewsweek reached out for comment to the U.S. 7th Fleet and the Chinese Foreign Ministry via emailed written requests.\nThe presence of so many flattops coincides with China's yearslong territorial disputes with U.S. partners like Japan and the Philippines along the so-calledfirst island chain.\nChina continues to pressure Taiwan with frequent warplane sorties near the midline of the narrow Taiwan Strait. Beijing has also been strategically deploying warships around Taiwan, which it has vowed to someday annex—by force if necessary.\nChinese coast guard ships intercept Philippine ships and attempt to block them from contested features in the South China Sea.\nThe China Coast Guard also continues its regular patrols near the Beijing-claimed but Tokyo-controlled Senkaku Islands.\nU.S. officials have said an attack on Japanese or Philippine assets in either of these contentious areas would trigger American military involvement, according to Washington's security commitments to the allies.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nUSS Carl Vinson Transits Pacific\nAircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) transits the Pacific Ocean. Carl Vinson and its embarked air wing, Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 17, are in the 3rd Fleet area of operations returning to homeport after a Middle East and Western Pacific Deployment.

    "text": "\nPetronas' latest venture in the realm of floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) in Malaysia will see the incorporation of cutting-edge technology from the Gutch maricreated_at equipment manufacturer, Straatman.  \nA long-created_at giant in dredging and bow-coupling, Straatman has clinched a contract to supply a critical ship-to-shore link system at the FLNG site.  \nThis system, known as SafeCom, will serve as a primary communication conduit for what is now the third Petronas FLNG project in the region. The facility will be situated offshore Sabah, east of Peninsular Malaysia, in waters close to the island of Borneo.  \nLNG carriers are a common site navigating the waters around the island, with both Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta having extensive LNG interests in the region; large-scale European interest in the region is also seen in the form of Italian firm Eni's presence in the waters off Kalimantan on the east and south-east coast of Borneo.  \nAt the Petronas run site, a collaboration with Korea's Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) is now in place. With SHI serving as the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) contractor for the project, Straatman's SafeCom system is being touted as offering both flexibility and adaptability to suit the specific needs of its international customer base.  \nThe system is said to be particularly effective during periods of intense stress when mooring activities are underway at oil and gas terminals.  \nHighlighting the significance of their involvement, officials from Straatman have emphasised their efforts to deliver state-of-the-art technologies to enhance both efficiency and safety in such maricreated_at operations.  \nAs hostilities in Ukraine drag on and with more and more countries in Asia seeing LNG as a crucial stepping stone in the move away from coal as they await more renewables infrastructure, countries in the region offering LNG exports are drawing attention.  \nIn just the past year, Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand have all taken steps to implement increased LNG use. Hanoi and Manila in particular have highlighted the use of the super-chilled fuel as being crucial in developing existing energy infrastructure for a combined population of 220mn straddling the South China Sea.  \nBut with the LNG market still showing signs of potential turbulence as a result of attacks on vessels by Houthi rebels in and around the Red Sea area, tensions are running high in Southeast Asia.  \nThis is serving to shine a light on local efforts to improve LNG infrastructure in the Southeast Asia region.  \nThe location at which the Straatman's SafeCom system is deployed is now Petronas' third FLNG endeavour. Referred to as ZFLNG, the project marks a major milestone for the Malaysian energy giant, as it not only represents the company's latest foray into FLNG projects but also stands as its maiden nearshore FLNG facility project in Malaysian waters.  \nEarlier in 2023 a consortium comprising Japan's JGC Corp. with its local Indonesian subsidiary and SHI was tasked with spearheading the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) aspects of the project.  \nOnshore facilities, and project management will also be controlled by JGC.  \nMeanwhile, SHI will handle all aspects of the actual floating LNG hull EPC work and the modular fabrication of the topside at the project site.  \nTo complement the project's extensive technological requirements to this end, energy-tech company Baker Hughes is also set to deliver a pair of LM9000-driven compressor trains.  \nAnd, with a targeted production capacity of at least 2mn tonnes per year (tpy) of LNG when operating at full capacity, the facility is now slated for completion by 2027. \n"

    "text": "\nBarbie has a new team of powerhouse lobbyists.\nMattel, the maker of Barbie, Hot Wheels and other iconic toys, hired a new lobbying firm this week, marking its return to the Washington influence game after more than 3 years.\nThe toy giant hired Mehlman Consulting, led by Bruce Mehlman, former assistant secretary of commerce for technology policy under President George W. Bush, to lobby on manufacturing and trade issues.\nMore specifically, the firm will lobby on “U.S. trade policy, U.S.-China policy, and supply chain policy,” according to the new federal lobbying registration.\nThe new hire comes on the heels of the record-smashing “Barbie” movie, which starred Margot Robbie as Mattel’s iconic Barbie doll, blew past box office benchmarks last summer and was a huge boon for the Mattel brand.\nMattel’s North American net sales topped $3 billion in 2023, up 1 percent from the previous year, according to the company’s year-end earnings report. North American global billings for Barbie, the company’s top “power brand,” were up 8 percent to $840.4 million in 2023 from $776.3 million in 2022. \nDuring the fourth quarter, which includes the busy holiday season, Barbie billings were up a whopping 43 percent from the same period in 2022, and the company’s net sales were up 32 percent, according to the report.\n“2023 was a milestone year for Mattel. We extended our leadership in our key toy categories and gained significant share overall, achieved extraordinary success with the Barbie movie, and further strengthened our financial position,” Ynon Kreiz, chairman and CEO of Mattel, said during the company’s year-end earnings call.\nBut not everyone loved everything about the Barbie movie. Some Republican lawmakers criticized the film for a scene featuring a map that critics say depicted parts of the South China Sea claimed by Vietnam as Chinese territory. Vietnam banned the movie for the depiction.\nWarner Bros. Film Group dismissed the “child-like crayon drawing” in “Barbie Land,” saying it “was not intended to make any type of statement,” in a statement to Variety.\nDetails in the new lobbying disclosure around Mattel’s lobbying on policies related to trade and the U.S.-China relationship are vague. Neither Mehlman nor Mattel returned requests for comment from The Hill.\nThe new Mattel account, however, is stacked with former officials and Capitol Hill alums.\nIn addition to Mehlman himself, the team includes Alex Perkins, who was previously trade counsel to the House Ways and Means Committee and counsel to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.); Sage Eastman, former senior counselor to the Ways and Means Committee; David Thomas, former deputy director of legislative affairs for Vice President Al Gore and director of congressional relations at the Federal Trade Commission; and Elise Pickering, former executive director for the House Republican Policy Committee.\nMichael Robinson, Constantine Hingson, Helen Tolar, Nichole Distefano, Paul Thornell and Stephen Cote are also on the account.\nThe last created_at Mattel hired a federal lobbying firm was in June 2021 as it prepared for a hearing before the House Oversight Committee on infant deaths linked to its Fisher-Price “Rock ‘n Play.” Mattel recalled millions of the popular reclining baby sleeper, but got a tongue lashing from members.\nThe lobbyist who helped prepare Mattel for the hearing and educate members was former Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle (R-N.Y.), who was also previously a commissioner at the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, according to the registration by Williams and Jensen.\nThe company terminated its agreement with the firm after the hearing, and no other internal or external lobbyists have registered on behalf of Mattel since, according to The Hill’s analysis of federal lobbying disclosures.\nBefore 2021, no federal lobbyists had registered on behalf of Mattel since 2009. \nThe brand has also never launched a Lobbyist Barbie, according to this comprehensive Buzzfeed list.\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.\n"

    "text": "\nFeb. 15—MANILA( Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN) — That word may best describe the state of mind of China when it criticized the plan of Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro Jr. to beef up military presence in Batanes, the country's northernmost province facing Taiwan.\nTeodoro bared that plan after his recent visit to the troops stationed in Batanes, including the naval detachment in the adjoining Mavulis Island.\nIn standard knee-jerk reaction to anything that may be said about Taiwan that does not conform to China's treatment of that island-nation, its foreign ministry spokesperson said Taiwan is \"at the heart of China's core interests and is a red line and bottom line that must not be crossed.\"\nHowever, he did not say how that plan would adversely affect China's repeated declarations of sovereign authority over Taiwan and its intention to use force, if necessary, to assert that.\nHis statement drew a strong rebuke from the Department of National Defense (DND) that China has no business warning the Philippines about its military plans within its territory.\nArrogant statement\nThe DND further said that it is its mandate \"to secure the sovereignty of the State and integrity of the national territory as enshrined in the Philippine Constitution ...,\" adding that \"China should refrain from engaging in provocative rhetoric and activities if it truly wants to earn the widespread trust and respect that it is trying so hard to gain but has, so far, been unable to.\"\nJay Batongbacal, head of the Institute of Maricreated_at Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the University of the Philippines, expressed his support for Teodoro's plan as the improved outposts would help secure the country's fishing grounds and the fishermen operating in the Batanes area.\nWhoever was behind or crafted China's arrogant statement must have labored under the impression that the Philippines is still being led by its fair-haired boy, former president Rodrigo Duterte.\nRecall that during the Duterte administration, in consideration for promises of billions of pesos of grants and loans for infrastructure projects, Duterte practically worshiped at the foot of China's leader, Xi Jinping.\nProvince of China\nDuterte turned a blind eye on China's brazen intrusion into the Philippines' exclusive economic zone in spite of an international arbitral ruling that upheld its rights over it, which he publicly described as a mere piece of paper that should be ignored.\nWorse, in a forum where local and international reporters were in attendance, he disgracefully suggested that the Philippines should be made a province of China!\nAs things turned out later, except for three projects, the promised massive financial assistance turned out to be all air. Duterte was ignominiously taken for a ride by China.\nThat subservient stance must have encouraged China into treating the Philippines as its docile ward and therefore gave it the \"right\" to poke its fingers in the latter's internal affairs.\nAnd so China had no qualms about taking issue with the DND's plan to strengthen the military presence in Batanes, which is a purely domestic matter, that would hardly make any difference to whatever designs it has over Taiwan.\nExercise of sovereignty\nIn other words, China saw ghosts where there are none.\nNote that on the occasions that the United States and some European countries rapped China for the militarization of islands and atolls in the West Philippine Sea (or in the South China Sea), China would cry foul about foreign interference in its domestic or internal affairs.\nIn China's book, it's hands-off by other countries on anything that involves matters within its territory, or what it considers as part of it by some dubious historical basis, but it is perfectly alright to intrude into those of another country, like the Philippines.\nStrengthening the military infrastructure in Batanes is an exercise of sovereignty.\nA new sheriff\nNo country, no matter how economically or militarily powerful it may be, has the right to question, much less cast aspersions on the motives behind that action.\nIf China thinks its latest bullying act would intimidate the Philippines into returning to its ways during the Duterte administration or ditch the Philippines' military partnership with US and other Western countries to keep the sea lanes in this part of the world freely navigable, it's flat wrong.\n___ (c)2024 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

    "text": "\nPresidents of Belarus and Russia Alexander Lukashenko and Vladimir Putin took part in a meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State. The event was held at the Konstantinovsky Palace.\nThe Belarusian head of state spoke about the serious joint work carried out with his Russian counterpart in recent days.\n\"We have really worked very hard these two days. We can put it bluntly: from the South Pole to the North Pole. We also discussed the problems of Antarctica - more comfortable conditions are being created there for the work of Russians, a wintering complex has been created. But the most important thing is that no one divides anything there. Belarusians work together with Russians. Our station is nearby. And all kinds of assistance, both scientific and in everyday life, are provided to the Belarusian specialists who are stationed there,\" the head of state said.\nAlexander Lukashenko continued: \"Then Vladimir Vladimirovich and I went from the south to the north. We analysed the events that are taking place in the world. Take our aspirations - Russia and Belarus, the People's Republic of China... Russia is at the forefront of this, because it bears the burden the most. And he suffers more than anyone.\"\nThe President stressed that the advent of a multipolar world and the reluctance of the current monopolist to give up its positions lead to conflicts in different parts of the world map. \"And the Houthis, and the Middle East, and the South China Sea, the problems with Taiwan - it's all because a multipolar world is coming. As the Russian Foreign Minister said, the monopolist does not want this. So they are trying to maintain a unipolar world by various methods. They have come to armed conflicts,\" Alexander Lukashenko said.\nAccording to him, at the talks with Vladimir Putin, issues of economic cooperation, including with the countries of Asia and Africa, were also discussed: \"We also discussed work on the Asian continent, especially in Africa, where we are invited. They are really waiting for us there. First of all, the Russian Federation with great opportunities.\"\nAlexander Lukashenko also noted the work on the development of cargo transportation along the Northern Sea Route. \"We would very much like this program to be implemented faster. It would be easier for us to work,\" he stressed.\n\"As you can see, there is a whole range of issues from south to north,\" the President summed up.\nAlexander Lukashenko outlined the main tasks and directions for the development of cooperation in the Union State both in the current period and in the future.\nThe head of state said that by the end of 2023, the parties will update the historical maximum of trade in goods and services. \"Vladimir Vladimirovich mentioned a figure of more than $40 billion in 10 months, but if we take the year as a whole (goods and services), it will be approximately $54 billion. This is indeed an all-created_at high. The achievement of high indicators is largely the result of the implementation of the activities of 28 union programs, within the framework of which fundamental decisions were made. But we still have to develop common criteria for assessing the effectiveness of their implementation,\" the President said.\nThe key at the current meeting of the Supreme State Council are the reports of the governments on the implementation of the main directions for the implementation of the provisions of the Treaty on the Establishment of the Union State for 2021-2023. The agenda also includes the approval of a new program document for the next three-year cycle - for 2024-2026. It involves continuing work to strengthen the common economic space and remove the remaining obstacles to trade.\nAccording to Alexander Lukashenko, it is important to strengthen the international positioning of the union, as it is done in the EAEU.\nAs the main task in the industrial sector, the President outlined the intensification of cooperation in the field of import substitution. At the same created_at, a lot has already been done. \"A lot has been done here. We have understood many things that we did not understand two years ago. They couldn't bring us to our knees. On the contrary, we mobilized and did a lot. Basic intergovernmental agreements have been signed on the recognition of technological operations, on the development of microelectronic technologies, the design and production of electronic components, electronic engineering, and on a unified industrial policy. Yesterday, in the middle of the day, Vladimir Vladimirovich and I carefully analyzed these issues using the example of microelectronics,\" Alexander Lukashenko said.\n"

    "text": "\nFeb. 15—KUALA LUMPUR( The Star/ANN) — Australia is committed to being a strategic partner of Asean, with an emphasis on stronger and practical collaboration in enhancing connectivity and resilience, says its Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong.\nExpressing confidence that it would be \"ultimately a matter of Asean\" as the bloc considers Australia's bid to join it, she said her nation is dedicated to Asean centrality.\n\"For us, Asean centrality goes beyond mere words. It reflects our geographical strategic reality.\n\"When Australia looks out to the world, the first thing we see is the countries of Asean. This notion is not just an abstract concept for us.\n\"We genuinely want to collaborate with Asean and its member countries to shape the kind of region we want to inhabit,\" she said in an interview with a group of South-East Asian journalists during the Asean-Australia Special Summit International Media Visit to Australia on Feb 7.\nDuring the nine-day programme, journalists from Malaysia, Brunei, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines and Timor-Leste met Australian officials, academics and leaders.\nWong said in her first year in government, one of the key priorities was to establish strong relationships in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"I made it clear that visiting every Asean country and every member of the Pacific Island Forum, except Myanmar for obvious reasons, was a top priority for us ... and we did that.\"\nAmid ongoing geopolitical strategic contests, she said Australia prioritises stating what it stands for.\n\"We want a region where all countries' sovereignty is respected, meaning that each nation can make independent choices.\n\"We want a region guided by rules and principles in resolving disputes, ensuring that outcomes are not solely determined by power and size.\n\"Timor-Leste understands this perspective and we want a more prosperous region. Prosperity benefits not only the people within Asean but also Australia.\n\"It brings economic advantages, (thus) enhancing our security and stability.\n\"That's why we place a big focus on economic development and (implementing) economic strategy,\" she added.\nAustralia will host the Asean-Australia Special Summit from March 4-6 in Melbourne, marking the 50th anniversary since the country became Asean's first dialogue partner in 1974.\nMultilateral relations then received a boost when a comprehensive strategic partnership was formed between Asean and Australia in October 2021.\nThis is Australia's second created_at hosting leaders of Asean member countries, with Timor-Leste's leader joining the summit for the first created_at.\n\"We're excited about the Special Summit in Melbourne,\" said Wong.\n\"When we came to government and we looked at the 50 years, one of the things we wanted to do was to make sure we had an appropriate and leader-level event to celebrate 50 years.\n\"(An event for us) to look ahead to the next 50, and to look ahead to our partnership for the future.\n\"That is the focus of the summit,\" she added.\nAsked if the Australian government would seek Asean membership, she said the decision at hand ultimately lies with Asean.\n\"We want to be the most effective dialogue and comprehensive strategic partner that we can be.\n\"When we established our office at the headquarters, I emphasised that while Australia may not be a superpower or the largest player in the region, we strive to be practical in our approach.\n\"We have the willingness to ensure real and practical outcomes to this partnership with Asean countries,\" said Wong.\nShe added that the comprehensive strategic partnership with Asean is \"progressing well\" and \"good things are happening\".\n\"We want to make that as effective and as practically positive for the countries of Asean as we can.\"\nWhen asked about Australia's role in ensuring peace, safety, stability and also access in the South China Sea amid tensions in the past year, Wong said Australia has a longstanding history of advocating for and supporting international rules and norms.\n\"We cannot rely on sheer size or influence to have our way in global affairs.\n\"We firmly believe that disputes should not be resolved solely based on power or economic strength.\n\"Therefore, we place great importance on upholding rules and norms.\"\nCiting Australia's stance in support of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), Wong said the principles should be prioritised.\n\"We understand that illegal fishing, unregulated fishing and access to fishing stocks are not just (border) security concerns but also food security matters.\n\"We all have the responsibility to ensure fair practices in these areas,\" she said.\nShe also congratulated Laos on its chairmanship and setting the theme of the upcoming 44th Special Summit, Enhancing Connectivity and Resilience.\n\"Connectivity and resilience hold significant relevance in the world we inhabit today.\n\"They encompass various aspects that contribute to the stability and prosperity of the region.\"\n___ (c)2024 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

    "text": "\nJunie Park '25, Robert Gates '65, L.H.D. '98 and Professor Michael Tierney '87. PEERAWUT RUANGSAWASDI / THE FLAT HAT\nThursday, Feb. 8, the College of William and Mary's Alexander Hamilton Society chapter hosted \"Gates: American Grand Strategy,\" a discussion with College Chancellor Robert M. Gates '65, L.H.D. '98 and George and Mary Hylton Professor of International Relations and Director of the Global Research Institute Michael Tierney '87.\nTierney began the discussion expressing appreciation toward AHS and Gates for their dedication in the event.\n\"I've been here for 28 years as a faculty member, and I was a student here a long created_at ago. And there have been no chancellors that show up, engage students in the same way that Chancellor Gates has, so I appreciate that,\" Tierney said.\nIn the discussion, Gates remarked that China, while wanting to retain the benefits of the current world order, also desires to establish a new one.\n\"I think China seeks a world in which they are dominant in Asia,\" Gates said. \"They have pushed the U.S. out of the western Pacific, and they are the leading global power. It is a world that allows them to take over Taiwan and to assert their sovereignty over the Nine-dash line and the South China Sea, which basically takes territories that belong to the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and others, for exploitation, fishing, mining, etc.\"\nGates expanded on the idea, asserting that China wants to showcase its dominance through military and economic strength.\n\"It is a world in which nations mind their own business and don't ask awkward questions about internal affairs of other countries,\" Gates said. \"It is a world in which might makes right. And it is a world that is open for Chinese economic expansion and growth.\"\nReferring to Gates's article in Foreign Affairs magazine, Tierney asked Gates about his thoughts on who is to blame for the United States' domestic dysfunction that is leading to an unstable world order.\n\"I think the problem on the Hill now is not bad leadership, but weak leadership,\" Gates said. \"None of the leaders in Congress have the power to make something happen. And this is a result of changes that have taken place in the Congress over the last number of years.\"\nGates pointed to reforms in Congress as the culprit, like the election of committee chairs and the abolition of earmarks, which have weakened the power of congressional leaderships.\nOne of the problems of Congress post-Watergate, he remarked, is ironically its democratization.\n\"And the irony of all these reforms is that over the decades, they have shifted more and more and more power to the executive branch because the Congress cannot act,\" Gates said. \"I'll just give you one example of a sore spot for me, for obvious reasons. The Department of Defense has not had an enacted appropriations bill at the beginning of the fiscal year, 1st of October in 14 years. That's a complete breakdown of the appropriations process, and it has a catastrophic effect.\"\nTierney and Gates also discussed the protest which interrupted a panel he participated in during December 2023. \n\"So, as director of Central Intelligence and Secretary of Defense, it was not exactly my first protest,\" Gates said. \"I would say that [the] protest that took place in December was probably the most polite and orderly I have ever seen. And what I had thought - one of the things that I thought was great about it actually, was they made their point and then followed the rules and then moved on when they were asked to, so that the rest of the audience could experience the program. So they didn't infringe on anytext else's rights, but they had the opportunity to make their point and then moved on. And it seems to me that's kind of the essence of what protests ought to be, at least on university campuses.\"\n\"I would say that [the] protest that took place in December was probably the most polite and orderly I have ever seen.\"\nAttendee Aileen Weber, a local Williamsburg resident, remarked that students were fortunate to have Gates as chancellor. She also inquired at the event about the current role of the United Nations. Gates explained the UN still serves a purpose, though it works best when the interests of the five nations who are permanent members of the Security Council are aligned.\n\"I think that U.S. leaders need to have a realistic appreciation of what the UN can do,\" Gates said. \"And the UN may potentially have some role in the Middle East, because frankly, I think, the five permanent members of the Security Council, figuring out some way to calm down the Middle East, may be a shared interest at some point.\"\nAHS President Junie Park '25 reflected on the event in an email to The Flat Hat.\n\"I think the event went spectacularly well!\" Park wrote. \"Turnout was unprecedented. Our RSVP form surpassed the number of seats the day before the event, with over 160 RSVPing for our event. We could not possibly count how many actually came to the event, but a very very rough estimate seems to be well over 200 people attempting to come to the event. A large number of people had to be unfortunately turned away because the room just simply couldn't hold any more people, but I'm confident they won't be that disappointed in missing out, as we will have many more events coming up this semester.\"\nThe next AHS featured speaker will be Center for Strategic and International Studies Daniel F. Runde, which will focus on American soft power and international aid. The event will take place Tuesday, Feb. 20 in Blow Memorial Hall.\n"

    "text": "\nPeople have laid down their lives for love, freedom, justice, the fatherland and more. But notext has ever died clutching the banner of the Rules-Based International Order. Itï¿½ï¿½s created_at to junk that cliche, and replace it with something more fitting.Thatï¿½ï¿½s not only because the term is an Orwellian linguistic atrocity with all the emotive oomph of a Powerpoint slide. Itï¿½ï¿½s also a shibboleth that, when used by American diplomats in particular, makes US foreign policy look hypocritical, from the Middle East to Africa, Asia and beyond.As a catchphrase, the RBIO has in recent years replaced the older and slightly different (but also woolly) notion of a ï¿½ï¿½liberal international order.ï¿½ï¿½ It surged once the administration of President Joe Biden took over, intent on signaling a return to a more principled foreign policy than that of Donald Trump. \nBiden and his diplomats talk up the rules-based international order so much that Stephen Walt at the Harvard Kennedy School, a scholar in the hard-nosed ï¿½ï¿½realistï¿½ï¿½ tradition, has mocked the turn of phrase as a ï¿½ï¿½job requirement.ï¿½ï¿½The world is skeptical about this American shtick, especially in Africa, Asia and South America, where countries are feeling pressure by Washington to align with the West against Russia and China. Beijing and Moscow, meanwhile, have an easy created_at skewering Americaï¿½ï¿½s double standards. Russian President Vladimir Putin tells audiences in the Global South that the RBIO is just a veneer for American exceptionalism, so that the US can arbitrarily make the ï¿½ï¿½rulesï¿½ï¿½ it wants and then ï¿½ï¿½orderï¿½ï¿½ everytext else around.Thatï¿½ï¿½s rich, of course, coming from the man who invaded the sovereign nation of Ukraine and ordered the slaughter of its civilians and the abduction of thousands of its children, prompting the International Criminal Court in The Hague to issue an arrest warrant to have him tried for war crimes. And yet the accusation of American hypocrisy resonates in many capitals.Washington all too often invokes the RBIO only against foes, such as Russia, while exempting itself and its friends, notably Israel. At the International Court of Justice in The Hague, South Africa has brought a case accusing Israel of genocide in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The judges have deemed the charges plausible enough to issue the equivalent of an injunction while they reach their verdict.The Biden White House, by contrast, sees no need to await the judgment of a tribunal that, one would think, embodies the RBIO as much as any institution on earth. South Africaï¿½ï¿½s case is ï¿½ï¿½meritless, counterproductive, and completely without any basis in fact whatsoever,ï¿½ï¿½ said a spokesman for the presidentï¿½ï¿½s National Security Council.This points to the underlying problem. John Dugard, a South African professor at Leiden University in the Netherlands and a former judge on the ICJ, argues that the US pushes its RBIO so hard precisely because it wants to avoid unreservedly endorsing, and obeying, an older, simpler and clearer idea: that of international law.That standard, which is universal rather than subjective like the RBIO, would be awkward for Washington. International law is based in part on multilateral treaties, many of which the US helped write. And yet America refuses to sign on to quite a number of them, including the Conventions on Cluster Munitions, on the Rights of the Child and on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as well as the 1977 Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, the Rome Statute that created the ICC, and more.So Washington canï¿½ï¿½t exactly make a legal case when scolding China, say, for bullying the Philippines in the South China Sea, since the US isnï¿½ï¿½t itself a signatory to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. It canï¿½ï¿½t credibly join the ICC in accusing Putin of war crimes because it doesnï¿½ï¿½t recognize that court -- and in fact sanctioned the ICCï¿½ï¿½s prosecutors when they looked into allegations of crimes by American soldiers in Afghanistan.Thatï¿½ï¿½s why the Biden administration prefers the RBIO to international law, Dugard thinks. The RBIO doesnï¿½ï¿½t actually define rules as lawyers would. It has no tribunals or procedures for dispute settlement. Nor does it care whether countries opt in or out. Instead, the rules-based international order is malleable enough to hint at the existence of standards while allowing the US to assert its own national interests.Defining national interests is a legitimate goal of foreign policy, and the US shouldnï¿½ï¿½t feel shy about using its prodigious (if declining) might to pursue them. Thatï¿½ï¿½s called realism in international relations. But as the tragedies of the previous centuryï¿½ï¿½s world wars and holocausts showed, it also behooves nations to temper power with norms and law. Thatï¿½ï¿½s called idealism. In the past eight decades, the US has been at its best whenever it spliced these two strands in its foreign policy, for its own good and that of the world.My advice to Biden and other Western leaders is to send out a staff memo: Drop the rules-based international order in all speechifying, and instead pledge fealty to international law. Then hold Russia, China and Iran accountable to that standard -- but also Israel and, yes, even the US when necessary.This shift wonï¿½ï¿½t always be convenient for Washington, but it will improve its relations with the world, which will be better off as a result -- more prosperous, free and peaceful. Compared to that yucky-sounding rules-based international order, the new pitch could also have a catchier and more authentic ring. After all, what could be more American than law and order?

    "text": "\nSoutheast Asian air forces are gradually recapitalising their tactical transport capabilities, amid a growing requirement to move personnel and equipment across broad geographies.\nThe early 2020s have been pivotal for the future of tactical airlift among Southeast Asian countries, with air forces that have long relied on ageing Lockheed Martin C-130s taking steps to obtain new equipment.\nSource: Greg Waldron/FlightGlobalA Royal Malaysian Air Force A400M at Malaysia’s LIMA show in May 2023. Kuala Lumpur received four A400Ms in 2015-2017\nThe requirement for new tactical transports is real. Cirium fleets data indicates that Southeast Asian air forces have over 90 aircraft serving in the fixed-wing, utility transport mission. The average age of this fleet is 30.1 years.\nLegacy C-130s dominate the region’s tactical transport space, with 60 examples in service. The average age of this fleet is 41.7 years.\nThe region’s two oldest C-130s are operated by the country considered to have Southeast Asia’s most modern air force: Singapore. The Republic of Singapore Air Force has one KC-130B that is 64.4 years old and a slightly younger sibling at 63.7 years.\nThe second most prominent transport in the region is the Airbus Defence & Space C295. The region’s air forces operate 21 examples, with an average age of 7.5 years.\nIndonesia was among the first regional air forces to place major commitments for new transports.\nIn September 2021 the long-created_at C-130 operator ordered five new C-130Js during a visit by officials to the USA. Four examples have been delivered.\nShortly after the C-130J commitment, Jakarta disclosed a long-awaited order for two Airbus Defence & Space A400Ms, a transaction that was finalised in December 2022. The aircraft will be delivered from 2026.\n\"Menyambut Super Hercules Baru: Pesawat C-130J A-1344 akan Tiba Memperkuat TNI AU\" Pangkalan TNI AU Halim Perdanakusuma bersiap menyambut kedatangan satu unit Pesawat C-130J Super Hercules dengan tail number A-1344 pada 22 Januari 2024. Kehadiran pesawat ini menjadi penguatan… pic.twitter.com/d7wHyQDI3M— TNI Angkatan Udara (@_TNIAU) January 15, 2024\nIn addition to the new C-130Js, Indonesia operates a trio of C-130Bs with an average age of 63.1 years, with these aircraft set to be retired. It also has 11 C-130Hs, some of which formerly served with the Royal Australian Air Force, and a single KC-130B tanker.\nLocal MRO firm GMF AeroAsia is conducting a major modernisation programme for eight of the C-130Hs, which includes replacing the centre wingbox and other improvements. The work adds 20 years to the C-130H’s service life. \nIndonesia also operates nine C295s, two of which were produced locally by Indonesian Aerospace, also known as PTDI. Moreover, Jakarta has expressed interest in the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT).\nIn October 2023, the Philippines also moved to update its transport capabilities, with Manila greenlighting the acquisition of three new C-130Js. Deliveries will run from July 2026.\nThe new aircraft will significantly boost Manila’s lift capability. They join four elderly C-130s, the oldest of which is a B-model example that is 62.3 years old. The Philippine air force also operates six C295s.\nAnother big regional C-130 operator is Thailand, operating 12 C-130Hs with an average age of 36 years. The Royal Thai Air Force appears content to stick with the platform, with its fleet having undergone a modernisation programme locally with Thai Aviation Industries.\nThe Thai upgrades involve cockpit displays and other systems such as a traffic alert and collision avoidance system and ADS-B. The aircraft have also received structural improvements.\nSource: Royal Thai Air ForceRoyal Thai Air Force officials with an upgraded C-130H in September 2022\nMalaysia’s exact plans for its 12 C-130s – 10 C-130Hs and two KC-130Hs – are not clear, although it is understood that the fleet will operate well into the 2030s. The average age of the fleet is 38.3 years, which suggests that these aircraft will remain viable with upgrades. Moreover, local MRO firm Airod has extensive experience with Malaysia’s C-130 fleet and is all but certain to participate in any upgrade programme.\nMalaysia also moved early to bolster its airlift fleet, with four A400Ms delivered between 2015 and 2017. The large four-engined type is well suited to rapidly moving personnel and equipment across the South China Sea, which divides peninsular Malaysia from the country’s Sabah and Sarawak provinces on the island of Borneo.\nArguably the most intriguing opportunity for acquiring a new airlifter is Singapore, with four KC-30Bs, one KC-30H, and five C-130Hs. The average age of the 10-aircraft fleet is 50.7 years. While old, Singapore’s C-130s have been extensively updated with glass cockpits and new avionics.\nSource: Republic of Singapore Air ForceRepublic of Singapore Air Force C-130s. Singapore operates some of Southeast Asia’s oldest C-130s, suggesting replacement efforts at some point\nThis force is backed up by six A330 MRTTs, which can carry passengers and cargo in addition to their tanking duties.\nIn 2022, chief of air force Major-General Kelvin Khong had this to say about Singapore’s C-130s: “The C-130 transport aircraft is a valuable workhorse and we will continue to operate it for as long as it is operationally and economically feasible, whilst continuing to keep a look out for new capabilities that can better meet our future needs.”\nA clear path forward for Singapore is the C-130J, although the US government has not published a Foreign Military Sales case for Singapore regarding this platform. The C-130J would appeal to air force personnel who have long experience with the legacy C-130 and be in-line with neighbours and the city state’s major defence partner, the USA.\nAnother possibility for Singapore is the Embraer C-390, which is coming to the Singapore air show. The type has traction in Asia: late 2023 saw the twin-jet type emerge as the surprise winner of South Korea’s Large Transport Aircraft II acquisition for three aircraft. This marked the type’s first sale in Asia and was an important victory over the C-130J in a country that has long operated C-130s.\nSource: Embraer Defense & SecuritySouth Korea will field three C-390 transports via a contract with Embraer\nThe type’s payload and speed could be of utility to Singapore’s military given that it frequently trains in far-flung locations such as Australia, New Zealand, and the USA.\nThe last decade has seen significant progress in Southeast Asia’s tactical airlift front. As legacy C-130s continue to age, manufacturers such as Airbus, Embraer, and Lockheed will compete hard for emerging fleet replacement and growth opportunities.\n"

    "text": "\nNepal, Feb. 15 -- The rising geopolitical rivalry among the big powers has been the root cause of conflicts\nAlbert Einstein famously stated, \"I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.\"\nConflict and violence are on the rise with numerous conflicts waged between states and non-state actors such as political militias, criminal, and international terrorist groups. On a regional basis, there has been a decline in the major conflicts in North Africa and South Asia, while conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, Middle East and the Asia-Pacific are on the rise. On the basis of countries, violence increased significantly in Mali, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Israel, Palestine, Sudan and Ukraine; making the deadliest of armed conflicts since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\nThe rising geopolitical rivalry among the big powers has been the root cause of conflicts. Not only big powers but middle powers are also competing for influence in states or regions by supporting competing interests through the supply of troops and weapons. Unsettled regional issues, a deterioration in the rule of law, absence of state institutions, illegal economic gains, and the lack of resources exacerbated by climate change and supply disorders have become the dominant drivers of conflicts.\nAs a result of the autocratic and undemocratic regimes in a number of countries, ethnic, religious and state violence are on the rise. It is igniting and extending spaces for the foundation of terrorism, and almost all terrorist-related deaths occur in countries associated with a violent conflict or with high levels of political terror. A series of violent conflicts and terror attacks taking place in the Middle East, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa, with highest in Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Syria, are severe in nature with the heaviest burden.\nWith the rising US-China rivalry and the consequent shifts in regional influences, the environment of global geopolitics is boosting for serious transformations in upcoming decades. China's heightened activities in the South China Sea region signify its desire to project dominance and protect its territorial claims. After the end of the cold war, the United States has expanded its network of strategic military bases across various regions ranging from the Middle East to South-East Asia and Central America.\nFor a couple of years, the attention and resources of global powers are going to be concentrated on three hotspots in particular: the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Gaza conflict and tensions over Taiwan. These hotspots are so delicate that further escalation in any of them would radically disrupt global supply chains, financial markets, security dynamics and political stability by seriously threatening the sense of security and safety of individuals worldwide. Big world powers have their own vested interests in these areas which are situated at a geopolitical crossroads: oil and trade routes in the Middle East, stability and the balance of power in Eastern Europe, and advanced technological supply chains in East Asia.\nThese high-stakes hotspots undermine global security, and their ripple effects may fuel an explosive reaction, exacerbating both new and existing animosities. For example, spillover impacts from a high concentration of conflicts, such as in Asia and Africa, could range from more readily available arms trafficking to conflict-driven migration. Frozen conflicts at risk could include the Balkans, Libya, Syria, Kashmir, Guyana, the Kurdish region and the Korean peninsula, where active armed conflict has been brought to an end, but no peace treaty or other political framework resolves the conflict to the satisfaction of the combatants. The Himalayan region is poised to become a potential hotspot for regional conflicts, with several countries in the vicinity at risk of becoming victims of such hostilities. Moreover resource stress, economic hardship and weakened state capacity will likely grow and, in turn, it would fuel conflict. And with instant information networks and reinforcing algorithms, the symbolism of high-stakes hotspots could trigger contagion beyond conflict geographies.\nThe armed political violences have been so widespread that some modes of conflict can be witnessed as intrastate/civil conflict between a government and at least one non-governmental party within a sovereign country, interstate conflict between two or more governments, non-state conflict between two organized armed groups, neither of which is the government of a state, and one-sided violence by the use of armed force by the government of a state or by a formally organized group against civilians. Technological advances are contributing to the changing nature of conflict. There are concerns about the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to enhance cyber, physical, and biological attacks.\nThe fear of violence is negatively affecting peace and property of the general public from destruction of houses to collapsing warcreated_at economies while lost access to public services have forced many people to leave their home and migrate to safer places within conflict countries or abroad. Not only the ordinary victims but the rising conflicts and violences are also challenging to the systems of governance, national identities, international law and democratic values and it is contributing to civil unrest, threatening human rights, and reigniting violence, not only in advanced democracies but also between the Global North and the Global South. Moreover, the rising competition among the power mongers, both old and new in developing countries, combined with more recent price hikes of food and fuel and the hardships for livelihood could accelerate negative sencreated_atnts towards industrialized nations over a couple of years.\nRising centralization of power with declining mode of resources and tighter economic conditions and the military power projection of the West could be unacceptable which would create power vacuums in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. As per example, France has been compelled to withdraw its troops from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger over the past two years. As the dominance of long-held power centers are in declining trends, new powers will emerge as alternatives in interstate and intrastate conflicts, which would lead to dangerous long lasting proxy warfare and large expansion in humanitarian crises.\nThe causes behind such conflicts range from access to raw resources, such as minerals and oil, to the protection and promotion of trade, investment and security interests. The power blocks will support and supply resources to their political allies, taking advantage of this widening rift between the old and new powers. In this course of conflict, the position of unprincipled states will be isolated and more futile with clear divisions. Moreover, international governance and peacekeeping mechanisms that would be more ineffective at 'policing' conflict could be sidelined.\nAs the results of a speedy rise in the global conflicts and violences would be equally harmful for both the winners and losers of war the big powers have greater responsibilities to save the innocent people from the danger of war and they must play a leading role to bring a consensus to save the human life and property from destruction. In this concern, positive peace offers a roadmap to underscore the importance of building stronger institutions, fostering openness, and promoting mutual respect on the global stage. The slow but steady nature of positive peace indicates that global peace requires patience, long-term commitment, and consistent efforts. Through international collaboration rooted in these principles, we can envision a world that not only survives challenges but thrives amidst them.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Republica.

    "title": "House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Hearing; \"Examining Federal Science Agency Actions to Secure the U.S. Science and Technology Enterprise.\"; Testimony by Arati Prabhakar, Director, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy",
    "created_at": "2024-02-15",
    "text": "\nI would like to thank Chairman Lucas, Ranking Member Lofgren, and the members of this committee for the invitation to address the subject of research security.\nBefore my current role as the President's science and technology (SandT) advisor and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), I spent half my professional life in public service, including as Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The other half of my career has been in the private sector, in a couple of companies and a decade in early-stage venture capital.\nWhen President Biden asked me to step into my current role, I immediately said \"yes\". I've been able to contribute to American innovation from so many different places, and I know that it takes the whole ecosystem--public and private--to do big things for our country. That is how we create the advances that change Americans' lives.\nOSTP is the one place that works with, looks across, and supports the entire SandT ecosystem. Our mission is to strengthen America's science, technology, and innovation, and to make sure the enterprise is aimed at our country's great aspirations. These include strengthening our economy, achieving robust health and opportunity for every person, meeting the climate crisis, and bolstering global peace and stability.\nToday, the global strategic environment is characterized by fierce military and economic competition among many actors. I will focus on the People's Republic of China (PRC), because it is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and the ability to harness significant military and economic power to advance that objective. This is evident in the PRC's actions ranging from its conduct in the South China Sea, to atrocities in Xinjiang, to its state-centric approach to product standards.\nTechnology and research and development (RandD) are central to this competition. I would like to put the PRC's efforts in perspective and then outline the actions of the Biden-Harris Administration.\nThe PRC's spending on RandD has grown from $14 billion in 1996 to $670 billion in 2021 in purchasing power parity, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This is an unprecedented surge, which puts the PRC into second place behind the United States' $800 billion in RandD expenditures in 2021. The PRC's spending is more than 40 percent greater than the entire European Union's RandD funding.\nThe PRC is pouring this funding into many fields and research facilities. Both diplomatic reporting and observations among U.S. researchers indicate how the PRC is seeking to become the focal point for many areas of RandD. These efforts include offers to host RandD activities and facilities, invitations to participate in PRC experiments, and diplomatic efforts to host major scientific meetings and conferences in critical and emerging technology areas.\nThe PRC's RandD and manufacturing priorities include its intent to be the world-leading developer in areas such as:\n* Artificial intelligence\n* Quantum information sciences\n* Semiconductors\n* New materials\n* Smart manufacturing and robotics\n* Brain science\n* Genetics and biotechnology\n* Deep space exploration\nYou will note many similarities if you compare their list to prior and current U.S. Critical and Emerging Technologies lists.\nEvery developing and developed economy pumps funding into RandD, pursues global partnerships, and seeks to trade in high-tech goods. What distinguishes the PRC is its use of illicit as well as licit means to acquire foreign technologies, its engagement in unfair competition in targeted industries, its mandatory strategy of military-civil fusion, and a general lack of transparency.\nTo face down this challenge, President Biden has taken unprecedented action.\nTo protect national security, this Administration has levied record fines for export control violations, established new export controls on semiconductors, and expanded controls on outbound investment from the U.S. in certain sensitive technologies and products. We are rebuilding America's lead in semiconductors with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. The Department of Justice has pursued numerous cases related to trade secret theft and economic espionage. These actions are oriented toward industry, the source of high-tech products and significant technology development.\nTo address risks to research security, the Administration is implementing National Security Presidential Memorandum 33 (NSPM-33) and provisions of the CHIPS and Science Act. Here, the purpose is to make sure that universities and other academic institutions understand the altered global landscape and fulfill their responsibilities as the first line of defense against illicit activity. Unlike proprietary RandD, most academic research is intended for publication and thrives in a global exchange of ideas. But some research can lie close to applications with national security implications. Access to data can lead to unauthorized transfer and use. The PRC has funded hidden parallel labs to replicate research. And as the PRC learns to conduct better and better leading-edge research, it is unfortunately the case that it will use some of that work to America's detriment.\nMembers of the academic research community are still catching up to the changes in geopolitics. Many of the things that researchers were encouraged to do only a decade ago, like help establish laboratories in the PRC, are now being discouraged. This is why we must be abundantly clear with the research community about the ways that the PRC and the Chinese Communist Party have changed; how the PRC's policies and practices differ from U.S. industrial and defense Randamp;D efforts; and the ways in which some research activities in the PRC take and exploit U.S. data or technologies to contribute to human rights abuses, the Ministry of State Security's surveillance apparatus, and military aggression. It is essential that we address these issues.\nThe accompanying increase in scrutiny of U.S. researchers' ties to the PRC has given rise to another essential issue. For many Asians and Asian Americans, research security efforts run the risk of exacerbating anti-Asian sencreated_atnt, which had already increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. That is why the Biden-Harris Administration has been clear that we cannot and will not pursue policies or processes that worsen xenophobia.\nIn addition, as captured in NSPM-33, \"the open and collaborative nature of the United States RandD enterprise underpins America's innovation, SandT leadership, economic competitiveness, and national security.\" It is crucial that we maintain that open and collaborative environment to compete effectively in the global race for science and technology.\nWe are implementing research security with these things in mind, along with our partners in the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the members of the National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Research Security. This includes the release of NSPM-33 implementation guidance in 2022, which consisted of multiple rounds of public consultation with outside stakeholders, research organizations, and members of the Asian-American community.\nLate last year, OMB finalized and the National Science Foundation posted common disclosure forms for use by all agencies as developed by the National Science and Technology Council and required by NSPM-33. This month, OSTP released guidance on the use of these common forms to provide additional clarity to researchers, research institutions, and agencies on how they can use the information disclosed in the forms to make informed decisions about research funding and performance. The forms also make clear that federally funded researchers cannot be members of malign foreign talent recruitment programs, as required by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. In addition, these forms help reduce the overall reporting burden for recipients of federal funds by having clear and consistent requirements across government agencies.\nWe are completing work on the research security programs requirement after receiving extensive public comments on a draft published in the Federal Register in March 2023. These requirements for research security programs at universities will provide clear standards on research security training, cybersecurity, export control training, and foreign travel security. It is vital that these programs be more than a checkbox--that they achieve increased awareness of research security threats and enable researchers and academic institutions to respond appropriately.\nAdditionally, we have released guidelines on foreign talent recruitment programs, as required by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. These guidelines intend to limit conflicts of interest with foreign governments for federally funded researchers, while not disrupting the United States' ability to engage in productive scientific exchanges that are in the national interest.\nIn all of these situations, it is our responsibility as the government to establish clear lines about what is and is not acceptable so that our scientists and engineers can focus on delivering the progress that will maintain America's leading position.\nThere is no question that the PRC is a formidable actor in technology and RandD, with rapid growth, funding, focused efforts, and efforts to systematically collect information that could give it a strategic advantage. American RandD is still strong, but we are no longer the sole big player on the world stage, and we can't rest on our laurels.\nThe bipartisan support of this committee has helped ensure the United States' strong position in RandD across decades. I want to thank you for that consistent dedication. It has shaped the lives of Americans in every part of our Nation, creating jobs, improving health, changing how we connect and live and work, and making every one of us safer and more secure. We must get today's RandD right so that science and technology can continue to help create a better future.\nThank you, and I will be happy to hear your thoughts and questions.\nRead this original document at: \n"

    "title": "Global Trade: Ruptured geopolitical order letting Red Sea turn 'Redder'!",
    "created_at": "2024-02-15",
    "text": "\nTIOL - COB( WEB) - 907 FEBRUARY 15, 2024\nBy Shailendra Kumar, Founder Editor\nIF global trade is the heart of globalisation or, one may call it, re-globalisation, the oceans are the 'throbbing heart' of global trade! Jarringly, the oceans are on the boil, imperilling the flow of global supply chain and threatening a fresh bout of much-dreaded disruption - second one after the pandemic! It all started with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Black Sea was mined and transformed into a no-go zone for merchant vessels shipping commodities from Ukraine. China's favourite pascreated_at is to act like an 'overweight' bully going berserk in the South China Sea and menacingly turning the ocean waters into a new theatre of geopolitical bloodbath. Tensions are ballooning even in the East China Sea where Taiwan reports more Chinese balloons over Taiwan Strait. Then comes the 'hair on fire' Red Sea which is under attack from the Yemen-based raggle-taggle militia group Houthis who are not listening to the global voice of sanity and are dangerously close to making the Red Sea 'redder'! Houthis are hell bent on twisting the 'lion's tail'! Not scared of 'gigawatt' military powers!\nAnd their provocation is the Israeli's pogrom in Gaza! Their resolve is to keep firing missiles on merchant vessels until the war in Gaza is paused. Although Houthis are not directly impacted by the Gaza war but they are trying to cash in on the solidarity slogan and the boiling blood in the Arab World. Keen to catapult their standing in the Muslim world and also to please their mentor and the key supplier of modern arms, drones and anti-ship missiles - Iran, Houthis are willing to go an extra mile to attack even American and the British destroyers and naval fleets. Ouch, the mythical giant slayer! They also share their Iranian moorings with Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon - a sinister axis of brotherhood! Since November 2023, they have launched close to two-dozen strikes with drones swarming over any commercial ship sailing through Bab al-Mandab, a narrow strait between Africa and the Arabian peninsula. By doing so, Houthis are piling pressure on the Western countries which are, in turn, expected to mount diplomatic pressure on Israel to halt the war. Though they initially wanted to target only Israel-owned ships or Israel-headed vessels but later, chose their targets on random basis and validated them as disruption raises diplomatic cortisol across the developed economies. On December 15th, they hit a Liberian-flagged vessel, Platinum III, with an anti-ship ballistic missile. On February 12, they launched a missile but it failed to hit the vessel, thanks to their unsophisticated weapons!\nRed sea is the lifeline for international trade between Asia and Europe through Suez Canal. About 13% of global trade by volume and about 31% of global container traffic pass through it. An immediate fall-out of the serial drone assaults coupled with a fusillade of missiles was suspension of the route by world's five largest container-shipping companies - Maersk, MSC, CMA, CGM and Hapag-Lloyd. They have re-routed their vessels through the African Cape of Good Hope which takes about 30 to 40 days extra to deliver goods in Europe. Sumptuously, shipping companies have thus far not borrowed the clothes of Shylock like the one they had done during the pandemic when rates had skyrocketed to USD 20,000 from USD 1500. But, if the Houthis-sparked fire is not quickly doused, none can guarantee that the shipping companies would not revise their rates in the near future. And that would further bruise the barely-recovered trade from Asia! To retaliate, the US has formed a multi-national military coalition with about 12 Western countries joining it and has ignited an operation called 'Operation Prosperity Guardian'. UK and France have joined the American naval assets and have jointly hit many coordinates believed to be the stockpiles of anti-ship missiles. Though a few retaliatory strikes have been executed by the American command centre but the White House is extra leery about not expanding the perimeter of the conflict which may spill over into regional war in the fragile Arab security paradigm. This was, in fact, the key reason for the US to ponder over three days before its bombers rained bombs on Iran-backed jihadists whose drone had killed three American soldiers in Iraq.\nThough Houthis drones are being neutered and air strikes have put them on defensive but the US has not deserted the diplomatic route to put pressure on Iran to dissuade its proxies from escalating war-like scenarios in the Middle East. To expedite its efforts, the US has been confabulating with Chinese diplomats as China happens to be the key importer of 90% of Iranian oil exports. Secondly, Iran is a close pal of China which has been expanding its anti-US club. True, Chinese influence can be used to stop the threat to a key artery of global trade and it is reported that China has sent a message to Tehran but China also sees the region's security as a quicksand of America's making and may like to play sympathy and solidarity paean with the Arab world. Beijing may not give a hoot to the deepening crisis with a silly grin but it should not forget that close to 17% of its exports to EU and Britain is routed through the Red Sea. Last fortnight reptilian Houthis announced that they would not attack Chinese and Russian ships but the fact is that Chinese exporters largely use ships hoisting flags of other countries and they are under repeated attacks. That is the reason that its Containerised Freight Index has almost doubled since December 2023 as most ships are now plying through Cape route. This is certainly a testy created_at for China which had produced a film called 'Operation Red Sea' in which Chinese navy had staked its might to save a Chinese citizen taken hostage by a terrorist group. This is indeed the iron-hot occasion for China to rise above its narrow differences with the US and join global forces in the larger interest of global trade! But, my hunch is - Mr Xi is unlikely to ping!\nWhat about New Delhi? Though the White House has invited all like-minded countries to join the military coalition but New Delhi has not joined it so far even though its oil buys from Russia has become expensive because of the Red Sea crisis. However, India has dispatched several naval assets to the east of Red Sea which is swarmed by African pirates. Piracy had, in the recent years, diminished but after the Houthis attack, many gangs have resurfaced to make hay while Houthis attacks escalate. To repulse and foil such attempts, India has deployed two frontline warships in the Gulf of Aden and 10 warships in the Arabian Sea besides surveillance aircraft. The Indian Navy warships have been escorting Western and non-Western ships through the piracy-plagued stretches and have also rescued Indian and non-Indian crew for many ships. Its command centre has been sharing vital intelligence with the Western countries which are concentrating on strategy to deter Houthis. Being a Quad member, its surveillance inputs are vital for the Coalition naval fleets deployed in the Red Sea.\nLet's now wing across the geopolitical corridors and find out what is happening to the brittle economies in the Arab World. Economic chaos is almost omnipresent in every economy. The leading economies like Saudi Arabia, UAE and others are also impacted by the present crisis as the route to Mediterranean from the Red Sea is the Suez Canal. Egypt is obviously the most horribly affected economy as Suez Canal revenue is critical for its forex kitty. In 2023, about 24000 ships had plied this passage - about 20% of the world's container traffic, 8% of LNG and 10% of seaborne oil. And Egypt had earned about USD 9.5 billion in revenue. Without the toll revenue, its Central Bank forex piggybank would run dry in less than two months. After the Houthis began their strikes, the traffic through Suez Canal has dwindled by 73% and its revenue is down by 40%. The Egyptian economy has already been in dire straits. Tourism accounts for 15% of its GDP but it has damagingly shrivelled after the Gaza invasion. Its economy has been breathing only because of the IMF bail-out package. Jordan is also enormously impacted as international arrivals have almost halved. The Gaza War has visibly derailed the prosperity dream of many economies in the region.\nBesides the Red Sea crisis, there are many other factors which have hurt the cause of global trade. Climate is one of them. Climate change has resulted in prolonged drought which means shallow water levels in important trade routes like Panama Canal which accounts for 5% of the global trade and provides a vital link between the Atlantic and the Pacific for ferrying goods to Latin American economies. Panama normally collects toll worth USD 2 billion but because of shallow water, the daily traffic (about 40 ships) is down to 16. Secondly, large ships cannot navigate through. Let's also not forget that oceans are vital conduits for over 550 submarine telecom cables across the world. We are today connected to the world through internet only because of these cables which if scythed or blown up like the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines, it would spell billion-dollar disasters for the world economy. The shadow of drones and lethal missiles appear to be lengthening if we go by the latest Israeli strike at the last thickly-populated geography of Gaza - Rafah as the tally of human casualty can hardly be contained! Splattering of blood and mounds of corpses would further trigger fury across the Arab World and it would irresistibly prompt Houthis and other Iranian proxies like Hezbollah to make the situation 'deliciously' complicated. The World Bank and IMF have already projected that the year 2024 is going to be Eeyorish for the recession-squeezed world economy. Against these projections, if polar night lies ahead for the global trade also, let's all brace up for pitcherful of bad created_ats ahead for humanity - more particularly the poor! Oh heck, another serious supply chain crunch in the offing! Another labyringth walk for the businesses! Sacr bleu!\n"

    "text": "\n 16 Feb 2024 (Radio Free Asia) Prabowo Subianto's foreign and defense policies have come under the spotlight after the former army general and current defense minister claimed victory in Indonesia's presidential election this week.\nPrabowo won almost 60% of the votes, according to several polling agencies drawing attention to his policies amid rising tensions in the South China Sea and China-United States rivalry.\nIndonesia is not a party to the South China Sea dispute but it has a strategic and economic interest in maintaining peace and stability there as its exclusive economic zone overlaps with several neighboring countries, as well as with the so-called nine-dash line that Beijing uses to claim China's historic rights over most of the sea.\nThe South China Sea dispute has become one of Indonesia's most important security issues and it could also spark a major conflict between the United States and China, according to Aristyo Rizka Darmawan, a senior researcher at the Center for Sustainable Ocean Policy at the University of Indonesia.\nPrabowo's campaign documents state that Indonesia needs to prepare for future conflicts and plan how to reduce potential risks.\n'Prabowo's narrative on the South China Sea has been more about how we [should] have a strong defense capacity,' Darmawan told BenarNews, a news service affiliated with Radio Free Asia.\nMuhammad Zulfikar Rakhmat, a researcher at the National University of Singapore (NUS), said that the former general 'has had a history of advocating for a more assertive and independent foreign policy for Indonesia.'\n'His victory in the election might lead to a recalibration of Indonesia's approach to the South China Sea issue and regional security,' Zulfikar told RFA. 'Prabowo may prioritize strengthening Indonesia's military capabilities in the disputed waters.'\nAristyo Rizka Darmawan said Prabowo would likely focus on building up the naval forces as a deterrent in the waters around the Natuna islands, where encroachments by Chinese fishing vessels and patrols have become regular.\n\"Defense and maricreated_at capabilities of the Indonesian navy are important. With such a strategy, Prabowo would most likely implement a more assertive policy in the North Natuna Sea,\" the senior researcher from the University of Indonesia said.\nStrategic continuity\nIndonesia is a founding member of ASEAN and under its chairmanship in 2023, the bloc and China embarked on a new round of draft agreement discussion for a Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea.\nHowever, Prabowo 'has not offered any new ideas for promoting dialogue or accelerating the COC negotiations,' Darmawan said.\n\"Relying solely on military capabilities would not help much in maintaining peace and security in the contested waters. To show leadership in ASEAN, Indonesia should not only think of itself but also think of a bigger role in helping the region avoid escalation and conflict,\" he added.\nThe new president will take a middle-of-the-road position on the South China Sea dispute without offering anything new, according to Muradi, a military analyst and professor of political and security studies at Padjadjaran University.\n'It is clear that his politics will be more focused on domestic affairs. This is the characteristic of a soldier who was born and raised in the Cold War era,\" Muradi, who goes by one name, said.\nThe analyst warned that the situation in the South China Sea is evolving and so is the threat from China to ASEAN. China's military modernization is expected to be completed by 2027 and many predict that by then Beijing would be confident enough to wage an open conflict in the region and the U.S. would have to intervene to support its allies.\n\"This requires more fundamental steps, not just saying we need this or that but concrete actions,' he said.\nZulfikar from the NUS, meanwhile, said Prabowo's stance on China and the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy may not be straightforward.\n'While he has expressed interest in cultivating closer ties with China, particularly in terms of economic cooperation, Prabowo has also emphasized the importance of maintaining Indonesia's sovereignty and independence in its foreign policy,' Zulfikar said.\nThat may see Prabowo 'seeking to enhance regional cooperation with ASEAN countries and other regional powers to address security challenges.'\n'Prabowo may adopt a pragmatic approach, seeking to balance Indonesia's relations with both China and the United States to maximize its own interests.'\n'Regarding the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy and AUKUS grouping [between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.], he may approach them cautiously, emphasizing Indonesia's non-alignment stance while exploring potential benefits and risks associated with increased engagement with these initiatives,' the NUS researcher added.\nHuong Le Thu, Asia deputy director at the International Crisis Group said that she doesn't 'expect major changes in foreign policy as Prabowo takes over, not in the early days, at least.'\nThe former general repeatedly promised to continue the domestic and foreign policies of his predecessor, the widely popular president Joko Widodo.\n'After all, 'continuity' was among the main aspects of his campaign,' she said, 'If anything, I would expect more of the old - and old old - than of the new.'\n"

According to news reporting from Guangzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"We report on the feeding ecology of two species, the short-headed lanternfish Diaphus brachycephalus and Warming's lanternfish Ceratoscopelus warmingii, using data collected over five surveys from 2015 to 2017 in the open South China Sea. D. brachycephalus feed mainly on copepods, with few differences in food composition between different-sized individuals; the diet of C. warmingii is more diverse, including crustacean zooplankton, gelatinous animals, and Mollusca, and differs significantly between fishes >55 mm in text length and smaller fishes. Interspecific competition for food between these two species is not strong, while intraspecific competition may be more intense in D. brachycephalus than in C. warmingii.\" \n The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, \"Trophic levels of D. brachycephalus (3.46) and C. warmingii (3.38) identify both species as third-trophic-level lower carnivores. The diel feeding patterns of D. brachycephalus and C. warmingii differ: the former feeds actively both day and night when food is plentiful, and feeds primarily in the upper layer at night and in the mesopelagic layer during the daycreated_at, and the latter ascends into the upper 100 m at night to feed, but stomach fullness is lower than D. brachycephalus.\" \n According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Dry-text-weight daily ration estimates for D. brachycephalus range from 5.19% to 16.46%, and those for C. warmingii range from 1.38% to 4.\" \n This research has been peer-reviewed. \n For more information on this research see: Feeding ecology of the short-headed lanternfish Diaphus brachycephalus and Warming's lanternfish Ceratoscopelus warmingii (Myctophidae) in the South China Sea.

    "text": "\nA UNITED States-based maricreated_at defense analyst said \"assertive transparency,\" the Philippines' new strategy for countering China's aggressive actions in the West Philippine Sea, is working.\n\"A bad actor can't hide in the shadows because the light has been turned on. (Assertive transparency) does help to disinfect the whole thing. It makes that bad actor responsible for their actions in a way that they are hoping to avoid,\" said Raymond Powell, a retired US Air Force colonel and founder and director of SeaLight, a maricreated_at transparency project that monitors and reports activities in the South China Sea, during a roundtable discussion with The Manila created_ats on Thursday.\nAssertive transparency involves the use of photographs and videos to expose and document illegal incursions and incidents of harassment and intimidation at sea.\nPowell said what the Philippines has done with this tactic in the past year is \"revolutionary.\"\nThe strategy helped bring to international attention the Feb. 6, 2023 incident at Ayungin Shoal in the West Philippine Sea, when a China Coast Guard (CCG) ship used a military-grade laser to drive away a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessel.\n\"The laser-pointing was incidental or reactive transparency: there was an incident that happened, and there were photos so they decided to release it. But what happened next was really unique,\" said Powell, who coined the term assertive transparency.\nAfter the said incident, the PCG began to document other incidents of Chinese harassment at Philippine outposts and vessels in the West Philippine Sea.\n\"They took pictures of the Chinese vessel swarm off Pag-asa Island, which has been in the area for a couple of weeks. What happened after the pictures were taken and released to the public was the vessels dispersed,\" Powell said.\n\"It was clear that Beijing did not like those pictures and they did not want any more of them. So the Philippines discovered something that it could use as leverage in the struggle,\" he said.\n\"The Philippines is obviously overmatched by the strength of the CCG and Chinese maricreated_at militia (CMM) ships, but what it did have was essentially a moral high ground,\" he said.\nPowell said conclusions can be drawn that assertive transparency has worked to achieve certain conditions for success.\nFirst, he said, it strengthened the Philippines' national resilience.\n\"Getting the Filipino people behind you so that you can take steps like building the country's maricreated_at security, and passing legislation so it is not easily exploited or pushed around,\" said Powell, who was the team leader of Project Myoushu from July 2022 to July 2023 under the Stanford's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation.\nThe project seeks to develop tools to counter Beijing's \"gray zone\" tactics in the South China Sea.\nSecond, the international support it generated gives the country the moral and material leverage against China.\nFinally, it imposes reputational costs against Beijing to force a change in its behavior based on risks.\nHe said the tactic provides the Philippines leverage in future negotiations \"because, in the end, Manila is not interested in fighting with China.\"\n\"I do think that China is looking at changing its tactics. The questions they could be asking now: Is it still in China's interest to be so overtly coercive? Maybe it sort of needs to adjust. But what it adjusts to remains to be seen,\" said Powell.\nHe said he sees assertive transparency as in the same spectrum of activities with the 2016 arbitral tribunal ruling that rejected Beijing's expansive claim over the South China Sea.\n\"None of these things by themselves wins. It is finding those things that give the Philippines a little bit more of an edge,\" Powell said.\n"

Armand Balilo later said the attempt to hack the PCG website could be related to disputes between Manila and Beijing over the West Philippine Sea, part of the country's exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea.\nSpeaker Martin Romualdez has already called for a congressional inquiry into the hacking attempts.\nRomualdez said that the DICT's admission that the cyberattacks originated from Chinese territory posed an issue of 'national security and public interest''\nBeijing's offer\nInformation and Communications Technology Secretary Ivan Uy had said Beijing offered to cooperate with his department in finding the cybercriminals, who may include third-party nationals.\nAsked whether it had information on Thursday's cyberattack on the PCG, the DICT said its tasks did not include monitoring social media pages like X and Facebook handled by the coast guard and other government agencies and was instead focused on their websites and network systems.\n'It is something internal to them. They didn't ask for assistance,' Information and Communications Technology Assistant Secretary Renato Paraiso told the Inquirer on Thursday.\nThe incident proves that hackers continue to launch cyberattacks despite stronger defenses being put up to ward them off, Paraiso said.\n'On a daily basis, these threat actors try to infiltrate our systems,' he said.\nParaiso said they help other agencies by providing cybersecurity guidelines and vetting appropriate information and communications technology equipment that would be used.\nIan Felipe, country manager of enterprise technology company Trend Micro Philippines, earlier said that government agencies are the usual targets of cyberattacks given the significant amount of sensitive information they handle.\n"

    "text": "\nIn the Harry Potter fantasy series characters are reluctant to name the chief villain. When they refer to him it is often as “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named” or “You-Know-Who”.\nSimilarly, Southeast Asian governments are reluctant to name – or even allude to – the regional Voldemort that is pushing them to take airpower more seriously.\nSource: Republic of Singapore Air ForceA Republic of Singapore Air Force F-16 in December 2022. Singapore is upgrading about 60 examples to the advanced F-16V standard\nBut although the name ‘China’ is unlikely to pass the lips of regional air chiefs and defence ministers in public, Beijing’s massive defence build-up is contributing to a sense of urgency with combat aircraft procurement in the region. Air forces are ordering new equipment and eyeing more potent capabilities.\nAnother spur is Russia’s war against Ukraine. Southeast Asian governments, having enjoyed decades of peaceful economic growth, have received a stark reminder that major conventional wars can and do still happen.\nAlthough the Chinese mainland lies well to the north of Southeast Asia, Beijing claims virtually the entire South China Sea – in contravention of international law. Despite assurances that it would not militarise the strategic text of water, Beijing has built air bases on Fiery Cross Reef and Subi Reef in the Spratly Islands, as well as two in the Paracel Islands, which are contested with Vietnam.\nThese strategic islands, as well as Beijing’s ambitions to build a fleet of aircraft carriers, put Southeast Asia within easy range of China’s vast aerial armada. \n“The PRC’s [People’s Republic of China’s] outposts on the Spratly Islands are capable of supporting military operations, including advanced weapon systems, and have supported non-combat aircraft,” reported the US Department of Defense in a recent report to the US Congress.\nREGULAR HARASSMENT\nWhile Beijing has yet to make a full-scale deployment of combat aircraft to its South China Sea air bases, its assets regularly harass foreign aircraft operating in international airspace over the contested waterway.\nAs the main victim of China’s expansion, the Philippines has been the most vocal about its concerns. Other countries are more wary of Beijing’s ire. China is, by a considerable margin, the region’s biggest trading partner, giving it profound economic leverage. Southeast Asian governments take considerable pains not to offend Beijing.\nStill, a greater emphasis on fighter procurement shows that governments are worried.\nMalcolm Davis, senior analyst, defence strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, has been vocal about the security challenge that Beijing represents.\n“In terms of accelerating the growth of fighter capability acquisition, I’d argue it would have to be the rapid growth and expansion of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force [PLAAF] and People’s Liberation Army Navy Air Force [PLANAF] and China’s more assertive posture and actions in the South China Sea,” says Davis.\n“There are no other security challenges in the region or facing Southeast Asia that would warrant a more ambitious growth of national air forces. Another contributing factor could be the need to replace older generation combat aircraft, and a degree of national prestige would factor into that policy choice as well.”\nSource: FlightGlobal/Greg WaldronAn RSAF F-15SG at the Singapore Airshow in February 2018. Officially Singapore has 24 F-15SGs, but it is understood that 40 are actually in service\nThe Southeast Asian nation most serious about defence is the region’s business and financial hub, Singapore. While the city-state has good relations with neighbours and with Beijing, it also has close defence ties with the USA and the broader Western world. By a considerable margin Singapore possesses Southeast Asia’s most advanced air force.\nThe mainstay of the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) fleet is the Boeing F-15SG. Officially the country admits to operating 24 examples, but it is understood that 40 are in service.\nCirium fleets data suggests that the average age of Singapore’s F-15SGs is 11.8 years. While Singapore has not announced any plans for upgrades, it is probably observing advances with the F-15EX, the much-upgraded version of the F-15 that is poised to enter service with the US Air Force.\nUPGRADE PATH\nSingapore is also in the process of upgrading about 60 Lockheed Martin F-16C/Ds to the F-16V standard, with the first upgraded example delivered in 2021.\nThe upgraded F-16 feature a new active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar in the form of the Northrop Grumman APG-83. It also has new mission computers, updated avionics, and the Link 16 datalink.\nThe upgraded type made its debut at the Forging Sabre Exercise in the USA in September 2023. Pilots interviewed by the Ministry of Defence’s in-house publication, Pioneer, said that the improvements make the aircraft far more lethal.\nSingapore is also set to become the first Southeast Asian nation to operate a stealth aircraft through its planned acquisition of 12 Lockheed F-35Bs. Singapore likely opted for the short-take off and vertical landing version of the F-35 owing to the country’s small geographic size and lack of large air bases. The first four examples will be delivered in 2026 and be based in the USA for training.\nThe aircraft will be co-located with upgraded F-16Vs at Ebbing Air National Guard Base in Arkansas, allowing the RSAF to experiment with operating the two types together.\nFinally, Singapore’s fighter fleet has invaluable back-up in the form of key support types, specifically six Airbus Defence & Space A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transports (MRTTs) and four Gulfstream G550 airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft. According to the defence ministry, the G550-AEW’s AESA radar – the Israel Aerospace Industries EL/W-2085 – has a detection range in excess of 174nm (322km).\nWhile Singapore has been assiduous about maintaining and advancing air combat capabilities, the same cannot be said of its northern neighbour, Malaysia.\nSource: Greg Waldron/FlightGlobalA Hawk 208 of the Royal Malaysian Air Force. The type was involved in the interception of Chinese transport aircraft over the South China Sea in 2021\nWhile Kuala Lumpur has tended to dither about defence procurements, it received a rude jolt in June 2021, when 16 PLAAF Xian Y-20 and Ilyushin Il-76 strategic transports flew an unprecedented sortie deep into the South China Sea region. The large formation flew southwards toward the coast of Borneo, approaching to within 60nm of Malaysian territory. Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) BAE Systems Hawk 208s intercepted the intruders.\nIn an analysis of the event, analyst Euan Graham offered a few possibilities. Beijing may have wanted to give Malaysia pause about exploiting new offshore oil resources in Kuala Lumpur’s exclusive economic zone. He also speculated that Beijing may have been conducting airlift training, and possibly probing Malaysia’s air defence capabilities.\nSUSTAINMENT ISSUES\nOn paper the RMAF is impressive, with a fleet of 18 Sukhoi Su-30MKMs. Although the type has suffered sustainment issues over the years, air force officials and local industry have said that the type can be kept airworthy.\nAerospace Technology Systems – a locally controlled joint venture between National Aerospace & Defence Industry and two Russian partners, RAC MiG and Rosoboronexport – has conducted service life extension work for the fleet.\nKuala Lumpur also operates eight Boeing F/A-18D Hornets. It acquired a number of spares and other equipment from the Royal Australian Air Force when the latter retired its fleet of F/A-18A/Bs in favour of the F-35A. In 2022, Malaysian defence minister Hishamuddin Hussein said that MYR2.4 billion ($687 million) would be invested on Hornet sustainment in 2023 in cooperation with the USA.\nRounding out its combat fleet are single-seat Hawk 208s tasked with ground attack.\nIn the late 2000s and early 2010s Malaysia had a long-running ambition to replace its now retired MiG-29s. It looked at a number of advanced fighters under its Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) requirement. After years of delay, MRCA was eventually dropped and replaced with a watered-down requirement for a Trainer-Light Combat Aircraft, or FLIR-LCA.\nHaving observed the glacial pace of Malaysian defence procurement, sceptics were surprised in February 2023 when the Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) FA-50 was selected for FLIR-LCA. A contract was duly signed at the Langkawi International Maricreated_at and Aerospace exhibition in May covering 18 aircraft, with deliveries starting in 2026. Long-term plans call for an additional 18 examples to be obtained.\nWhile FLIR-LCA is a step in the right direction, Malaysia lacks vital support assets, such as an AEW&C aircraft or dedicated tankers. This limits the capability afforded by its fighters.\nSource: Dassault AviationArtist’s Impression of a Rafale in Indonesian livery. Jakarta aims to order a total of 42 examples\nIndonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest country by population, is also nervous about China – and is investing in its air combat capabilities.\nIn February 2022, shortly before the last iteration of the Singapore air show, Jakarta committed to 42 Dassault Aviation Rafales. The €8.1 billion ($8.7 billion) package also includes crew training, logistical support for Indonesian air bases, and a training centre with two full-mission simulators.\nOn 8 January, Jakarta activated an order for its third and final tranche under the deal, totalling 18 of the multi-role aircraft.\nThe Rafales will offer a significant capability upgrade to Indonesia’s current combat fleet, the mainstay of which are 11 Su-30MK2s and five Su-27SK/SKMs with an average age of 14.2 years. Jakarta also operates 32 F-16s with an average age of 36.6 years. This fleet comprises nine F-16A/Bs, which are subject to a mid-life upgrade programme, and 23 F-16C/Ds.\nIn addition, Jakarta has 22 Hawk 209s and 13 Embraer EMB-314 Super Tucanos earmarked for the ground-attack mission.\nPrior to the Rafale buy, Indonesian officials had suggested that the choice was between the F-15EX and Rafale. Simultaneously with the Rafale order, the US government cleared Indonesia for the possible acquisition of 36 F-15EXs for up to $13.9 billion.\nAn Indonesian F-15EX buy appears to have traction. In August 2023, Jakarta entered a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Boeing about the acquisition of up to 24 of the type during a visit by defence minister Prabowo Subianto to the USA. The pact was signed at Boeing’s factory in St. Louis, Missouri, where it produces the F-15 and other combat aircraft.\n“We are pleased to announce our commitment to procure the critical F-15EX fighter capability for Indonesia,” said Subianto. “This state-of-the-art fighter will protect and secure our nation with its advanced capabilities.”\nFinalising the deal is contingent on the blessings of the US government.\nJakarta has also flirted with the acquisition of 12 surplus Dassault Mirage 2000-5s, via a proposed $735 million arrangement with Qatar. The fighters had been set to arrive in 2025 to fill a capability gap opened by the retirement of Northrop F-5s and the end of service life for Hawk 100/200s. In February, however, Indonesia’s defence ministry said the deal had been cancelled.\nSANCTIONS THREAT\nJakarta formerly had plans to replace the F-5s with Su-35s, but the threat of US sanctions under Washington DC’s Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act legislation killed this potential acquisition.\nAs with Malaysia, Indonesia is light on support assets for its fighter fleet. It lacks a dedicated AEW&C capability, but it could be close to ordering the A330 MRTT. In September 2023, the defence ministry indicated that four Airbus types are in “effective contract”: the A330 MRTT and A400M tactical transport, plus the Airbus Helicopters H225M transport and AS565 Panther naval helicopter.\nWhile the AS565 and H225M are already in service with Indonesia, and Jakarta has a firm order for a pair of A400Ms, no formal commitment for the A330 tanker/transport has been announced. Airbus, for its part, indicated that Indonesia has selected the MRTT, but suggested that details still need to be finalised.\nThe Rafale order and F-15EX MoU raised eyebrows in South Korea, where Jakarta is a 20% partner in KAI’s developmental KF-21 programme. Although Indonesian officials periodically state their commitment to the twin-engined fighter, persistent media reports suggest that Jakarta is chronically behind on payments. Jakarta’s clear interest in expensive, high-end western fighters is a cause for doubt about its commitment to the KF-21.\nIn addition, two Indonesians working on the programme in South Korea are being investigating amid allegations that they used a USB drive to steal technology related to the KF-21. FlightGlobal also understands that there is dissatisfaction in Indonesia with the level of technology transfer that South Korea is willing to provide. \nDavis feels that old patterns of rather ad hoc procurements are still a challenge in the region.\n“As is usual with Southeast Asian approaches to capability development, it is likely to be lacking in coherency in terms of how Southeast Asian air forces can maintain multiple types of different aircraft – usually bought in small numbers of each type – and ensure they are an effective capability,” he says.\n“This is particularly the case with states such as Indonesia and Malaysia. Clearly Singapore gets things right, and I think the Philippines is taking defence much more seriously in the face of challenges from China.”\nSource: US Air ForceTwelve FA-50 light-attack jets comprise Manila’s entire fast jet capability. The Phillippines is in discussions with the USA about a new multi-role fighter \nDespite facing a daunting security challenge from Beijing, the Philippines has been slow to reconstitute its fast jet capability, operating just 12 FA-50s. Still, this is a big improvement: after retiring its F-5s in 2004, the Philippines utterly lacked fast jets until the FA-50s started arriving in 2015. Manila also operates six Super Tucanos.\nFor years Manila has been considering a fighter buy, with the Saab Gripen and F-16 mooted as potential candidates. An F-16 buy appears more likely: in April, the USA said that discussions were underway for “a fleet of multi-role fighter aircraft for the Philippine air force” – reportedly for a dozen aircraft.\nOther Southeast Asian states, namely Thailand and Vietnam, are also assessing their airpower needs.\nBangkok was interested in the F-35, but the US government reportedly denied this request and the government has other funding priorities. Bangkok operates 112 fixed-wing combat aircraft, the majority of which are aging F-16A/Bs and F-5E/Fs, although both types have been subject to modernisation work. In addition, Thailand operates 11 Gripen C/Ds, and 18 Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jets in the ground-attack role.\nThailand is also the only Southeast Asian nation apart from Singapore to support its fighter fleet with an AEW&C capability, in the form of two Erieye radar-equipped Saab 340Bs.\nVietnam, also under pressure from China, faces the challenge of relying on a distracted Russia for its combat aircraft fleet, which comprises 79 aircraft, all from Sukhoi. The Vietnam People’s Air Force operates 35 Su-30MK2Vs, six Su-27SKs and five Su-27UBK trainers. Its surface attack capability resides in 33 Su-22s.\nHanoi could, however, look to the west for its next fighter investment. In September, Reuters reported that US President Joe Biden had raised the possibility of selling F-16s to Vietnam following a summit in Hanoi. Still, it could be some years before such a deal comes to fruition.\nSTEP CHANGE\nWhile the activity around regional fighter fleets is definitely a step change from the 2000s and 2010s, it is debatable whether China can truly be deterred.\n“In terms of missions, clearly the Southeast Asian states want a minimal air defence capability to deter lower-level threats by China, and to protect their airspace and offshore territories,” says Davis.\n“Whether their planned acquisitions will actually deliver such a deterrent capability is quite another thing, and once again, goes back to the individual state’s ability to sustain and operate the types of aircraft they are buying. But all of these acquisitions are likely to be piecemeal capability – and certainly won’t be a huge challenge to a large PLAAF/PLANAF capability.”\n"

    "text": "\nWashington, Feb 16 (EFE) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet with Chinese Chancellor Wang Yi this Friday on the occasion of the Munich Security Conference (MSC), which strengthens the improvement of diplomatic relations between the world's major powers in recent months.\nAccording to the U.S. State Department's agenda, Blinken and Wang will meet at 15.30 local created_at (GMT+1) in the German city, where the conference opens today with the attendance of around 50 heads of state and government, including Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenski and Israeli President Isaac Herzog.\nTheir meeting, not yet confirmed by the Chinese side, comes amid increased high-level diplomatic exchanges between the two countries following the face-to-face meeting between Chinese and U.S. Presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden on the occasion of the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit in San Francisco last November.\nAt that meeting, the leaders loosened bilateral relations, which were at their lowest point in decades due to trade and technology stumbling blocks and disagreements over Taiwan, among other issues, and agreed to reopen military communication channels and boost diplomatic ones.\nThus, Wang held meetings in late January in Bangkok with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, during which they discussed issues such as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the South China Sea -resource-rich waters that Beijing claims almost in their entirety-, and Taiwan, a self-governed island that China does not rule out invading and that the US would in principle defend.\nThese issues are also expected to be discussed between the top diplomats of the two countries, as well as the situation in the Red Sea, with Washington pressing Beijing to use its influence in Iran (of which Beijing is the largest trading partner) to persuade Tehran to persuade the Houthis, who are considered to be under its orbit, to curb their attacks on ships.\n The President of the European Commission (EC), Ursula von der Leyen, the head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, and leaders from the American continent, including Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo de León and US Vice-President Kamala Harris, will also be in the Bavarian capital.\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and 60 foreign ministers will also be in Munich, including Blinken, Wang, Britain's David Cameron, Spain's José Manuel Albares, Italy's Antonio Tajani, Argentina's Foreign Minister Diana Mondino and 25 defense ministers.

Marcos Jr. to attract foreign investments and improve the business climate.\n'Red carpet instead of red tape, this is the right motto,' Pfaffernoschke said during the forum at the Foreign Service Institute on Friday.\nHe added that the ease of doing business in the Philippines 'can be improved,' and positioning the Philippines as an attractive investment hub is a 'challenge' as it competes with other countries in attracting foreign capital.\nThe ease of doing business, he stressed, 'is much more than just making business easier.' It is also making 'sustainable and enduring efforts' improve the image and performance of the country as a 'safe and reliable' haven for investors.\n'The current discussion about the secession definitely does not increase trust and confidence for the investors,' envoy said.\nIn a side interview, Ambassador Pfaferrnoschke explained that political stability is 'definitely a very important condition for business and having an environment which is clear and stable.'\n'If you start discussing about to separate the country, that is the contrary to political stability. So, it would have definitely an effect that investors might think, 'Hey, is that a stable country? Is this country where I'm going to invest will exist 10 years from now because parts of it may secede,' the German ambassador said.\nAround 300 German companies have invested in the Philippines, including Porsche, Lufthansa, Siemens and Alianz Insurance, and other businesses ranging from BPO to manufacturing and pharmaceuticals.\nPBBM visit\nAttracting German businesses is one of the major objectives of the visit of President Marcos to Germany on March 12.\nPfaffernoschke said Germany's new foreign policy is for 'economic security and derisking.'\nPresident Marcos will have a number of meetings with German business leaders to attract German businesses to come to the Philippines, the envoy said.\nOn top of the agenda of the visit is the bilateral meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n'Chancellor Scholz invited President Marcos to come to Germany and they will definitely discuss all measures of bilateral interest, the international agenda as I referred to Russia's war against Ukraine, definitely the situation in the South China Sea,' Ambassador Pfaffernoschke said.\n"

But he gave little information on other topics the top diplomats took up.\n Blinken reiterated that the United States will continue to stand up for its interests and values and those of its allies, he said.\n Despite long-running tensions over issues including Taiwan's future, human rights and trade restrictions, the United States and China have sought to responsibly manage differences and cooperate where they can.\n Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, and Wang held more than 12 hours of discussions over two days last month in Thailand, with issues on the table including military-to-military communication, the safety of artificial intelligence, Taiwan's future and attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by the Iran-backed Houthis.\n It was the first in-person meeting of senior officials of the two countries since Taiwan's presidential election in mid-January, won by Lai Ching-te of the ruling, independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party.\n Following their talks in Bangkok, a senior U.S. administration official said President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to hold talks over the phone this spring.\n Blinken's meeting with Wang on the margins of the Munich Security Conference was also intended to follow up on the summit of the U.S. and Chinese presidents near San Francisco in November.\n Biden and Xi agreed at the created_at to reopen military-to-military lines of communication at several levels and work together on transnational challenges such as counternarcotics to help foster confidence between the geopolitical rivals.\n Since then, despite disagreements over various political and economic issues, the United States and China have gradually taken steps to restart cooperation where possible.\n In late January, they launched a working group to help choke off exports of ingredients for fentanyl, which is fueling a deadly drug crisis in the United States.\n The two countries also plan to begin a dialogue this spring on the safe use of artificial intelligence.\n==Kyodo\n"

    "title": "A more muscular 'Indonesia First' foreign policy under Prabowo'",
    "created_at": "2024-02-16",
    "text": "\nWith Mr Prabowo Subianto set to become the next president, Indonesia's foreign policy is likely to shift, reflecting the nationalist instincts of the 72-year-old leader.\n While the fundamental underpinnings of Indonesia's traditional non-aligned \"free and active\" foreign policy stance are not likely to change, Mr Prabowo can be expected to be more vocal and assertive in making the case for Indonesia's interests on the world stage. \n An early indicator of the defence minister's \"Indonesia First\" approach can be found, for instance, in his campaign rally speeches. At a recent one in South Sulawesi, he declared: \"I strongly object to seeing my people cheated out of their dues by foreign nations. I truly object!\"\n On several occasions in the past, the well-travelled Mr Prabowo alluded to how foreigners often looked down on Indonesians and how that riled him.\n His desire to see Indonesians \"catch up\" with the rest of the world shows up in a variety of ways, big and small. It surfaces in his campaign promise to provide free lunches and milk to prevent \"stunting\" in Indonesian children. \"All the First World countries ran this scheme and still do in one way or another,\" he said.\n Replying to a question on the fate of Rohingya refugees during one of the December presidential debates, he said that while Indonesia should sympathise with their plight, his government would always put the interests of Indonesians first when considering aid for others.\n At the same event, Mr Prabowo proudly related the story of how he helped save Indonesian migrant worker Wilfrida Soik, convicted of murdering her Malaysian employer, from the gallows in 2015, to illustrate that he would always put fellow Indonesians first. \n This \"Indonesia First\" outlook will likely filter through in created_at into his decisions on defence, economics and diplomacy.\n US-China rivalryIn response to a recent question about his intended policy on the South China Sea disputes, Mr Prabowo reiterated his determination to \"beef up\" the navy to better enable it to defend Indonesia's interests at sea.\n Indonesia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around the Natuna Islands overlaps Beijing's claims in the waterway. Tensions have risen in recent years, with Chinese fishing boats and coast guard vessels encroaching into Indonesia's EEZ.\n That said, Mr Prabowo has toned down his past anti-China rhetoric in his third shot at the presidency. At a talk at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, Jakarta in October 2023, he was careful not to appear partisan in the United States-China rivalry. Instead, he said he respected both powers, but emphasised his new-found admiration for China in having successfully lifted the majority of its people out of poverty.\n We can be sure that in managing the Sino-US tussle for influence, Mr Prabowo will adhere to the decades-old cornerstone of Indonesian foreign policy: To play an independent \"free and active\" role in world affairs.\n During the Cold War, then President Sukarno was adept at playing the US against the USSR, extracting US concessions on West Papua against the Dutch and succeeding in obtaining Soviet military hardware on soft loans at the same created_at.\n No doubt, always priding himself as a keen student of history, Mr Prabowo will try his hardest to replicate the first president's feats in getting the most out of both Washington and Beijing while seeking to remain on cordial terms with them at the same created_at.\n As if to underscore the point of being non-partisan, Mr Prabowo has on several occasions declared that he will be guided by the principle of \"a thousand friends aren't enough while one enemy is too many\" -- a phrase coined by former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. \n Economic policiesIn the economic sphere, Mr Prabowo will likely want to give the impression, for the benefit of his domestic audience at the very least, that he remains true to his \"Indonesia First\" policy.\n During the election campaign, he repeatedly praised President Joko Widodo's policy of resource nationalism. Mr Widodo's initiatives on insisting that the processing of nickel and other minerals be done in Indonesia will also be key elements of his policy to ensure that Indonesia escapes the \"middle income trap\", he pledged.\n But, over created_at, as Mr Prabowo's self-confidence grows while in office, it won't be surprising if he decides to develop his own initiatives and generally go his own way. This is especially so if the Indonesian Solidarity Party, with Mr Widodo's younger son Kaesang Pangarep at its helm, fails once again to get a place in the House of Representatives. This means that Mr Widodo would not have a party as his \"vehicle\" in Parliament once he steps down from office. His elder son Gibran Rakabuming Raka may not have much influence, as the vice-presidency carries little power under Indonesia's Constitution.\n While Mr Prabowo's instincts are nationalist, an \"Indonesia First\" policy will have to be tempered when dealing with global economic powers like China and the US. Indonesia, after all, needs foreign investment to continue its economic growth. Mega infrastructure projects like the new capital city, Nusantara, still require foreign investment to make them feasible. China will remain a key player in the growth of sectors such as e-commerce, minerals processing, and the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles.\n Economic reality may bite even sooner, as Mr Prabowo has promised to embark on ambitious welfare programmes like the free lunch and milk scheme for children, putting further strain on an already overstretched budget.\n On the global stageAs he comes from a family with a tradition of holding public office -- his grandfather was the founder of Indonesia's reserve bank -- and a cosmopolitan background -- his early years were spent abroad in various places including London and Zurich -- we can expect Mr Prabowo to adopt a higher profile on the global stage than President Widodo.\n As president, Mr Prabowo can be expected to reaffirm Indonesia's position as \"first among equals\" within Asean. It is not impossible that he may attempt a double-pronged initiative to solve the domestic problem of Rohingya refugees landing on Indonesia's shores by also trying to have a go at tackling the complex challenge that is Myanmar.\n The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation is another forum in which Mr Prabowo may choose to be proactive, given his well-cultivated links with leaders in the Middle East. He has especially warm ties with the Jordanian royal family, who sheltered him for some years after the fall of President Suharto in the 1990s.\n But Indonesia under Mr Prabowo may also become a volatile and unpredictable player in global affairs. His Ukraine Peace Plan initiative unveiled at the 2023 Shangri-La Dialogue, which raised eyebrows worldwide and was criticised by Ukraine for being \"unworkable\", is a prime example.\n Coming into the presidency at an advanced age will put pressure on Mr Prabowo to think about the kind of legacy he wants to leave behind, especially if he ends up as a one-term president.\n He is, in short, pressed for created_at. Foreign policy ambitions may have to wait. \n Building bridges with rivalsFor now, Mr Prabowo's priority is to rebuild bridges with his political rivals in order to assemble a strong enough coalition to carry out his agenda with minimal friction.\n He has signalled on several occasions that he would emulate Mr Widodo who, despite their past rivalry, appointed him as his defence minister in 2019.\n \"When the Prabowo-Gibran ticket wins, we will extend our hands to reach out to all,\" he said, to the applause of his supporters.\n Nevertheless, embracing all political rivals may be tricky, especially with the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), whose leaders understandably feel betrayed by Mr Widodo's failure to endorse its candidate, Mr Ganjar Pranowo, in the presidential race.\n The uneasy circumstances in which Indonesia's election took place this year add to the challenges for the next president. Not only does Mr Prabowo have to mend the fractures within Indonesia after a bitterly fought campaign, but he also has to assure the international community that as the \"continuity\" candidate, he will maintain Indonesia's nascent democracy.\n Johannes Nugroho is a journalist and political analyst from Surabaya, Indonesia.\n\nGraphic\n \nMr Prabowo Subianto at a campaign rally in Jakarta on Feb 10. While the fundamental underpinnings of Indonesia's non-aligned \"free and active\" foreign policy stance are not likely to change, Mr Prabowo can be expected to be more vocal in making the case for Indonesia's interests on the world stage.

    "text": "\nEx-president Duterte's light-touch approach is out, with Manila and Washington now united in opposing 'maricreated_at expansionism', analysts sayBut some fear the Philippines will become 'the ants that get trampled on' as the potential for a US-China conflict heats up in the disputed waterway\nConcerns are growing among some in the Philippines that closer military ties with the United States are turning the Southeast Asian nation into a \"proxy\" for American interests against China, as the two superpowers jostle for influence. \nTens of thousands of Filipino and American troops took part in a series of joint drills last year and the exercises have continued into 2024, with the latest - a \"maricreated_at cooperative activity\" in the South China Sea held on February 9 - the third such training manoeuvre in four months. \n\"We are rehearsing,\" said Colonel Michael Logico, director of the Philippine Armed Forces Joint and Combined Training Centre, referring to exercises aimed at boosting interoperability with US forces and familiarising Filipino soldiers with the latest weaponry. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Duterte later backed down amid pressure from the Philippine military, and as billions in promised Chinese investments failed to materialise. \nDefence analysts say Manila and Washington are now united in their opposition to Beijing's \"maricreated_at expansionism\" in the South China Sea, which the latter claims almost in its entirety. \nIn the past year alone, the Philippines has complained about Chinese coastguard and militia vessels using water cannons and military-grade lasers against its ships, engaging in \"dangerous blocking manoeuvres\" and repeatedly harassing Filipino fishermen. \nChina, for its part, has issued statements accusing Filipinos of \"illegally intruding\" into disputed reefs and threatening to \"respond resolutely\" to the construction of any permanent structures in areas of the waterway it claims - despite building and fortifying seven artificial islands in the South China Sea itself. \n\"What annoys [China] is that we have a defence treaty with the US,\" Logico said. \nAlongside the large-scale military drills, joint maricreated_at patrols, training exercises and acquisition of hardware, the Philippines has also allowed US forces to access an increasing number of military bases in the country since President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr took office in 2022. \nThe two countries, bound by a 1951 mutual defence treaty, agreed last year to expand the number of sites covered by their Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) to nine from the initial four - to respond to \"shared challenges\", as a Pentagon spokesman euphemistically put it at the created_at. \nNew sites approved under the expanded EDCA, which was first signed in 2014 and allows US troops extended rotational stay inside Philippine bases, include one on the northeastern tip of Luzon island, around 400km from Taiwan. \nThe EDCA sites evoke memories of two giant Cold War-era US bases, the largest outside America at the created_at. \nFor more than 40 years, Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base - alongside 23 other installations - were for the exclusive use of the Americans, with the Philippines having little or no say in the matter. Packed with US ships, aircraft and troops, they also stored nuclear weapons. \nSuccessive administrations in Manila defined their nationalism by either supporting or opposing the bases, though in private all supported them for \"protecting\" the Philippines from communist aggression. \nThe fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, which coincided with a volcanic eruption that covered the bases in ash and the Philippines' refusal to renew leases on both following a dispute over rent, led to the US abandoning them a year later. \nCircumstances have changed in the decades since. In December, the Philippines' House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning Chinese aggression in the West Philippine Sea, as Manila calls the parts of the South China Sea within its exclusive economic zone, and calling on the government to continue asserting its rights. \nBut the country's defence budget remains low compared to its neighbours. Last year, Manila spent just over US$7 billion on its military, less than Malaysia's US$8.9 billion, Singapore's US$17 billion, Indonesia's US$18 billion - and far behind the US$377 billion China reportedly spent. \nThe Philippines is slowly modernising its military. But it has only recently started to acquire the missiles, tanks, fighter jets, drones and radar needed to maintain a credible defence posture. It currently has no submarines. \n\"We are going for interoperability,\" Colonel Logico said. \"We are trying to see, if we go to war, are our ... soldiers familiar with the capabilities of our treaty allies? \n\"To work together we need to have the same terminologies, appreciation of the operational environment,\" he added. \nNot everyone agrees with drawing closer to the US, however, and they warn about the Philippines turning into a \"proxy\" for American interests. The president's own sister Imee, a senator, told ANC Digital earlier this month that \"China will always be our neighbour, we have no fight with them, let's not get dragged into a fight that's not our own.\" \nAnna Rosario Malindog-Uy, director of the pro-China Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute, wrote in the Manila created_ats on February 10 that \"agreements such as the EDCA, the VFA and the Mutual Defence Treaty have not only cemented the US military presence and influence in the Philippines but also, most importantly, exemplified the Philippines' dependence on the US in the military and defence sector.\" \nTeresita Ang See, former president of the Philippine Association for Chinese Studies and currently part of its advisory council, told This Week in Asia: \"Filipinos in general condemn China's action. But many also understand that China's assertiveness is in response to US, Japanese and Australian provocations and increasing military presence in the Philippines.\" \nShe warned that \"we are fighting a proxy war between the US and China and in the end we will be the ants that get trampled upon\". \nChester Cabalza, founder and president of the International Development and Security Cooperation think tank, disagreed with this definition, noting that \"a proxy war [only] commences when there is a military conflict\". \nAnother defence analyst, who asked not to be named, stressed that the Philippines did have \"legitimate interests\" in regards to China that shared \"some similarities\" with those of the US. \n\"It is the duty of any nation to protect its territorial and maricreated_at interests. To argue that we are simply being used as pawns is Chinese propaganda,\" he said. \nFor Colonel Logico, stepping up military exercises with the US is all about \"deterring China\". \"We are sending the message, you know, you want to try your luck with us, we are ready for you,\" he told This Week in Asia. \n\"I belong to the armed forces, I'm in uniform. I will always see things from the realist perspective,\" Logico said. \"I'm aware of the Thucydides trap - the idea that a rising power will eventually collide with an existing power. And one way to avoid this is through deterrence ... discouraging the other party from making any overt acts that will take aggression a step further.\" \nThe idea that China could displace the US as the Philippines' main ally had crossed his mind during the Duterte administration, he revealed. \n\"There was a created_at when I really thought it would happen. But China committed one strategic error. They did not deliver what they promised,\" Logico said. \nAfter a state visit to Beijing in 2016, Duterte said China had promised the Philippines US$24 billion worth of investments, aid and loans. But by 2021 only US$3.2 billion worth of investments had been recorded by Manila's National Economic Development Authority, in addition to two bridges for the capital costing 4.8 billion pesos (US$85.6 million) that Beijing donated. \nBefore Duterte left office in June 2022, all remaining loans that were still under negotiation had been cancelled, including for three key rail projects. \nDuterte's was \"the most China-friendly administration the Philippines has seen\", said the Filipino defence analyst who declined to be identified. But during his six years in power \"China actually delivered quite little\". \nThe shift away from Duterte's pro-China stance has met with little resistance as most Filipinos are traditionally pro-American. Millions of Filipino-Americans live in the United States and it remains a popular goal to emigrate to the country. \nIn fact, a 2014 survey by the Pew Research Centre's Global Attitudes Project found that 85 per cent of Filipinos had favourable views of the US - compared to just 84 per cent of Americans. \nA more recent poll conducted by survey firm Pulse Asia, whose findings were published last month, showed that eight in 10 Filipinos wanted their country to work with the US - as well as Australia, Japan, Canada and Britain - to resolve the South China Sea issue. \nOnly one in 10 said they would prefer to work with China. In the same survey, 67 per cent of respondents said they believed in the need to strengthen the Philippines' external defence capability, especially its navy, air force and coastguard. \nIn terms of its organisation, training, equipment and traditions, the Philippines' military has long imitated that of the US. \nEven Duterte observed as much in June 2017, telling reporters after seeing the close cooperation between Filipino and US soldiers during the retaking of Marawi City from Islamist militants: \"This is really the sencreated_atnt of our soldiers. They are really pro-American, that I cannot deny.\" \nHe credited this to the fact that \"almost all [Filipino] officers will go to America to study about militaristic things. That's why they have this rapport and I cannot deny that\". \nBy contrast, the first created_at any Filipino officer studied in Beijing was during the Duterte administration's pivot to China when a handful were sent there as part of an exchange programme, according to military sources who asked not to be named. \nMeanwhile, even religious officials have, in effect, given their blessing to the current government's efforts to seek allies against China. In a \"joint pastoral exhortation\" dated February 8, six bishops from the Philippines' Catholic Church stated: \"It is no secret that the aggressive incursions of the Chinese into our maricreated_at zones\" had resulted in the destruction of maricreated_at resources and \"wrought havoc on the lives of our fisherfolk\". \nThe bishops, coming from areas with fishing communities, said that in the absence of effective diplomacy, \"then it is permissible - morally necessary even - to have recourse to the friendship of allies who can help us defend what is ours\". \nThe real danger lies in escalation. The Philippines maintains that its military alliance with the US, and partnerships with other countries such as Japan, are defensive in nature. Beijing sees it as part of a pattern of encirclement. \nChina has already used water cannons and other aggressive tactics against Philippine vessels. What might come next is unknown. The language has also become more heated. Beijing has said it would oppose \"illegal construction\", referring to Manila's plans to upgrade outposts on islands and reefs it controls. On February 8, China warned the Philippines to \"refrain from playing with fire\" by building up its military presence on islands near Taiwan. \nManila's defence department fired back a testy reply. \"China has no business warning the Philippines what it does within its territory,\" it said, adding: \"China's pronouncements and acts are the main reasons for its low credibility with the American people.\" Philippine officials have said that this year's Balikatan exercise with the US, scheduled for April, might include drills on and around Mavulis, an island in the Batanes archipelago just 150km southeast of Taiwan where the military is building a base. \nIn a recent forum, Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute's Malindog-Uy said: \"The South China Sea issue should not define the entire relationship between China and the Philippines because that is too small ... if only people and the government of both countries would see it that way, then probably a military confrontation in the South China Sea will never happen.\" \n\"However, if this template is not managed properly, a third country like the United States will come into the picture and push the Philippines to ... provoke China ... a third world war is possible,\" she added. \nThe US has made it clear that in the event of an attack on Philippine forces, the mutual defence treaty will be activated and Washington will come to Manila's aid. \nAsked if the Philippines could go it alone without its main ally, Logico said: \"We are trying to get there. Once we transition away from internal security, then we can focus all our capability for external defence. If you want things done fast, you do it alone.\" \n\"But if you want things done faster, you do it with friends. I see no strong reason why you shouldn't do it with your treaty ally,\" he added. \"Is it inevitable that we need allies? Yes, we need them. We are not yet on the right footing. Besides, the US also needs us.\" \n\"If you are expected to die for your country, if you were in my position, you would also use everything to your advantage. Would you want to do this alone or with a strategic ally? It would be stupid not to use an ally.\" \nCopyright (c) 2024. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd. All rights reserved. \n"

MILAN is a biennial multilateral naval exercise which was introduced by Indian Navy in the year 1995. This initiative is in align with the Indias Act East Policy and its Indo-Pacific approaches to provide Security and Growth for all in the Region (SAGAR) by inviting Friendly Foreign Countries (FFCs) at the Eastern seaboard in Visakhapatnam during the exercise. The exercise will involve various naval operations, including large-force manoeuvres, advanced air defence operations, anti-submarine warfare, and anti-surface warfare operations. What are its Objectives? Milan 24 will consist of two main phases the harbour phase and the sea phase. The harbour phase aims to promote cultural sharing among participating nations through various events and exhibitions. #MILAN2024 Forging Naval Alliances For a Secure Maricreated_at Future 12th edition of the #MILAN exercise to be held at #Visakhapatnam 19 - 27 Feb 24 aims to provide a platform for the participating navies to share ideas to enhance #security on the high seas ensure safety of pic.twitter.com/0Q2tPFq4up SpokespersonNavy (@indiannavy) February 16, 2024 In contrast, the sea phase will focus on joint naval exercises and operations. Milan serves as a testament to Indias commitment to promoting maricreated_at cooperation and security in the Indian Ocean Region, highlighting the importance of international collaboration in addressing common challenges and ensuring a secure maricreated_at environment. India is poised to flex its naval muscle in the upcoming Milan drills, underscoring its commitment to ensuring a secure and stable Indo-Pacific region amidst escalating tensions with China. Set against the backdrop of Chinas assertiveness in the region, the Milan exercises will witness an armada of 50 navies converging in the strategically vital Bay of Bengal, sending a resolute message of unity and cooperation in safeguarding maricreated_at security and upholding the rules-based international order. Why Indo-Pacific countries should participate? Chinas increasing muscle-flexing in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in the East and South China Seas, has spurred concerns among regional stakeholders, necessitating concerted efforts to uphold peace and stability. Beijing is well aware that countries like the Philippines and Vietnam seek major powers involvement in the South China Sea dispute, particularly the United States and India. Beijing has created_at and again accused the United States of provoking Manila over the lingering South China Sea dispute. It is a known fact that the United States desires India to play a key role and act as a contender against China. To show its support, India, for the first created_at, explicitly called for adherence not only to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) but also to the 2016 Arbitral Award in the Joint Statement issued in June 2023. On the other hand, the United States has strengthened its relations with Vietnam and the Philippines. The United States and Vietnam elevated their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership on 10 September 2023. Regarding the Philippines, the United States has reaffirmed its commitment to the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. This strengthened position with the United States and India by the Philippines and Vietnam could make China even more wary. With the increasing tension in the South China Sea between the Philippines and China in the Second Thomas Shoal beginning of this year, there is a high chance of de-escalation and conflicts between the two which is not unusual. The Philippines Coast Guard (PCG) has accused China of dangerous and blocking manoeuvres while its vessel patrolled near Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Four Chinese maricreated_at militia vessels were also present near the shoal. ASEAN countries at MILAN 2024 All the ASEAN countries are expected to participate in MILAN 2024. Participation from all ASEAN countries in MILAN 2024 could be motivated by various security reasons: Regional Stability: Ensuring participation from all ASEAN nations can foster a sense of unity and cooperation within the region, contributing to overall stability. By actively engaging in events like MILAN, countries can strengthen their ties and build trust, which are essential for maintaining peace and security. Information Sharing: MILAN provides a platform for sharing maricreated_at security information, intelligence, and best practices. Full participation from ASEAN countries allows for a comprehensive exchange of information regarding common security threats such as piracy, terrorism, and illegal trafficking, thereby enhancing the collective ability to address these challenges effectively. Capacity Building: Participation in MILAN offers opportunities for capacity building in areas such as maricreated_at law enforcement, search and rescue operations, and disaster response. By engaging in exercises and workshops during the event, ASEAN countries can improve their capabilities and readiness to respond to security threats in the maricreated_at domain. Deterrence against Threats: A unified presence of ASEAN countries in MILAN can serve as a deterrent against potential security threats in the region. The collective demonstration of resolve and coordination sends a strong message to adversaries that any destabilizing actions will be met with a united response from ASEAN nations. Crisis Management: In the event of a maricreated_at crisis or emergency situation, having all ASEAN countries involved in MILAN ensures a coordinated and swift response. This can include joint exercises to rehearse crisis management procedures, as well as the establishment of communication channels and protocols for information sharing during emergencies. Promotion of Rules-Based Order: Full participation in MILAN reaffirms ASEAN countries commitment to upholding the rules-based international order, including respect for maricreated_at laws and regulations. By actively engaging in multilateral security initiatives like MILAN, ASEAN nations contribute to the promotion of a stable and predictable environment in the maricreated_at domain. Recommendations: How India can Leverage Milan to strengthen Maricreated_at Cooperation India should use MILAN 2024 as an opportunity to enhance maricreated_at cooperation with friendly nations. The exercises focus on joint naval operations presents a platform for India to collaborate closely with participating countries in addressing common security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. India should underscore its commitment to ensuring a secure and stable Indo-Pacific region amidst escalating tensions with China. Through active participation and leadership in MILAN exercises, India can demonstrate its resolve to uphold maricreated_at security and promote peace and stability in the region. India should emphasize its adherence to international laws and conventions, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). By promoting adherence to established norms and rules, India can position itself as a responsible maricreated_at actor committed to upholding the rules-based international order. India should actively engage with other Indo-Pacific countries participating in MILAN to strengthen regional cooperation. By fostering partnerships and collaborative efforts, India can work together with like-minded nations to address common security threats, including Chinas assertiveness in the region. India should use MILAN 2024 as an opportunity to address the South China Sea dispute and express support for countries seeking major powers involvement in resolving the issue. By advocating for peaceful resolution and adherence to international law, India can contribute to efforts aimed at de-escalating tensions and promoting stability in the South China Sea. India should use MILAN as a platform for promoting dialogue and diplomacy among participating nations. By engaging in constructive discussions and exchanges, India can build trust and cooperation with regional partners, contributing to a peaceful and secure maricreated_at environment in the Indo-Pacific.\n"

Beijing claims historical sovereignty against neighbouring countries over the contested waters that fall within what it calls the \"nine-dash line\". \nTensions between China and the Philippines have intensified in recent months, with frequent stand-offs taking place near Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal, territories that both and other countries claim as their own. \nCopyright (c) 2024.

Chinese experts noted that as risks of both bilateral and international conflicts are on the rise, Wang's meeting with Blinken marks another round of efforts between China and the US in managing disputes, stabilizing ties and de&; it also paves way for more frequent and higher-level meetings between the two countries. \nWang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said the most important task for both sides currently is to follow the strategic guidance of the two heads of state to make the \"San Francisco vision\" a reality, so as to promote a sound, steady and sustainable development of bilateral relations.\nTo this end, the two sides should adhere to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation and actively explore the right way for the two major countries to get along with each other, Wang noted.\nThe US side should view China's development objectively and rationally, and adopt a positive and pragmatic policy toward China, and implement President Biden's commitments into concrete actions, Wang added.\nDuring the meeting, the two sides had candid, substantive and constructive discussions, according to Xinhua News Agecy.\nThe important signal being conveyed is the need to manage and stabilize the relationship between the two sides, while also exchanging views on major regional and global issues, so as to prevent overall global security from being completely undermined, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global created_ats on Saturday.\nAnother signal from Wang's conversation with Blinken is to maintain the momentum of high-level meetings between the two countries, laying the groundwork for more frequent and higher-level interactions between officials in the future, according to Li. \nA handout of the meeting between Wang and Blinken published by the US State Department said that both sides recognized the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between the two countries across a range of strategic issues, including consultations and high-level meetings in key areas in the coming months.\nChina and the US have continued to build momentum for interactions in various fields after the meeting of the two heads of state in San Francisco. However, the US sincerity toward improving ties with China has been widely questioned by Chinese experts. Li said the US has never abandoned its two-faced approach to China - seeking engagement with China while strengthening competition and keeping up provocations on certain issues, especially the South China Sea issue and the Taiwan question.\nDuring his meeting with Blinken, Wang stressed that that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China's territory, which is the true status quo of the Taiwan question. He noted that what is trying to change the status quo are the \"Taiwan independence\" separatist activities and the connivance and support of external forces.\nIf the US genuinely hopes for stability across the Taiwan Straits, it should abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, and carry out its commitment of not supporting \"Taiwan independence,\" Wang said.\nSpeaking with the Global created_ats on Wednesday, Wu Shicun, president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, who is currently attending the Munich Security Conference, said that although the risk of conflicts for China and the US in the South China Sea is rising, both sides are trying to avoid such conflicts as it would be catastrophic for the world to bear. He warned that if the US is not willing to follow the current rules and keeps provoking on the South China Sea issue, such conflicts will be very likely in the future. \nLi said Wang's emphasis on the Taiwan question is also to warn the US not to fan the flames on this question, as neither side wants the Taiwan question to become a new crisis in the Asia-Pacific region. Both sides are aware that Taiwan's newly elected regional leader Lai Ching-te will indeed inject a great deal of uncertainty into cross-Straits relations.\nOn the Taiwan question, experts pointed out that Lai's inauguration speech in May is worth noting. Wu said the US is also pressuring the island of Taiwan at various levels, so they won't go across the red line and give the Chinese central government more reasons to expedite the process of national reunification. Taiwan cannot act as it wishes and must take into account the pressure from the US, said Wu.\nWang and Blinken also agreed to continue promoting dialogue and consultation on foreign policies, Asia-Pacific affairs, maricreated_at affairs and artificial intelligence, and maintain communication between the two militaries.\nThe two sides also exchanged views on the Ukrainian crisis, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Korean Peninsula and other regional hot spot issues, and agreed to maintain contact between the two sides' special envoys for the Korean Peninsula affairs. \n"

    "text": "\n Manila has ordered increased deployment of Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) vessels in Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal in the West Philippine Sea, aimed mainly at protecting the country's interests and fishermen in the area.\nNational Security Adviser Eduardo Año announced yesterday that such initiatives are being carried out 'in line with the vision of 'Bagong Pilipinas' in achieving food security as a pivotal element in national development.'\nHe declared that the Philippine government has taken decisive\naction to protect the rights and safety of Filipino fishermen in the waters of Bajo de Masinloc.\nAño said the national government has directed the PCG and BFAR to deploy their vessels on rotation in the area starting this month.\nHe said the PCG vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua (MRRV-9701) recently completed a successful patrol from Feb. 1 to 9 while the BFAR vessel BRP Datu Tamblot (MMOV-3005) has been conducting patrols in the waters of Panatag Shoal since Feb. 14 and continues to do so.\n'These efforts aim to ensure the safety and security of our Filipino fishermen in their traditional fishing grounds. Further, both PCG and BFAR were also directed to distribute food packs, groceries and even fuel to support the fishermen in sustaining their activities in the vicinity of Bajo de Masinloc,' Año said.\nHe stressed that there is no truth to the statement of the China Coast Guard (CCG) that it expelled a BFAR vessel and PCG vessel that allegedly intruded into their waters.\n'The National Security Council reaffirms the Philippines' sovereign rights and jurisdiction over Bajo de Masinloc and its surrounding waters within the Philippine exclusive economic zone. These rights are recognized under international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 Arbitral Award,' Año said.\n'It is crucial to emphasize that the activities of the Filipino fishermen and the PCG and BFAR vessels in BDM are fully compliant with national laws and consistent with the Philippines' position on the West Philippine Sea. Any attempts by state actors to intimidate or drive away our fishermen are clear violations of international law and disregard the decision of the Arbitral Award,' he noted.\nAño announced that despite the challenges, the PCG and BFAR vessels will maintain professionalism in dealing with any unlawful and provocative behavior exhibited by CCG and the Chinese maricreated_at militia vessels, including responding to dangerous and blocking maneuvers that blatantly disregard the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea of 1972.\n'The National Task Force on the West Philippine Sea reassures the Filipino people that our member agencies are fully dedicated to upholding our commitment to the President and the nation. Through a comprehensive whole-of-government approach, we stand unwavering in our mission to protect our sovereignty and safeguard our national interests in the West Philippine Sea,' he said.\nNot an offshoot\nThe Philippines' top diplomat disagreed with a 'tendency' to present the South China Sea dispute as a result of the rivalry between the United States and China, saying it sets aside the Philippines' legitimate rights and interests of countries.\nIn his remarks at the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines media forum on Thursday, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo said subscribing to the prism of US-China rivalry 'does not help in an honest understanding of the situation.'\n'Firstly, it puts distinct and legitimate rights and interests of countries such as the Philippines aside, and secondary to the interests of the rivals,' Manalo said.\n'Secondly, it purposely obscures good judgment: actions that are clearly illegal in international law and against the UN Charter are somecreated_ats rationalized under the pretext of this rivalry,' he added.\nThe US-China rivalry is highlighted in attempts to disregard legitimate responses to illegal actions.\n'As I have emphasized in many previous remarks, the future of the Indo Pacific, resting on abiding peace and resilience in the face of risks, is being shaped not just by one or two powers, but by many actors, each with their agency and legitimate interests and voice,' he added.\nManalo emphasized the Philippines' role as vanguard of the rule of law, particularly the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea as the fundamental and only arbiter of the overlapping claims and disputes in the South China Sea, can be seen as an extension of Philippine good global citizenship.\n"

The 2022 NSS underscores Japan's desire to arm regional countries and uphold the regional order, particularly in the face of \"China's growing attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force\". \nThe OSA will be used for three main areas: ensuring peace and stability based on the rule of the law; humanitarian activities; and international peacekeeping. \nIn November and December 2023, Japanallocatednearly 2 billion yen (US$18.2 million) to four countries — Bangladesh, Fiji, Malaysia and the Philippines. This included 600 million yen to the Philippines for coastal radar systems and 400 million yen for rescue boats used for monitoring and surveillance by the Malaysian Armed Forces. The total figure is reported toriseto 5 billion yen in the next fiscal year ending March 2025. \nIt should be noted that Japan took many years to come up with the OSA scheme. There has always been an underlying tension between the country's pacifistic principles and the imperative to enhance the military capabilities of partners who would jointly uphold a rules-based order in response to the changing balance of power in the region (Japan's \"proactive contribution to peace\", as coined by the late PremierShinzo Abe). \nFor years, Japan maintained that its Official Development Assistance (ODA)cannot be usedto transfer military materiel to other countries, but only for economic and social development. This, however, did not stop Japan from a sleight of hand. \nIn 2015, Japan gave ODA a \"strategic edge\", which enables Japan to send vessels, aircraft and radar systems to help South China Sea claimant states augment their maricreated_at surveillance capabilities. \nUnder this scheme, some military-grade equipment was transferred or sold to Southeast Asian countries. \nFor example, ten vessels of the Japanese Maricreated_at Self-Defence Force's Bizan-class patrol boats were transferred to the Philippines. In 2021, Japan signed a deal with Indonesia to sell eight Mogami-class frigates. The sale of the naval vessels was deftlycategorisedas a \"joint development\" to sidestep an arms export ban.  \n... the OSA [Official Security Assistance] provides a more open and direct way for Japan to provide grants for defence equipment and associated infrastructure for Southeast Asian militaries.  \nOSA: modest at best \nUnderstandably, the use of ODA (and associated sleights of hand) to provide capacity-building for law enforcement and military forces wasinconsistent. Compared to the ODA regime, the OSA provides a more open and direct way for Japan to provide grants for defence equipment and associated infrastructure for Southeast Asian militaries. \nStill, the OSA remains modest at best, and its effectiveness in beefing up the deterrent capabilities of regional countries depends on how far Japan is willing to go with the scheme. \nTechnically, the OSA restricts Japan to areas such as rescue, transport, warning, surveillance and minesweeping. A clear example of this is the transfer of coastal radar systems to the Philippines in November 2023. There issome debatein Japan about allowing the export of lethal weapons, such as surveillance ships armed with weapons. But change will take created_at. \nThere is also a bureaucratic hurdle: rather than being managed by the Ministry of Defense (which is more appropriate), the OSA is managed under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Security Assistance Division.  \nHow Tokyo can sustain planned increases in its defence budget amid sluggish economic growth remains a big question going forward.  \nCurrently, the OSA scheme, at 2 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 2024, represents a lack of ambition financially. To put things in perspective, Japan was alreadytransferring maricreated_at assetsto Southeast Asian countries under its older ODA framework at far higher quantum values. \nJapan transferred ten patrol vessels to the Philippines for 12.7 billion yen (the ships were launched in 2016 and 2018). In 2020, Japan agreed to sell six Aso-class naval vessels to Vietnam for coast guard operations, for 36.6 billion yen. \nHow Tokyo can sustain planned increases in its defence budget amid sluggish economic growth remains a big question going forward.  \nLike the US, Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade (ARDB)deployments would also serve as a deterrent against China.  \nEnhancing SEA partners' capabilities and facilities \nOn the bright side, a little-known aspect of OSA might actually deliver some real capabilities to Southeast Asia — particularly for the programme's first beneficiary, the Philippines — as the region grapples with China's assertiveness in the South China Sea. The OSA allows Japan to help partner countries develop dual-use airports and seaports. This would promote visits by naval ships and aircraft of the JSDF. \nAccording to Ippeita Niishida, a senior fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation, thecontextfor this has been set. In February last year, Japan and the Philippines signed an agreement allowing the JSDF to access locations in the Philippines for use during humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations. \nThis is similar to the US, which signed an Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with Manila in 2014. While EDCA allows US forces to operate from EDCA locations in a HADR role, it would also allow for the patrol and monitoring of areas around the Philippines, and serve as a deterrent against China. \nThe same could apply to Japan. Niishida adds that under the 2023 deal between Tokyo and Manila, the JSDF's Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade (ARDB), which is styled after the US Marine Corps, could use Philippine facilities as launch points for HADR activities. Like the US, ARDB deployments would also serve as a deterrent against China. \nIt was nearly 20 years ago that Japan sent 950 troops to Aceh to help victims of the 2004 tsunami — Japan'sbiggest deploymentsince the Second World War. The deployment of ARDB units to the Philippines — if realised — would be historic, and proof that Japan could indeed play a proactive role in contributing to regional stability. \nThis article was first published inFulcrum, ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute's blogsite. \nRelated:What removing the defence budget cap means for Japan's role in the Indo-Pacific|Japan's weapons transfers to Southeast Asia: Opportunities and challenges|Japan's move towards acquisition of strike capabilities could benefit Southeast Asia\n"

    "text": "\nLast week, former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott delivered a speech in London in which he claimed to hear \"war drums beating again\". Quoting Winston Churchill, he exhorted the West to rediscover its \"moral health and martial vigour\".\nThese were the very words Churchill uttered soon after the disastrous Munich agreement of September 1938 when, according to the conventional wisdom, Hitler could have been stopped and world war avoided if only Western nations had stood up to the Nazi dictator on Czechoslovakia.\nAbbott's speech is only the latest example of a more widespread tendency among Western leaders, officials and commentators to see an \"axis of dictators\" forming in Russia, China and Iran, who are all set to plunge the globe into world war three.\nIt is the surest sign yet that the neo-conservative right across the West is getting more desperate, and therefore more shrill. They all want their own Churchillian moment.\nIn these dire auguries of the near future, Russia will conquer and occupy all of Ukraine, before Vladimir Putin sets his sights on the Baltics and Central Europe.\nIran will acquire nuclear weapons, foment more turmoil in the Middle East via its various proxies, and destroy Israel.\nAnd Xi Jinping will run out of patience, seize the opportunity of a West distracted elsewhere, and invade Taiwan.\nAs one prominent Australian commentator, Alan Dupont, puts it, \"China, Russia, North Korea [and] Iran ... are united in their desire to overturn the existing international order.\"\nMeanwhile, distinguished historian Niall Ferguson recently posed the prospect of the leaders of those nations meeting in Beijing \"to announce the formation of the Greater Eurasian Co-Prosperity Sphere\".\nAfter the death of three American troops in Jordan last month, Donald Trump also joined the fray, saying the world is \"on the brink of world war three\".\nHis target was President Joe Biden, but Bloomberg reports that news stories about world war three are \"at their highest in 16 months\" with \"talk of another global conflagration ... at its highest in a decade\".\nThis uptick in war talk derives largely from the resilience of neoconservative influences on American foreign policy, despite them being discredited in the wake of strategic debacles in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nKelley Beaucar Vlahos, a senior Director at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, recently wrote that \"neoconservatives and their aspirations are still at the very centre of today's foreign policy debates, and they really, really want the US to go to war in Iran\".\nVlahos readily acknowledges the meddling role Iran has played in funding proxies that have challenged the remaining US presence in Iraq and Syria, and that it funds Hamas. But she wants the American public to \"put the voices for war with Iran into perspective and not allow them to inflate the threat for their own agenda, which far predates the current crisis and for which motivations are less clearly in the US national interest\".\nClaims about the coming Armageddon often conflate today's circumstances with the 1930s and the Cold War. And it is these two periods that have become a kind of emotional and intellectual straitjacket on how the present strategic picture is being interpreted and presented to the public.\nThe worry is that their grip on the historical imagination narrows a broader suite of policy options for dealing with genuine threats.\nThese might involve negotiations and diplomacy, coexistence with societies the West cannot change, the integration of economics with security and the need, somecreated_ats, for trade-offs that don't concede fundamental national interests.\nInstead, the \"effects of Cold War myopia\", writes scholar Justin Winokur in Foreign Affairs, \"prime Americans to perceive the world through the eyes of a dominant, uncompromising United States after Pearl Harbour\".\nBut he warns that \"the United States is not about to reprise that era, and Americans steeped in the Cold War [are] unequipped for the emerging multipolar world\".\nThe narrative is not confined to America alone. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, for instance, in pressing the US Congress to continue funding the Ukrainian war effort, implored American lawmakers not to exhibit \"the weakness displayed against Hitler\". And he added that Hitler \"came back for more, costing us far more lives to cost his aggression\".\nThat received a swift rhetorical middle finger from Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green - namely that Cameron could \"kiss [her] ass\".\nBut Cameron was only following a grim warning from his colleague, Defence Minister Grant Shapps, who said in late January that the world had moved \"from a postwar world to a prewar world\".\nThese predictions, however alarmist, should not be summarily dismissed.\nChina's form in power projection and intimidation in the South China Sea has been manifest for well over a decade, and if it continues to convert its economic power into military might, Beijing poses a serious threat to the regional status quo.\nPutin illegally invaded Ukraine and Iran has become expert at niggling, pushing its own population and its geopolitical competitors to the brink, so far with few lasting bad consequences for the mullahs.\nNevertheless, two essential problems arise from this emerging consensus about a coming global military storm.\nThe first is what it means in assessing the true strengths and weaknesses of these revisionist powers.\nThe second is what such fears and phobias reveal about the current psychology of the West; about the perceived weakness of its will and growing concerns in many Western societies, including Australia, over a parlous state of war readiness.\nWhile there is a danger in underestimating the strengths of these powers, flush as they are with a nationalism based on centuries of grievance and form in assertion or aggression, there is also a great danger in overestimating their power and capacity.\nAmerican neo-conservatives and liberal hawks are all sounding the alarm, but the moment should be put in its proper context.\nIt is not clear, for instance, whether a China in the midst of trying to deal with a number of economic and demographic challenges simultaneously would choose this moment to forcefully retake Taiwan.\nHowever much Xi eyes weakening US and European resolve on funding Ukraine, he knows that no Chinese leader would survive any unsuccessful attempt to reunite Taiwan with the People's Republic.\nAnd President Biden is the last person to want to end up in a war in the Middle East. Indeed his entire policy since the October 7 attacks on Israel, much to the chagrin of many in the American debate, has been to avoid a wider conflagration.\nIt is true that Tehran has rarely had more irons in more regional fires than it does now, but it doesn't want to be directly involved in a broader conflict either. In addition, its regime is increasingly unpopular as its economy continues to founder.\nThe worry is that due to decades of sanctions, Iran feels like it has nothing to lose. But for the created_at being, it is probably content to keep pushing the US as a means of winning support from Russia and China.\nSpecifically, it wants those countries to not react if it detonates a nuclear weapon, thus making any entry to the nuclear club that much smoother.\nHowever, it's hard to see any hot war on Iranian territory, or in any other of the regional powers. The actual fighting will probably continue to be done by Iranian proxies such as Hezbollah and Houthi rebels.\nAs for Putin's wider ambitions, it is surely problematic to suggest that Russia, with its depleted military still knee-deep among alligators in the Donbas, is bent on further expansion to recreate the old Soviet empire.\nThe projections of imminent war say much, too, about what is becoming a pervasive sense of Western malaise - especially about the West's ability to summon forth the same kind of mobilised communities as in world wars I and II.\nIt also plays into wider concerns that a returned Trump will usher in a new era of US isolationism, at a created_at when Western militaries are struggling to achieve the kind of preparedness they deem appropriate for deteriorating strategic circumstances.\nFalling recruitment numbers, diminishing weapons stocks, dysfunctional defence industry and bureaucratic systems, and vast projects lagging behind schedule are creating their own perfect storm.\nThe rhetoric of deterrence is not being matched with genuine military credibility. And as Iraq and Afghanistan showed, there are limits on US influence and power in a more multipolar world that does not conform to Western expectations.\nTwo eminent Australian foreign policy thinkers did offer potent warnings about this kind of crude historical analogising.\nIn 2005, Owen Harries, founding editor of The National Interest, challenged the analogy between taking on the jihadist threat and the Cold War, saying that \"it is to belittle the historical experiences of World War II, not to mention the Cold War, to equate the terrorists of today and the damage they are capable of doing, with totalitarian regimes of the previous century\".\nSome years before, Australian historian Neville Meaney cautioned that \"if history repeats itself it never does so exactly ... Though similar circumstances recur again and again, each circumstance is unique.\"\nTheir advice might be summarised this way: that prophecy has always been for charlatans.P\n"

    "text": "\nUS Joint Forces should employ machine learning to better anticipate threats in the Pacific amid China's activities in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, according to a senior American commander in the region. \nAdmiral Samuel Paparo described US difficulties picking up on military warnings in his remarks to Silicon Valley executives on Tuesday at an event hosted by the Defence Innovation Unit, a Pentagon group created to hasten the use of cutting-edge technologies.  \nPaparo said the past three years had been marked by an \"erosion of strategic, operational and tactical\" warnings, noting China's military had experienced significant changes in its force levels and preparations. \nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) was \"raising the threshold of warning\" to a point that soon the US would see \"a force sufficient to execute a profound military operation\" in the field \"operating under a fig leaf of exercise\", the US Navy admiral added. \nOther regional challenges included North Korea's military provocation, Russia's maricreated_at ambitions in the Pacific, and the two countries' weapons trade, he said. \nWhile the Joint Forces have increasingly partnered with US allies, Paparo said \"mass data analytics and processing\" as well as the evaluation and dissemination of intelligence products should \"go deeper to be able to determine\" warnings. \nData analytics, for instance, could improve the American forces' ability to forecast the intentions of competitors and \"be prepared for aggression\". \nPaparo said the challenge amounted to \"what application can execute the mass data analytics and the precise covariance calculations that deliver a true, accurate picture to the war fighter [instantaneously] ... with a low probability of intercept and with the kind of encryption that ensures that it's secure\". \nUS military leaders have watched developments in the Pacific with mounting interest as Beijing has stepped up military drills and bolstered its presence in the South China Sea and the waters near Taiwan. \nPaparo said the developments represented China's \"undaunted ambitions for its excessive claims or their desire to coerce, if not effect through the use of force\". \nThe PLA regularly sends fighter jets, drones, and warships near Taiwan, with the island's defence ministry saying China deployed surveillance balloons ahead of its presidential election last month. \nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons. \nUS President Joe Biden has said American forces would defend Taiwan in the event of a mainland China attack - an assertion Beijing has denounced. \nMeanwhile, President Xi Jinping has called on the US to stop arming Taiwan, calling the island the \"most dangerous\" issue in the Sino-American relationship. \nWashington has also repeatedly condemned Chinese military moves in the South China Sea. \nBeijing claims sovereignty against neighbouring countries over the contested waters that fall within what it calls the nine-dash line. Tensions between China and the Philippines have intensified in recent months, with frequent stand-offs taking place near Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal, territories that both and other countries claim as their own.\n"

    "text": "\n During the state visit of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to the Philippines last November where he delivered a speech before a joint session of Congress, he highlighted the trilateral cooperation between the United States, the Philippines and Japan to protect the freedom of the South China Sea.\n'In order to maintain and strengthen a free and open international order based on the rule of law, multi-layered cooperation among allies and like-minded countries is crucial,' Prime Minister Kishida underscored, outlining efforts to 'protect the maricreated_at order, which is governed by laws and rules, not by force.'\nIn the most recent briefing paper issued by a good friend of mine and our embassy, director of the Southeast Asia Program and the Asia Maricreated_at Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Greg Poling with research associate Japhet Quitzon titled 'Sustaining the US-Philippines-Japan Triad,' China's 'aggression in the South China Sea and increasingly aggressive posture toward Taiwan' was highlighted as it continues to 'pose a threat to the rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific region.'\nThe brief delved on how the triad can better coordinate on a range of issues that include 'Beijing's illegal behavior in the East and South China Seas and possible Taiwan contingencies.'\nExhorting the US, Japan and the Philippines to 'urgently strengthen their partnerships with each other, reinforce the importance of cooperation and assess the role their alliances can play in ensuring regional security,' the brief provided a keen and clear-sighted assessment of the shared challenges, areas of cooperation as well as vulnerabilities that have to be addressed not only in terms of defense and security but economic as well.\n'In the face of shared challenges, Japan has become an important security partner to the Philippines,' the document noted, giving attention to a 'reciprocal access agreement' (RAA) between Japan and the Philippines which President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had described as 'extremely significant,' saying it will bring 'greater capacity to maintain peace in the South China Sea' and will also provide 'greater capability in terms not only of security, but also in terms of disaster preparedness.'\nAccording to Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro, Japan and the Philippines are fast-tracking the RAA (which is similar to the Visiting forces Agreement between the Philippines and the United States) that will lay the groundwork for bigger military exercises between Japanese and Philippine troops and would also allow Japanese military personnel access to the Philippines for training and support.\n'Crucially, the three partners should also have economic plans in place, including supportive measures to help sustain the triad's economies, especially the Philippines' shock-sensitive economy,' the brief said, noting that as an archipelagic state, 'the Philippines is exceedingly vulnerable to external shocks - any disruptions in the country's energy and supply chains would not only complicate everyday function within the country but impact the ability of both the Philippines and the United States to conduct security operations from the country.'\nConsidering the vulnerability of the Philippines to energy and supply chain shocks, Greg says the US and its allies should ensure that the Philippine economy remains robust. The US should deepen its economic relationship with the Philippines and 'do more to encourage US investors to take a serious look at the increasingly open Philippine economy, including by lifting travel advisories to Davao and other safe areas of Mindanao, and encourage the development of local manufacturers and industries, supporting the Philippines' domestic ability to pursue its national security aims,' the recommendation went.\nOur economic team at the Philippine embassy in Washington, DC has been actively engaging with key US officials and various business groups to explore areas of economic cooperation and bring focus to key sectors such as agriculture and clean energy, among many others. In Washington, we regularly interact with the Japanese ambassador.\nAside from aiding the Philippines in exploring more reliable energy options, the US and Japan are providing support to the Philippines in modernizing our armed forces.\n'Though military aid is crucial, the United States and Japan should also assist the Philippines in growing homegrown defense industries, aiming to provide jobs and increase the country's capacity for homegrown self-defense. The Philippines currently has very few domestic defense manufacturers,' the briefing paper underscored.\nAnother key finding highlighted in the brief are disinformation and misinformation operations that are proving to be among the greatest challenges facing allied cooperation in the region. Particularly worrying are the 'disinformation and pro-China narratives circulating on Philippine airwaves and cyberspace' that 'exacerbate the issue and threaten to disrupt a national effort to prepare the country against a contingency in the South China Sea. These information operations promoting pro-China content are rampant throughout cyberspace, downplaying aggressive Chinese behavior and placing the blame instead on the United States or even the Philippine Coast Guard.'\nTo counter such disinformation, the triad should create 'a unified front through harmonized messaging and coordinated anti-disinformation campaigns,' the paper pointed out, as this 'limits China's ability to wedge the triad apart. Countering Chinese disinformation in all three countries with credible, accessible and fact-based reporting will help delegitimize Chinese narratives aimed at dividing public opinion.'\nLike others in our government, I have been occasionally targeted by a smear campaign through fake memos, spurious emails and absurd messages from bogus senders, obviously in an attempt to picture me as a US paid hand.\nI have only one message to these agents of disinformation: The relationship between the US and the Philippines has never been better, and I will vigorously continue working to help ensure that our alliance remains solid, strong and stable.\n"

    "text": "\nKUALA LUMPUR  Indonesian Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto's ascension to the presidency could see Asean's largest member reclaim a leading role in the regional bloc after the Joko Widodo years, during which foreign policy was low on the list of priorities, observers say.\n Although the \"Jokowi effect\" of the charismatic Mr Widodo -- the first president not to hail from the country's military or political elite -- gained him wide global recognition, he largely left foreign affairs to members of his administration, stepping up only recently when Indonesia chaired the Group of 20 in 2022 and Asean in 2023.\n Analysts expect Mr Prabowo, a former general with deep links to neighbours and superpowers farther afield, to take a more active personal role in diplomacy, especially after campaigning on an \"Indonesia First\" pledge to ensure that the interests of the country's 280 million citizens are not undermined by foreign powers.\n \"As defence minister, Prabowo was known for advocating a more balanced foreign policy and seeking partnerships with multiple nations, including Asian powers. As a presidential candidate, he cited the need for strong maricreated_at defence capacity to maintain Indonesia's interests,\" Mr Leigh Howard, chief executive of consultancy Asialink Business in Melbourne, told The Sunday created_ats.\n South-east Asian policymakers may also be comforted by Mr Prabowo's commitment to continuity -- signified by having Mr Widodo's son as his running mate in the election -- with a stable and prosperous Indonesia being seen in diplomatic circles as a boon for all. \n But some also see potential for Indonesia to drive strongly towards Asean centrality, and focus more closely on the South-east Asian bloc's longstanding issues, such as disputes with China on overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea and the humanitarian crisis under Myanmar's junta.\n Mr Andreyka Natalegawa, an associate fellow at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said: \"The fact that the Jokowi administration has largely shied away from Indonesia's traditional role as a leader in Asean has exacerbated the organisation's strategic drift. \n \"Prabowo thus has the opportunity to steer Indonesia towards a more forward-leaning and active role in Asean, and restore the institution's relevance and centrality. But all this depends on whether he has the patience to work through Asean's admittedly languid decision-making and institutional processes.\"\n He added that \"Prabowo may place a higher priority on maricreated_at security and the assertion of Indonesia's rights in the South China Sea, including by supporting some efforts at coordination among South-east Asian claimants\".\n This would build on ground laid by President Widodo during a visit to Manila in January, when he and his Filipino counterpart Ferdinand Marcos Jr agreed to beef up defence ties and existing pacts on border cooperation after \"fruitful\" discussions on the South China Sea and cooperation within Asean. \n Mr Howard also pointed out that Mr Prabowo's leadership role in Asean and globally will hinge on his ability to build consensus with his peers in the region, his priorities on international issues, and the foreign policy team he installs in government. \n Thus, a key watch point will be the composition of the Prabowo Cabinet, and which of the existing foreign affairs officials will be retained. \n A top diplomat noted that Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi had been \"very active\" in Mr Widodo's stead, and said \"Indonesia was somecreated_ats a bit too pushy\" -- in stark contrast to the perception that foreign policy was not a top priority of the President.\n Ms Retno oversaw over 60 engagements related to the Myanmar crisis in the first half of 2023 alone, as part of Indonesia's \"non-megaphone diplomacy\" during its Asean chairmanship. \n But while her energy is noted in the diplomatic corps, her \"values-oriented approach that sidelined the junta... hasn't been effective in convincing Myanmar's military to be more open to foreign observers nor to a more benign political regime\", Vriens & Partners' Indonesia country director Donna Priadi told The Sunday created_ats.\n Perhaps a stronger indicator of Jakarta's leanings will be whether Coordinating Minister for Maricreated_at and Investment Affairs Luhut Panjaitan will continue in his \"problem-solver\" role. He has served as Mr Widodo's point man on key issues such as the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines and pandemic recovery, securing investment for the proposed new capital Nusantara in the jungles of Kalimantan, and managing relations with both Washington and Beijing amid rising Chinese investment.\n Much will also depend on how Mr Prabowo balances Indonesia's interests against those of Asean as a whole.\n Mr Howard noted that \"reclaiming Indonesia's lead role in Asean would be a useful vehicle for enhancing Prabowo's foreign policy profile. However, he may also determine that Indonesia possesses sufficient weight to achieve this objective independently\". \n"

Gunnery shoots on aerial and surface targets, manoeuvers and underway replenishment would also be conducted.\n\"MILAN would be an excellent platform for the participating navies to share ideas to enhance security on the high seas and ensure safety of maricreated_at commerce for growth and prosperity of all. In addition to building bridges of friendship and strengthening of relationship, Sea exercise would enhance interoperability, enable exchange of best practices and will boost confidence to undertake missions together in the future, to tackle common challenges,\" the release added.\nTo show its support, India, for the first created_at, explicitly called for adherence not only to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) but also to the 2016 Arbitral Award in the Joint Statement issued in June 2023. On the other hand, the United States has strengthened its relations with Vietnam and the Philippines.\nThe United States and Vietnam elevated their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership on 10 September 2023.\nThis strengthened position with the United States and India by the Philippines and Vietnam could make China even more wary.\nWith the increasing tension in the South China Sea between the Philippines and China in the Second Thomas Shoal beginning of this year, there is a high chance of de-escalation.\nThe Philippines' Coast Guard (PCG) has accused China of \"dangerous and blocking\" manoeuvres while its vessel patrolled near Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea.\nBy actively engaging in events like MILAN, countries can strengthen their ties and build trust, which are essential for maintaining peace and security.\nInformation Sharing: MILAN provides a platform for sharing maricreated_at security information, intelligence, and best practices. Full participation from ASEAN countries allows for a comprehensive exchange of information regarding common security threats such as piracy, terrorism, and illegal trafficking, thereby enhancing the collective ability to address these challenges effectively.\nCapacity Building: Participation in MILAN offers opportunities for capacity building in areas such as maricreated_at law enforcement, search and rescue operations, and disaster response. By engaging in exercises and workshops during the event, ASEAN countries can improve their capabilities and readiness to respond to security threats in the maricreated_at domain.\n"

    "text": "\nOn February 17, 2024 local created_at, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the Munich Security Conference. He delivered a keynote speech during the \"Conversation with China\" session, stressing that China will be a force for stability in addressing hotspot issues.\nWang Yi said, China has worked to explore a Chinese way of addressing hotspot issues, one that advocates for non-interference in internal affairs and opposes imposing one's will on others; upholds impartiality and justice and opposes pursuing selfish interests; seeks political settlement and opposes using force; aims to address both the symptoms and the root causes and opposes myopia and one-sidedness. With China's active mediation, a historic reconciliation was reached between Saudi Arabia and Iran, setting off a \"wave of reconciliation\" across the Middle East. This is a living example of implementing the Global Security Initiative put forth by President Xi Jinping.\nThe recent escalation and spillover of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the ongoing tension in the Red Sea once again demonstrate that the question of Palestine is at the heart of the Middle East issue. Generations of the Palestinian people have been displaced, yet they have not achieved the establishment of a legitimate state. This is the longest-lasting injustice in our world. China has stood firm on the side of fairness and justice all along, vigorously working for an end to the conflict and for the protection of civilians. China pushed the UN Security Council to adopt the first resolution since the latest conflict broke out, and issued a position paper on the political settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. China calls for accelerated efforts in establishing an independent State of Palestine and a more broad-based and effective international peace conference to truly realize peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel.\nOn the Ukraine crisis, China has never given up on promoting peace or slackened its efforts to facilitate talks. President Xi Jinping had in-depth exchanges with world leaders including Russian and Ukrainian leaders, playing a constructive role in addressing the crisis. China also published its position paper on the matter, and its special envoy traveled intensively to mediate among different parties. Behind all this, there is only one goal that China hopes to achieve, that is, to build consensus for ending the conflict and pave the way for peace talks.\nChina has made tireless efforts for the political resolution of the Korean Peninsula issue. The most pressing task at the moment is to prevent a vicious cycle, address relevant party's reasonable security concerns, and deescalate and stabilize the situation. On Myanmar, China facilitated various parties of the country in signing a ceasefire agreement in the Chinese city of Kunming, firmly safeguarded peace and stability in northern Myanmar, and encouraged ASEAN to facilitate the proper settlement of the Myanmar issue without interfering in the country's internal affairs. China also actively supported Afghanistan in building an inclusive political framework and adopting moderate policies, to forestall the resurgence and spread of terrorism.\nWith a vast territory and over a dozen neighboring countries, China faces complex disputes left from history. On that, China has stayed committed to managing differences through consultation and resolving disputes through dialogue. China stands ready to work with ASEAN to accelerate consultations on a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, advance maricreated_at cooperation and joint development, and build the South China Sea into a sea of peace, cooperation and friendship.\n"

    "text": "\nBesides Antony Blinken, Dr Jaishankar held talks with his counterparts from several countries, including Canada’s Melanie Joly. He also had a casual interaction with China’s Wang YiAmid increasing concerns about the role of Iran in the Red Sea attacks and growing Chinese assertion in the maricreated_at realm, India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar held talks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Germany’s Munich that revolved around the fraught situation in West Asia, Ukraine and the Indo- Pacific.The two foreign ministers met on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on 17 February, Saturday, amid emerging points of contention in the India- US ties over the alleged role of an Indian agent in the foiled attempt to assassinate Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Concerns about China’s increasing assertion in disputed maricreated_at bodies such as the South China Sea figured prominently in discussions.In the tweets posted by Dr Jaishankar on X, he mentioned that the discussions focused on Ukraine, Indo- Pacific and the Middle East, that is West Asia. According to US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, Secretary Blinken and External Affairs Minister Jaishankar discussed the need to ensure freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. \n“Secretary Blinken highlighted that the respective U.S. and Indian approaches to maricreated_at security in the Red Sea are mutually reinforcing and play important roles in safeguarding economic stability in the region.”The two also discussed ongoing work to ensure lasting peace and security in the Middle East, he added. “We’re working closely on a whole host of vital priorities that are making a difference in the lives of people in India and people in the United States: increasing mutual prosperity, advancing democracy and human rights, addressing climate change, upholding together the rules-based international order,” the US State Department quoted Blinken as saying further.The discussions on the Red Sea between the foreign ministers of India and the United States have an added importance in the context of the escalation in attacks on commercial ships by Iranbacked Houthi rebels. The discussion took place a day after a Panamanian-flagged tanker carrying crude oil bound for India was struck with a missile in the Red Sea. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis have warned that they will continue with attacks on Red Sea shipping in solidarity with the Palestinians, as long as Israel continues to commit “crimes” against them.The attacks on ships have disrupted global commerce and exacerbated concerns about the Israel-Hamas war. The Red Sea shipping route accounts for 50% of India’s exports and 30% of imports last fiscal. Domestic companies use the Red Sea route through the Suez Canal to trade with Europe, North America, North Africa and part of the Middle East. India, the world’s third-biggest oil importer, gets a bulk of its Russian supplies through the Red Sea.Besides one-on-one talks, Dr Jaishankar and Mr Blinken also shared the stage during a panel discussion entitled, “Growing the Pie: Seizing Shared Opportunities”. The discussions stressed on enhancing collaboration in shaping a more inclusive world order in the context of the emergence of the Global South.In a separate session organized by the Observer Research Foundation, Dr Jaishankar underscored the increasingly pivotal role of India as “Vishwa Mitra” (friend to the world) and in putting interests and aspirations of the Global South on the international agenda. Batting for a multipolar and inclusive world order, Jaishankar said that the world has moved on from unipolar to its natural diversity in the wake of the emergence of multiple centres of power.China FocusDr Jaishankar had a casual interaction with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in between the sessions at the Munich Security Conference. The two foreign ministers, however, did not hold bilateral talks as India-China relations continue to be in a deep freeze nearly three years after deadly clashes between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh. Chinese policies and postures, especially regarding freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, were dissected at different panel discussions in the Munich Security Conference.In his keynote address on “China in the World,” Wang Yi warned the West that it would be making a historical mistake if it sought to decouple from China in the interests of reducing risk. “Whoever tries de-Sinicization in the name of de-risking would be making a historical mistake,” Wang said. His comments were scrutinized closely as the United States and the European Union have called publicly to reduce their dependence on China.Lose-Lose WorldBesides Blinken, Dr Jaishankar also held talks with his counterparts from several countries, including Canada’s Foreign Minister Melanie Joly, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Cameron, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and Greece’s Minister of National Defence Nikos Dendias. The three-day Munich Security Conference started on 16 February, Friday, with dozens of heads of state/ government and foreign ministers in attendance.The conference began with the scene-setting remarks by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, in which he stressed on the need for creating an inclusive and rules-based order. The global order is not working for anyone anymore, he said. In a speech at the Munich Security Conference, US Vice-President Kamala Harris underscored the US’ commitment to global leadership amid growing concerns in Europe about the US turning isolationist under a potential Trump presidency.In a sign of shifting geopolitical plates, “migration through war and climate change” has now surpassed the Ukraine war as a top trigger of anxiety in the world, says a report unveiled at the Munich Security Conference, the largest foreign policy and strategy conference in Europe. The world in 2024 will be characterized by a “downward trend in world politics, marked by an increase in geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty,” Christoph Heusgen, chairman of the Munich Security Conference (MSC), says in the conference’s 2024 security report, entitled “Lose- Lose.”\n"

    "text": "\nchinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2024-02-18 19:13\nThe series of provocations Manila has orchestrated in waters adjacent to China's Huangyan Island in the South China Sea over the past Chinese Lunar New Year holiday only serve to further erode Beijing's trust in Manila's sincerity in its recent assertion that it wanted to work together with China to secure a political settlement of the two countries' maricreated_at disputes.\nIn its latest move calculated to ruin Beijing's festive mood, the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources vessel 3005 illegally intruded into the adjacent waters of Huangyan Island, ignoring repeated warnings from the China Coast Guard. The CCG implemented measures in accordance with the law to compel the vessel to leave the area.\nThis is not the first created_at that the Chinese side had to expel Philippine vessels that illegally intruded into waters adjacent to the island in recent days. The CCG has had to respond to a Philippine Coast Guard vessel illegally intruding into the waters on multiple occasions from Feb 2 to 9. China holds indisputable sovereignty over Huangyan Island and its adjacent waters, and the CCG's actions are legitimate activities to enforce the law in China's jurisdictional waters.\nWere it not for the professionalism and restraint of the Chinese side, Manila's provocative moves might have easily escalated into skirmishes and even open conflict. Something Beijing is carefully trying to avoid but which Manila seems to covet, no doubt in the belief, however misplaced, that it has Washington's backing.\nAlthough escalated tensions do not serve the interests of any regional country, including those of the Philippines, open conflict between China and the Philippines, in the eyes of Washington would serve the US' agenda of derailing China's development.\nThe joint statement released by Beijing and Manila during President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's visit to Beijing one year ago, and the series of cooperation projects the two sides have carried out ever since, clearly highlight the tremendous benefits the Philippines can draw from cooperation with China. Manila should take a more rational view of the US' intentions, as it only regards the Philippines as a useful piece on the board in its geopolitical game with China.\nThanks to the tacit consensus between China and the Philippines, their maricreated_at disputes have been shelved for decades in favor of win-win cooperation. It is the US that has sought to sabotage this consensus. That's why Beijing has always exercised patience toward Manila, despite its provocations.\nThe Marcos government cites \"security concerns\" to justify its leveraging the US' desire to militarize the region as \"security\" for its breaking and entering activities. But barking dogs that bark for the sake of straining the leash are nothing but a nuisance.\n"

    "text": "\nMike Glynn is a retired Qantas pilot\nHe believes the pilot of MH370 could have depressurised the cabin\nREAD MORE: Why we may never know what happened to the MH370\nA retired Qantas pilot has opened up on what may have happened during the mysterious MH370 flight that disappeared almost 10 years ago.\nMalaysian Airlines Flight MH370 vanished over the South China Sea during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China, on March 8, 2014.\nThe puzzling case made titles across the world as it seemed the plane, which carried 239 people - including six Australians, disappeared without a trace.\nJust one week after the plane was downed, then-Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak claimed there was a 'high degree of certainty' communications with MH370's cockpit were deliberately cut.\nOne popular theory is the crash was a murder-suicide at the hands of captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, but it has never been confirmed by authorities.\n READ MORE: Aussie fisherman claims he pulled MH370 plane wing from the ocean\nRetired Qantas pilot and RAAF training captain Mike Glynn appeared on Sky News Australia's new documentary - MH370: Ten Years On, set to premiere at 7.30pm AEDT on Tuesday.\nHe said there were several ways someone inside the cockpit could have incapacitated passengers. \nThere's a chance they could have been on the verge of death without knowing anything was wrong.\nMr Glynn told Sky someone inside the cockpit could have easily locked its door and forced the plane into a confused state by depressurising the cabin.\n'[They'd] make sure the door's locked, so no one can get in. Nothing that anyone could do,' he said.\n'When you open these outflow valves, the aircraft depressurises very quickly,' he said.\n'If the aircraft's not going to descend, you'll start to feel very hypoxic within three or four minutes.'\nHypoxia occurs when the text does not receive enough oxygen, which can lead to confusion and a rapid heart rate before the patient loses consciousness.\nMr Glynn added it would have been easy for someone inside the cockpit to keep other people out as locking doors were introduced after the 9/11 plane hijackings.\n'The door will automatically close, and you can lock it by this switch,' he said.\n'And you can also, there's a manual deadbolt that prohibits any sort of entry into the flight deck. You can have a full on attack on the door, it's not going to change a thing.'\nThe wreckage of MH370 has still not been found almost a decade later despite its disappearance triggering the largest ever air-sea multinational search.\nHowever, an Australian fisherman Kit Olver, 77, claimed last year his trawler pulled up what appeared to be the wing of a commercial airliner in late, 2014.\nHe claims was fishing some 55km off the southeast coast of South Australia, in the Southern Ocean, when his net snagged on something large.\n 'It was a bloody great wing of a big jet airliner,' Mr Olver said.\n'I've questioned myself. I've looked for a way out of this.\n'I wish to Christ I'd never seen the thing... but there it is. It was a jet's wing.'\nAs he had held a pilot's licence, Mr Olver was confident the wing was larger than any on a typical private plane.\nHis discovery was backed-up by Peter Waring - whose expertise in surveying sea floors led to his involvement in the search for MH370.\nMr Waring said it was 'plausible' for debris from the wreckage to be found in southern Australia, considering more than 20 pieces of possible debris have been discovered in Africa.\nHowever, the latest theories and discoveries would be of little comfort to the victims' families who may never have answers of what happened to their loved ones.\nBritish aerospace engineer Richard Godfrey last month accused the Malaysian Government of abandoning its search for MH370.\nHe claims the government did not want to invest any more funding into the mission, despite several calls from victims' families to relaunch search efforts last year.\n'In my view, the Malaysian government does not want the cause of the crash of MH370 to be known,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n'It does not help to speculate what the motives of the Malaysian Government might be with regard to MH370.' \n"

It is not easy for a country of 125 million to take on a country of 1.4 billion, a rising power with nuclear weapons,\" Powell, a former defense attaché of the US government to Vietnam and Australia, recently told The Manila created_ats.\n\"That's not easy; that takes what we call intestinal fortitude. It takes guts, and I've certainly been impressed with the Marcos administration and its willingness to risk escalation for the sake of asserting its (the Philippines') sovereignty,\" he added.\nIn a Saturday news forum in Quezon City, PCG spokesman for WPS Jay Tarriela dismissed comments that the Philippines was provoking China or escalating tension in the WPS with the rotational deployment of vessels by the PCG and Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) in Bajo de Masinloc or the Scarborough Shoal where Chinese ships were reported to have driven away Filipino fishermen. This has since been denied by the government.\n\"You know, their presence, with or without the government vessels' rotational deployment of PCG and BFAR vessels in Bajo de Masinloc, they were there,\" Tarriela told reporters.\n\"Our objective here is not to provoke anytext, not to escalate the tension in Bajo de Masinloc. Our objective here is to protect the Filipino fishermen, to make sure the Filipino fishermen will be able to fish in Bajo de Masinloc,\" he added.\nTarriela said that the guidance of the President is very clear - \"to have a rational deployment between the Philippine Coast Guard and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources to maintain our presence in Bajo de Masinloc.\"\nHe said the PCG had maintained its presence in Philippine waters from February 1 to 9 while the BFAR deployed its personnel after their shift in the rotational deployment. \nTarriela also said the BFAR had deployed its BRP Datu Tamblot, or the MMOV-3005 and the Cessna Caravan, the RP-1077, and the Cessna 208-B and its aircraft that came from Clark, Pampanga. \n\"The guidance of the President has been very clear. The rotational deployment will be here to stay between the Philippine Coast Guard and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources,\" the PCG official said.\n\"The objective of which is also related to the first question - for the food security, to make sure that we're going to protect the Filipino fishermen's rights and to ensure that the Filipino fishermen will go their fishing freely without any harassment,\" he added.\nDuring its latest patrol, Tarriela said the PCG continues to experience \"dangerous maricreated_at maneuvers\" from Chinese vessels in the WPS.\nHe said they had monitored four China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels and a People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy vessel. \nTarriela said the vessels identified as CCG 3063 and 3064 have been deployed in the area to make sure that the southeast entrance of Bajo de Masinloc is well-guarded by putting floating barriers every created_at they monitored Philippine vessels nearby. \nHe added that they monitored CCG 3302 and 3105, carrying out \"dangerous maneuvers\" to prevent the BFAR and PCG vessels from getting near Bajo de Masinloc.\nMeanwhile, BFAR said it has successfully provided assistance and provisions to Filipino fishermen in Bajo de Masinloc. \nDuring the same Saturday's new forum, BFAR spokesman Naz Briguera said the resupply mission of the BFAR and the PCG to Filipino fishermen in Bajo de Masinloc is aligned with the vision of the \"Bagong Pilipinas\" ensuring food security. \n\"It's not just about the volume of fisheries production, but it's about the importance of the West Philippine Sea in maintaining the integrity of our marine resources,\" Briguera said.\nAnother Chinese blockade in Ayungin\nMeanwhile, several Chinese vessels were seen blocking the Philippine ships on resupply missions to the BRP Sierra Madre.\nPowell said a China Coast Guard vessel with bow number 5203 and two Chinese maricreated_at militia (CMM) ships moved to block access to Ayungin as PCG ships BRP Cabra and Sindangan passed south of the shoal and nearby Mischief (Panganiban) Reef.\nThis latest blockade by China in Ayungin Shoal comes two days after the incident in Bajo de Masinloc, where the CCG claimed to have \"implemented measures to control the [Philippine] vessel's navigation and compel it to leave the area in accordance with law\" and that the situation was handled in a \"professional and standardized manner on-site.\"\n'Assertive transparency'\nPowell said the country's unceasing filing of diplomatic protests and publication of photos and reports of harassment incidents of the CCG and CMM are examples of the government's \"assertive transparency\" as this sheds light on what China has been doing in the shadows.\nHe cited the Feb. 6, 2023 incident at the Ayungin Shoal when a CCG ship used a military-grade laser to drive away a Philippine Coast Guard vessel.\nDocumentation of the incident made by the PCG was released, a move that Beijing obviously was displeased about as this garnered more international attention, which led to more support coming the way of the Philippines.\n\"The Philippines discovered something that it could use as leverage in the struggle,\" Powell said.\n\"The Philippines is obviously overmatched by the strength of the CCG and Chinese maricreated_at militia ships, but what it did have was essentially a moral high ground,\" he added.\nSaid \"braver\" front of the Philippines has certainly erased the \"false dichotomy\" presented by the past leadership of Rodrigo Duterte, who was perceived to have a \"pro-China\" policy, Powell asserted.\n\"I think President Duterte, in evaluating the situation in the West Philippine Sea, said, 'We don't want to go to war with China.' Well, notext says you have to go to war with China. What was made was a false dichotomy, a false choice - either submit or have peace or contest and have war,\" he said.\n\"But that's not the way it works. It's not like an on-and-off switch. There are many different ways you can approach it, and if submission is your only option, then all you'd find out is that your adversary will take advantage of you,\" he added.\nMarcos has reiterated numerous created_ats that the Philippines \"will not give up a single square inch of our territory to any foreign power\" and that under his watch, the country would fully and unrelentingly assert its sovereignty in adherence \"to the lawful exercise of rights under international law demonstrates the strength of the alliances.\"\n\"Supported by the rules-based international order and our growing partnerships, both created_at-tested and new ones, we will insist on the preservation of the sovereignty and integrity of the country while working closely with international partners in the bilateral, regional, and multilateral settings in developing rules and processes to address these challenges,\" the President said.\n"

    "text": "\nPrabowo Subianto's foreign and defense policies have come under the spotlight after the former army general and current defense minister claimed victory in Indonesia's presidential election this week.\nPrabowo won almost 60% of the votes, according to several polling agencies drawing attention to his policies amid rising tensions in the South China Sea and China-United States rivalry.\nIndonesia is not a party to the South China Sea dispute but it has a strategic and economic interest in maintaining peace and stability there as its exclusive economic zone overlaps with several neighboring countries, as well as with the so-called nine-dash line that Beijing uses to claim China's historic rights over most of the sea.\nThe South China Sea dispute has become one of Indonesia's most important security issues and it could also spark a major conflict between the United States and China, according to Aristyo Rizka Darmawan, a senior researcher at the Center for Sustainable Ocean Policy at the University of Indonesia.\nPrabowo's campaign documents state that Indonesia needs to prepare for future conflicts and plan how to reduce potential risks.\nPrabowo's narrative on the South China Sea has been more about how we [should] have a strong defense capacity, Darmawan told BenarNews, a news service affiliated with Radio Free Asia.\nMuhammad Zulfikar Rakhmat, a researcher at the National University of Singapore (NUS), said that the former general has had a history of advocating for a more assertive and independent foreign policy for Indonesia.\nHis victory in the election might lead to a recalibration of Indonesia's approach to the South China Sea issue and regional security, Zulfikar told RFA. Prabowo may prioritize strengthening Indonesia's military capabilities in the disputed waters.\nAristyo Rizka Darmawan said Prabowo would likely focus on building up the naval forces as a deterrent in the waters around the Natuna islands, where encroachments by Chinese fishing vessels and patrols have become regular.\n\"Defense and maricreated_at capabilities of the Indonesian navy are important. With such a strategy, Prabowo would most likely implement a more assertive policy in the North Natuna Sea,\" the senior researcher from the University of Indonesia said.\nStrategic continuity\nIndonesia is a founding member of ASEAN and under its chairmanship in 2023, the bloc and China embarked on a new round of draft agreement discussion for a Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea.\nHowever, Prabowo has not offered any new ideas for promoting dialogue or accelerating the COC negotiations, Darmawan said.\n\"Relying solely on military capabilities would not help much in maintaining peace and security in the contested waters. To show leadership in ASEAN, Indonesia should not only think of itself but also think of a bigger role in helping the region avoid escalation and conflict,\" he added.\nThe new president will take a middle-of-the-road position on the South China Sea dispute without offering anything new, according to Muradi, a military analyst and professor of political and security studies at Padjadjaran University.\nIt is clear that his politics will be more focused on domestic affairs. This is the characteristic of a soldier who was born and raised in the Cold War era,\" Muradi, who goes by one name, said.\nThe analyst warned that the situation in the South China Sea is evolving and so is the threat from China to ASEAN. China's military modernization is expected to be completed by 2027 and many predict that by then Beijing would be confident enough to wage an open conflict in the region and the U.S. would have to intervene to support its allies.\n\"This requires more fundamental steps, not just saying we need this or that but concrete actions, he said.\nZulfikar from the NUS, meanwhile, said Prabowo's stance on China and the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy may not be straightforward.\nWhile he has expressed interest in cultivating closer ties with China, particularly in terms of economic cooperation, Prabowo has also emphasized the importance of maintaining Indonesia's sovereignty and independence in its foreign policy, Zulfikar said.\nThat may see Prabowo seeking to enhance regional cooperation with ASEAN countries and other regional powers to address security challenges.\nPrabowo may adopt a pragmatic approach, seeking to balance Indonesia's relations with both China and the United States to maximize its own interests.\nRegarding the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy and AUKUS grouping [between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.], he may approach them cautiously, emphasizing Indonesia's non-alignment stance while exploring potential benefits and risks associated with increased engagement with these initiatives, the NUS researcher added.\nHuong Le Thu, Asia deputy director at the International Crisis Group said that she doesn't expect major changes in foreign policy as Prabowo takes over, not in the early days, at least.\nThe former general repeatedly promised to continue the domestic and foreign policies of his predecessor, the widely popular president Joko Widodo.\nAfter all, 'continuity' was among the main aspects of his campaign, she said, If anything, I would expect more of the old - and old old - than of the new.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "text": "\nManila is perceived to be slow to adopt submarine deterrence compared with neighbouring states, due to its focus on ground troopsDespite their cost, experts say even a few submarines will have an 'outsized effect' on the battlefield - with three being the 'magic number'\nThe Philippines should acquire at least three military submarines to ensure effective deterrence against China amid mounting maricreated_at tensions between both countries, analysts have said, after Manila confirmed it would start buying such vessels. \nWhile the numbers may be small compared to Beijing's, experts say these vessels play an \"outsized effect\" on the battlefield, as they can put other countries' surface warships at risk and even alter an adversary's naval strategy. \nManila is perceived to be slow to adopt submarine deterrence compared with other littoral states in Southeast Asia, due to its focus on ground troops. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nEarlier this month, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr approved the third phase of the military's modernisation, which includes the purchase of the country's first submarine, to defend its maricreated_at sovereignty in the disputed South China Sea. \nWhile Roy Trinidad, navy spokesman for the West Philippine Sea, did not say how many submarines Manila intended to acquire, he indicated that \"definitely more than one\" would be bought. \nIn recent months, tensions have risen between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, with forces on both sides engaging in numerous confrontations while officials traded accusations of sowing conflict. \nIan Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the Philippines would need to acquire at least three vessels if one submarine were to be operational at all created_ats. \n\"Three is the magic number,\" Storey said, adding that this applied to all types of military equipment, \"one in operation, one in training and one in refit or maintenance\". He noted that Vietnam, for instance, had six submarines, which ensured that at least two were operational at any created_at. \nBut since the Philippines has never operated submarines, Storey said the process of acquiring and integrating them would take at least a decade, as infrastructure would need to be built, including bases, piers, dry docks and other support services. \n\"Once delivered, it will take years of training and exercises for the Philippine Navy submariners to gain the operational experience necessary to proficiently use the boats,\" Storey said. \nIf the Philippine placed orders for two to three submarines, it would take \"at least\" until the mid-2030s before they can be effectively operated, he added. \nJoshua Bernard Espeña, vice-president at the International Development and Security Cooperation think tank in Manila, said two or three submarines would not be enough to deter China since the Southern Theatre Command - one of five People's Liberation Army commands - might have more than 30 diesel-electric submarines in the South China Sea. \nSo the Philippines would have to ensure its small fleet \"adds value\" and would be able to \"generate a strategic effect\" through integrating the country's combat management systems with its surface and naval aviation platforms. \nAgreeing that three was the \"ideal\" number, Felix Chang, senior fellow at the US-based Foreign Policy Research Institute think tank, said if Manila only had the one submarine, and a Chinese satellite detected it in port, \"then the Chinese navy knows the Philippines has no submarines at sea\". \n\"But if the Philippines has two submarines and a Chinese satellite detects one submarine in port, then the Chinese navy does not know where the second submarine is and must deploy a guard against it,\" Chang said. \nSubmarines have an \"outsized effect\" on the naval battlefield, as they can \"cost-effectively put an adversary's surface warships at risk\", he added. \n\"The mere existence of a small number of hard-to-detect submarines could alter how large numbers of surface warships operate,\" Chang said, adding that submarines are effective at sea denial, or preventing an adversary from controlling a certain sea space. \nIn the case of the Philippines, a few submarines, \"if stealthy\", could alter how China operates in the South China Sea, such as through the deployment of additional warships to defend against such submarines. \nIt might even require the Chinese navy to change its strategies in the region, Chang said, though this would not deter Beijing from challenging Manila's maricreated_at claims or stop its incursions into Philippine waters, especially if China uses its coastguard or maricreated_at militia vessels. \n\"But Philippine submarines would likely alter China's mindset that its maricreated_at forces can act with complete impunity in the waters disputed between Beijing and Manila,\" Chang said. \nIt would also \"compel Chinese maricreated_at forces to act with greater caution and think about the consequences of their actions in a way they had not needed to do in the past,\" Chang added. \nWhile other Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore already own submarines, the Philippines is late in acquiring the vessels. \nThis is partly due to Manila's history of internal struggle with communist and Islamic rebellions, which has long forced the authorities to focus its limited resources on the ground forces, said Benjamin Blandin, maricreated_at security expert and network coordinator at the Japan-based non-profit Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies. \nSubmarine acquisition was not a decision to take lightly, given the direct and indirect costs. \nApart from the cost of the vessels, the Philippines also needed funds for maintenance, weapon systems and ammunition, and training needed \"to turn these vessels into a credible deterrent\", Blandin said. \n\"These costs, unless the overall military budget were to grow accordingly, would certainly impact the Horizon Phase 3 target acquisitions for either or both of the ground forces and Air Force and even possibly the coastguards,\" Blandin said. \n\"The political and military authorities would have to make hard decisions,\" he said. \"Could the navy maintain its objective to grow its surface fleet while acquiring submarines, and for the coastguard to double in size by 2035? That is, in my view, a major question that remains to be clarified.\" \nHorizon 3 is the third phase of the Philippine military's 15-year modernisation plan. It includes the purchase of multirole fighter jets, radars, two more frigates of the Jose Rizal class, missile systems, helicopters and the nation's first submarine fleet. \nBlandin added that the final decision to select between the Spanish, Korean, Japanese and French options will be based on a choice between the best possible political, industrial and military alliance. \nAs Foreign Policy Research Institute's Chang noted, the submarine acquisition is likely to be the capstone to the Philippine navy's modernisation programme. \n\"It is a capability that the Philippine navy has long sought and is critical for all modern navies, due to the greater vulnerability of surface vessels to increasingly accurate anti-ship missiles,\" Chang said. \nCopyright (c) 2024.

    "text": "\nForeign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo on Thursday said there is no new directive to soften actions in asserting the country's sovereign rights over the West Philippine Sea (WPS).\nIn a media forum in Manila, the Filipino top diplomat said the Philippines has always and will maintain a policy to manage disputes diplomatically and peacefully while firmly defending its maricreated_at rights over the area.\nSo, our position has not changed, it remains the same. I think that's how we will proceed in whatever future discussions we have, he said.\nManalo said the government would also sustain a policy of transparency in the WPS, noting that the country's actions have been consistently hinged on international law.\nThe statement was in response to a question whether Manila will retain its so-called \"assertive transparency,\" which involves publicizing illegal and unilateral actions conducted within Philippine waters.\nThe Philippines' role as vanguard of the rule of law, particularly the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as the fundamental and only arbiter of the overlapping claims and disputes in the South China Sea, can be seen as an extension of Philippine good global citizenship as a peacemaker, rule-shaper and consensus-builder, as much as it is about Philippine territorial integrity and national sovereignty, he said.\nManalo said Manila's principled rules-based approach on the South China Sea/West Philippine Sea is also a reflection that Manila is championing nothing less, and nothing more, than what is just.\nWhen a state becomes a party to a Treaty, it is under a legal obligation to bring its laws and conduct into conformity with the Treaty, he said, referring to the UNCLOS.\nEfforts seeking to shape and use rules, going against international law, should be opposed or not accepted, he added.\nIn 2016, an Arbitral Tribunal issued a landmark award that invalidated China's expansive claims in the South China Sea.\nThe ruling was based on the UNCLOS, which both China and the Philippines are parties.\nLast Jan. 17, the two nations met for the 8th Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea (BCM) and discussed ways to de-escalate the situation in the South China Sea.\nBoth sides agreed to calmly deal with incidents, if any, through diplomacy.\nNot part of US-China rivalry\nIn the same forum, Manalo reiterated that the South China Sea disputes are not at all centered on the US-China rivalry.\nHe stressed that the region is composed of a number of nations and is not shaped by just one or two powers.\nSubscribing strictly to the prism of this rivalry does not help in an honest understanding of the situation. Firstly, it puts distinct and legitimate rights and interests of countries such as the Philippines aside, and secondary to the interests of the rivals, he said.\nSecondly, it purposely obscures good judgment: actions that are clearly illegal in international law and against the UN Charter are somecreated_ats rationalized under the pretext of this rivalry, he added. - PNA\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines is accusing Chinese fishermen of poisoning the ecosystem of the bountiful, but contested, fishing areas in the South China Sea.\n\"These Chinese fishermen use cyanide,\" Nazario Briguera, a spokesperson for the Southeast Asian country's fisheries bureau, said on Saturday, according to local media.\nThe Philippines and China have been at loggerheads over the Scarborough Shoal since a territorial spat in 2012 escalated to the point where China seized de facto control over the area. The shoal is situated within the Philippines' 200 nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which according to international maricreated_at law grants it the sole right to the natural resources found within.\nBriguera claimed Chinese fishing crews were deploying the toxic chemical to intentionally damage the shoal and discourage Philippine fishermen from operating in the area, which China claims as its own, as it does with most of the South China Sea.\nThis is a \"clear case of illegal, unreported and undocumented fishing,\" he said.\nChina operates the largest commercial fishing fleet in the world. These ships have been accused of plundering other countries' fish stocks, and China accounts for over half of the world's environmentally devastating bottom-trawling fishing fleets.\nHe estimated the alleged cyanide use may have already inflicted more than $17.8 million in damage, but added that the agency hasn't begun a formal investigation.\nIn an interview with the Philippines' GMA News over the weekend, Philippine spokesperson Jay Tarriela said: \"We do not have any scientific study or any evidence that would suggest that the cyanide fishing at Bajo de Masinloc can be attributed to the Chinese or even the Vietnamese fishermen.\"\nFishermen from China and Vietnam, like their Philippine counterparts, have long fished the shoal's resource-rich waters. However, China frequently expels Filipinos it finds there, prompting Manila to recently announce it was stepping up coast guard patrols to support its nationals.\nThe livelihoods of an estimated 385,000 people depend on their hauls in waters around the country's EEZ, according to government data from Manila.\nNewsweek reached out to the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Chinese foreign ministry with written requests for comment.\nDeveloped as a means of incapacitating live fish to collect for aquariums, cyanide is now frequently used—including by Philippine fisherfolk—to capture seafood.\n\"Cyanide fishing may not be as rampant as in the 1970s and 1980s, it is still being done in the Philippines,\" the Manila Bulletin cited fisheries expert Alan White as saying in an article published last year.\nIn September, the Philippines announced it would go forward with a lawsuit over \"innumerable and immeasurable damage\" allegedly wrought by Chinese fishermen harvesting coral within the Philippine EEZ.\nChina has countered with its own accusations of environmental malfeasance.\nChinese state-backed media outlet the Global created_ats ran an article last month accusing the Philippines of damaging the environment around another South China Sea feature, the Spratly Islands' Second Thomas Shoal, with the continued presence of a grounded 80-year-old warship that Manila uses to house marines there.\nA quarter century's worth of toxic metal and paint corrosion coupled with fossil fuel use and waste from those stationed there are causing \"irreversible and sustained damage to the surrounding marine life,\" the outlet cited Chinese marine strategy expert Yang Xiao as saying.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nFishing Boat Sails By Chinese Coast Guard\nTed Aljibe/AFP via Getty Images\nThis photo taken on February 15, 2024, shows a Chinese coast guard ship sailing past a Philippine fishing boat near the China-controlled Scarborough Shoal, in disputed waters of the South China Sea.

    "text": "\nNOT wanting a military confrontation with the United States, China will not dare to remove the dilapidated BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal and will instead wait for it to fall apart, a United States-based maricreated_at security analyst said.\nRetired US Col. Raymond Powell said China will not attempt to forcefully tow away the beached ship despite its repeated threats to do so.\nChina claims Ayungin or Ren'ai Jiao as part of Nansha Qundao or the Spratly Islands, which it controls.\n\"They could do it if they try. I don't think that they will try because the ... your BRP Sierra Madre is a commissioned ship of the Philippine Navy,\" said Powell.\nDeliberately grounded in 1999, the Sierra Madre serves as a \"constant Philippine government presence\" on Ayungin, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said. \nThe beaching of the derelict ship was in response to China's \"illegal occupation\" in 1995 of Panganiban or Mischief Reef, the DFA said.\nPowell said the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) states that an armed attack on the Philippines would automatically elicit an armed response from the US.\nArticle 4 of the MDT states that each signatory recognizes \"that an armed attack in the Pacific area on either of the parties would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common dangers in accordance with its constitutional processes.\"\nAn armed attack \"shall be immediately reported to the Security Council of the United Nations. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security,\" it further read.\nPowell said China does not \"want the Philippines to do anything that lengthens the created_at that the Sierra Madre stays intact on Ayungin Shoal,\" he said.\nAsked if the ship could become a flashpoint in the region, Powell said, \"I don't think that China is looking for a reason for the United States to get involved in a conflict, in direct conflict in the South China Sea.\"\n\"So, I think it will try to avoid that. China's perspective is that tomorrow, that ship starts to fall apart, the troops on board call for help, China comes in, rescues the troops, drags the ship off the shoal because it's a hazard. And then that's over,\" he said.\nIn the meancreated_at, China's plan is to \"just keep blockading the Shoal until the ship finally falls apart,\" Powell said.\nThe DFA in December 2023 filed a diplomatic protest against the China Coast Guard's use of water cannon against Philippine vessels on regular resupply missions to Filipino fishermen in Bajo de Masinloc (Scarborough Shoal) and soldiers stationed in BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal in the West Philippine Sea. \nChina filed counter-protests, insisting that the area where the rusting Sierra Madre lies is part of its territory. \nInfluence\nPowell said that China's economic influence in the region prevents some members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).\n\"China is very well known for using economic inducements on one hand [or] carrots and then threats or sticks on the other hand to sort of encourage nations or governments to go their way,\" the founder and director of SeaLight, a maricreated_at transparency project that monitors and reports activities in the South China Sea, said during a roundtable with The Manila created_ats on February 15.\n\"There was a famous quote by a Singaporean diplomat where he said people expect Asean to be a horse, but Asean is not a horse. It's a cow,\" said Powell. \"So you can't ask a cow to be a horse. Asean does some things well. Coming up with a strong stance on collective security is not one of those things,\" he said.\nPowell said Laos, a landlocked nation, \"is not interested in the South China Sea very much.\"\n\"If China does not want a particular stance to be taken, it's not hard for China to influence those discussions. So, I think it's a lot to ask Asean to be able to come in and take a strong stand on South China Sea issues,\" he said.\n\"I think that there are those who are trying very hard. I commend them for trying very hard,\" said Powell.\n"

    "text": "\nThe United States is reportedly considering deploying two more aircraft carriers to its ­western Pacific fleet, which already consists of three ­carriers. These potential deployments, along with recent naval exercises involving Japan and South Korea in the East China Sea and the expected visit of US senators to Taiwan this week, underline Washington's dedication to prioritising its strategic ­interests in the region. \nThis commitment persists even as the US remains involved in safeguarding ­commercial ships in the Red Sea amid ­tensions with Yemen's Houthis. These developments are happening on the back of a recent meeting between US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Bangkok, aimed at establishing guard rails on bilateral ties.  \nThe top issues that the Chinese readout of the meeting mentioned were Taiwan and Washington's alleged politicisation of ­economic issues for national security - in other words, restrictions on the export of advanced technology to China. \nThe security issue in the Middle East was mentioned tangentially with a ­reference to global and regional issues in places including Ukraine, Myanmar, the Korean peninsula and South China Sea. The statements from the two sides did not even refer to the Red Sea crisis or the recent killings of US soldiers in Jordan. \nThese interactions highlight the Middle East security issue is not a top agenda item for US-China talks, yet other reports suggest Washington has reached out to Beijing asking it to influence Iran in restraining its proxy militia activities in the region. \nIran-backed Houthis have been targeting commercial vessels in and around the Red Sea, disrupting maricreated_at trade and increasing shipping costs, including for China. In response, Beijing has criticised the harassment and attacks on civilian vessels, as well as the disruption of supply chains and the global trading regime, ­without specifying the responsible party. \nThere is no evidence to suggest Beijing made these calls in response to US requests. Beijing's reported discussions with Tehran on this issue have been specific on the potential attacks on Chinese vessels and its adverse effects for bilateral business ties. \nSome analysts have claimed China is freeloading on US-provided security in the region, is being risk-averse or lacks the political clout to shape outcomes in the Middle East, and is prioritising geopolitics over addressing regional security concerns. Such claims, however, fail to provide a compelling account of Beijing's military strategy and diplomatic approach in the region. \nFor starters, Beijing's top priorities are unification with Taiwan, national unity, and defending its claims over disputed continental and maricreated_at regions. Additionally, safeguarding Chinese people, businesses and investments along its ­maricreated_at superhighway - extending from coastal China through the South China Sea and Malacca Strait to the Arabian Sea and East African coast - is a key concern. \nChina's military is primarily committed to protecting these interests and asserting sovereignty and control over the disputed regions. If there is any chance of military confrontation with another country, it would be likely to occur along the disputed land border in the Himalayas or maricreated_at regions in the South and East China seas. \nThe western Pacific is a region where China is largely devoted to trying to deny the United States any military advantage. In conflicts with neighbouring countries, China describes the US as an outsider and accuses it of unwarranted interference. It also claims other regional countries' ­assertiveness is a result of US influence. \nIn addition, China has condemned US support of Israel in the Gaza war and its recent strikes against Iran-backed groups. Beijing strongly opposes Israel's actions against Palestinians and seeks a ceasefire and a two-state solution under the banner of its stated commitment to peace. \nThat helps explain China's lack of military presence in other regions as a cornerstone of its foreign policy. Fudan University professor Chuchu Zhang and Sujata Ashwarya, an assistant professor at India's Jamia Millia Islamia, note China's perception of the Middle East as a high-risk region. So, instead of assuming a security role like that of the US, China calls on regional actors such as Saudi Arabia and Iran to unite and address the Palestinian issue. \nThis underscores a crucial reason for China's non-involvement in the Red Sea conflict with the Houthis. Beijing does not worry that doing so would buttress the US position or look like it was bowing to US influence. Rather, it stems from the ­recognition that such involvement would fail to address the underlying causes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or further China's regional interests. \nWhile the Houthi attacks have not had as large an impact on Chinese interests, China has cautioned Iran of potential repercussions to their business relations should such attacks occur. Contrary to popular belief, Beijing has ­significant influence over Tehran, given that crude imports from Iran constitute just 10 per cent of China's overall energy imports but represent 90 per cent of Iran's crude exports. \nTehran cannot afford to jeopardise its ties with Beijing, especially as China ­deepens its connections throughout the Middle East. If China can safeguard its ­people, businesses and investments in the region through diplomatic channels, there is little reason to pursue military pressure against Iran or its proxies, particularly as their primary focus is countering US ­influence in the region. \nFinally, the Middle East arguably holds no direct link to China's core interests or feature prominently in the daily lives of average Chinese citizens. Public sencreated_atnt in China isn't significantly swayed by Middle East crises in the same manner as relations with other regional countries or major powers. Beijing's stance towards other nations is thus viewed as a necessary means to bolster nationalism. \nRiaz Khokhar is an MA political science candidate at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden\n"

The plane disappeared over the South China Sea during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing on March 8, 2014. It was reported that the plane became lost from the surveillance radar screens around 40 minutes into the flight.\nOne week after the plane was declared missing, the Malaysian prime minister at the created_at, Najib Razak alleged there was a \"high degree of certainty\" that communications with MH370's cockpit were deliberately halted.\nOver the years, dozens of theories have been made, including that the disappearance was part of a murder-suicide by the captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53. However, this theory was never confirmed by officials.\nNow, former Qantas pilot and RAAF training captain Mike Glynn, has explained how simple it would have been for someone in the cockpit to alter the fate of more than 200 passengers onboard the plane that day.\nHe said there are many ways that someone in the cockpit could have deliberately caused the disappearance and said the person could've made \"sure the door's locked, so no one can get in. Nothing that anyone could do.\" The retired pilot then spoke about the jet's outflow valves, which manage the release of air to pressurise the cabin to ensure a safe environment.\n\"When you open these outflow valves, the aircraft depressurises very quickly,\" he told Sky News. \"If the aircraft is not going to descend, you'll start to feel very hypoxic within three or four minutes.\" The pilot was asked whether the door of the cockpit was \"tricky\" to lock. In response, he said it wasn't and said it was designed to keep people out.\n\"The door will automatically close, and you can lock it with this switch,\" he explained. \"And you can also, there's a manual deadbolt that prohibits any sort of entry into the flight deck. You can have a full-on attack on the door, it's not going to change a thing.\" Glynn will appear on Sky News Australia's latest documentary -MH370: Ten Years On this week.

China holds indisputable sovereignty over Huangyan Island and its adjacent waters, and the CCG's actions are legitimate activities to enforce the law in China's jurisdictional waters.\nWere it not for the professionalism and restraint of the Chinese side, Manila's provocative moves might have easily escalated into skirmishes and even open conflict. Something Beijing is carefully trying to avoid but which Manila seems to covet, no doubt in the belief, however misplaced, that it has Washington's backing.\nAlthough escalated tensions do not serve the interests of any regional country, including those of the Philippines, open conflict between China and the Philippines, in the eyes of Washington would serve the US' agenda of derailing China's development.\nThe joint statement released by Beijing and Manila during President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's visit to Beijing one year ago, and the series of cooperation projects the two sides have carried out ever since, clearly highlight the tremendous benefits the Philippines can draw from cooperation with China. Manila should take a more rational view of the US' intentions, as it only regards the Philippines as a useful piece on the board in its geopolitical game with China.\nThanks to the tacit consensus between China and the Philippines, their maricreated_at disputes have been shelved for decades in favor of win-win cooperation. It is the US that has sought to sabotage this consensus. That's why Beijing has always exercised patience toward Manila, despite its provocations.\nThe Marcos government cites \"security concerns\" to justify its leveraging the US' desire to militarize the region as \"security\" for its breaking and entering activities. But barking dogs that bark for the sake of straining the leash are nothing but a nuisance.\n \n"

    "text": "\nBeijing's top priorities are unification with Taiwan, national unity and defending its claims over disputed continental and maricreated_at regionsAs long as its interests in the Middle East aren't directly threatened, there is little reason to pursue military influence or join US-led security efforts\nThe United States is reportedly considering deploying two more aircraft carriers to its western Pacific fleet, which already consists of three carriers. These potential deployments, along with recent naval exercises involving Japan and South Korea in the East China Sea and the expected visit of US senators to Taiwan this week, underline Washington's dedication to prioritising its strategic interests in the region. \nThis commitment persists even as the US remains involved in safeguarding commercial ships in the Red Sea amid tensions with Yemen's Houthis. These developments are happening on the back of a recent meeting between US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Bangkok, aimed at establishing guard rails on bilateral relations. \nThe top issues that the Chinese readout of the meeting mentioned were Taiwan and Washington's alleged politicisation of economic issues for national security - in other words, restrictions on the export of advanced technology to China. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nThe security issue in the Middle East was mentioned tangentially with a reference to global and regional issues in places including Ukraine, Myanmar, the Korean peninsula and South China Sea. The statements from the two sides did not even refer to the Red Sea crisis, including the Houthi attacks on commercial vessels or the recent killings of US soldiers in Jordan. \nThese interactions highlight that the Middle East security issue is not a top agenda item for US-China talks, yet other reports suggest Washington has reached out to Beijing asking it to influence Iran in restraining its proxy militia activities in the region. \nIran-backed Houthis have been targeting commercial vessels in and around the Red Sea, disrupting maricreated_at trade and increasing shipping costs, including for China. In response, Beijing has criticised the harassment and attacks on civilian vessels, as well as the disruption of supply chains and the global trading regime, without specifying the responsible party. \nThere is no evidence to suggest Beijing made these calls in response to US requests. Beijing's reported discussions with Tehran on this issue have been specific on the potential attacks on Chinese vessels and its adverse effects for bilateral business ties. \nSome analysts have claimed China is freeloading on US-provided security in the region, is being risk-averse or lacks the political clout to shape outcomes in the Middle East, and is prioritising geopolitics over addressing regional security concerns. Such claims, however, fail to provide a compelling account of Beijing's military strategy and diplomatic approach in the region. \nFor starters, Beijing's top priorities are unification with Taiwan, national unity, and defending its claims over disputed continental and maricreated_at regions. Additionally, safeguarding Chinese people, businesses and investments along its maricreated_at superhighway - extending from coastal China through the South China Sea and Malacca Strait to the Arabian Sea and East African coast - is a key concern. \nChina's military is primarily committed to protecting these interests and asserting sovereignty and control over the disputed regions. If there is any chance of military confrontation with another country, it would be likely to occur along the disputed land border in the Himalayas or maricreated_at regions in the South and East China seas. \nThe western Pacific is a region where China is largely devoted to trying to deny the United States any military advantage. In conflicts with neighbouring countries, China describes the US as an outsider and accuses it of unwarranted interference. It also claims other regional countries' assertiveness is a result of US influence. \nIn addition, China has condemned US support of Israel in the Gaza war and its recent strikes against Iran-backed groups. Beijing strongly opposes Israel's actions against Palestinians and seeks a ceasefire and a two-state solution under the banner of its stated commitment to peace. \nThat helps explain China's lack of military presence in other regions as a cornerstone of its foreign policy. Fudan University professor Chuchu Zhang and Sujata Ashwarya, an assistant professor at India's Jamia Millia Islamia, note China's perception of the Middle East as a high-risk region. So, instead of assuming a security role like that of the US, China calls on regional actors such as Saudi Arabia and Iran to unite and address the Palestinian issue. \nThis underscores a crucial reason for China's non-involvement in the Red Sea conflict with the Houthis. Beijing does not worry that doing so would buttress the US position or look like it was bowing to US influence. Rather, it stems from the recognition that such involvement would fail to address the underlying causes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or further China's regional interests. \nWhile the Houthi attacks have not had as large an impact on Chinese interests in the region, China has cautioned Iran of potential repercussions to their business relations should such attacks occur. Contrary to popular belief, Beijing has significant influence over Tehran, given that crude imports from Iran constitute just 10 per cent of China's overall energy imports but represent 90 per cent of Iran's crude exports. \nTehran cannot afford to jeopardise its ties with Beijing, especially as China deepens its connections throughout the Middle East. If China can safeguard its people, businesses and investments in the region through diplomatic channels, there is little reason to pursue military pressure against Iran or its proxies, particularly as their primary focus is countering US influence in the region. \nFinally, the Middle East arguably holds no direct link to China's core interests or feature prominently in the daily lives of average Chinese citizens. Public sencreated_atnt in China isn't significantly swayed by Middle East crises in the same manner as relations with other regional countries or major powers. Beijing's stance towards other nations is thus viewed as a necessary means to bolster nationalism. \nRiaz Khokhar is an MA political science candidate at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden\nCopyright (c) 2024.

    "created_at": "2024-02-19",
    "text": "\nAn ex-Australian naval officer claims authorities were searching for the MH370 aircraft in the wrong area a year after the flight mysteriously disappeared.\nMalaysian Airlines Flight MH370 vanished over the South China Sea during its journey from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China, on March 8, 2014.\nThe puzzling case made titles across the world as the plane, which had 239 people on board including six Australians, seemingly disappeared without a trace.\nPeter Waring was appointed deputy operations manager of the search in September, 2014, but said he began to have 'serious doubts' about how the investigation was being carried out in May 2015.\n'At various points we made it seem as though we have a very good sense of where it was, but that just wasn't the case,' he told Sky News.\n'We had absolutely, more or less, next to nothing. \n'Over created_at, the operation was wrapped in an armature of bureaucracy, if you will, and that made it more difficult to change course.'\nHis comments come ahead of Sky News releasing its documentary MH370: Ten Years On on Tuesday night.\nMr Waring, a former navy lieutenant, said despite evidence suggesting the aircraft may be in another area, the search operation was unable to change its course.\n'In some ways we had shackled ourselves to this one particular area and weren't flexible to look elsewhere when there was evidence to suggest perhaps it was elsewhere,' he said.\nHe said by mid-2015, enough of the sea floor had been covered to discount the 'leading assumption' that the aircraft had crashed into the Indian Ocean near an area known as the 7th Arc.\n'If that assumption had been correct we would have found the aircraft at that point,' he said.\n                     READ MORE: Peter Waring's theory MH370 deliberately crashed                    \nSpeaking to Sky News presenter Peter Stefanovic in the documentary, Mr Waring said there was no 'plan B' in the search and they were moving further away from areas where the airplane was likely to be.\nHe was also at a loss as to why the Australian Transport Safety Bureau was chosen to lead the search operation. \n'But the question really needs to be asked why the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is an aircraft investigation authority, not a search and rescue authority, not an organisation that has any experience of conducting a search, why they were put in charge of one of the largest and most expensive searches in human history,' he said in the documentary.\nMr Waring said the upcoming 10-year anniversary of the disappearance of MH370 was just 'another reminder of the failure' in the search mission.\n'The fact we are now no closer to finding the aircraft than we were when we were spending millions and millions of dollars eight to 10 years ago,' he said.\nHowever, an Australian fisherman Kit Olver, 77, claimed last year that his trawler pulled up what appeared to be the wing of a commercial airliner in late, 2014.\nHe claims he was fishing some 55km off the southeast coast of South Australia, in the Southern Ocean, when his net snagged on something large.\n'It was a bloody great wing of a big jet airliner,' Mr Olver said.\n'I've questioned myself. I've looked for a way out of this.\n'I wish to Christ I'd never seen the thing... but there it is. It was a jet's wing.'\nAs he had held a pilot's licence, Mr Olver was confident the wing was larger than any on a typical private plane.\nHis discovery was backed-up by Mr Waring who said it was 'plausible' for debris from the wreckage to be found in southern Australia, considering more than 20 pieces of possible wreckage have been discovered in Africa.\n"

    "text": "\n The rule of law is besieged in the South China Sea and the East China Sea because of the aggressive Chinese claims of ownership and sovereignty over Taiwan, almost the entire SCS, and over islets in the ECS, and the challenges posed by the riparian states and the Western powers.\nCHINA AVOWS A LONG AND GLORIOUS HISTORY that, per my column on June 20, 2021, rivals Egypt and its pharaohs, and Greece and its Olympic gods.\nFrom the mid-1800s up to the mid-1900s, however, China experienced a harrowing decay that forced her to accept shameful, one-sided treaties and the cruel treatment of its nationals. To the Chinese, losing face is worse than losing life.\nDuring World War II, the Japanese invaded and occupied the Paracels and Spratlys in the SCS. In 1945, after the war, in accordance with the Cairo and Potsdam declarations, the Kuomintang-led China, which was allied with the victors, accepted the surrender of the Japanese garrisons in Taiwan and the SCS.In 1950, Mao Zedong's hordes drove the Kuomintang army out of the Chinese mainland into Taiwan and took over the Paracels and Spratlys.\nIn appreciation of Chinese assistance during the Vietnam War, North Vietnam relinquished its claims to the Paracels and the Spratlys.In 1974, China expelled the South Vietnamese from Shanhu Island enabling it to control most of the Paracels. However, after the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the united Vietnam turned around and adopted the South's claim of sovereignty over all the riparian maricreated_at features in the SCS. As of now, most if not all the features in the SCS are occupied or garrisoned: about 29 by Vietnam, 11 by the Philippines, seven by China, six by Malaysia, two by Taiwan, and one by Brunei.\nCHINA HAS BECOME THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY in the world during the last 30 years. It boasts of the biggest standing military on earth with a nuclear arsenal. It has propelled astronauts to the moon and built its own space station. Its science, tech, and economic titans often outbid and outstrip their Western peers.\nNonetheless, despite its might, China is constricted. It is surrounded by hostile neighbors. Its only dependable neighbors are North Korea, Cambodia, and Mongolia. In short, though already a superpower, China could not expand its horizons except through the ECS and the SCS. To boost its economy, it needs to control the sea lanes in the SCS. And to enhance its security, it sees the SCS as its first line of defense against United States militarism. And offensively, the SCS serves as the passage to the Pacific and Indian oceans for its nuclear submarines.\nTo expand its horizon beyond its shores, China has revived its so-called 'nine-dash line' (later expanded to the ten-dash line) which covers almost the entire SCS. To buttress its claims, it has-covertly in the beginning but flagrantly now-built fortresses, airstrips, missile silos, and other fortifications in the SCS. Moreover, it claims ownership and sovereignty over a group of barren isles in the ECS called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan. It also has disputes with Japan over the dividing line in the ECS.\nOUR CLAIM IN THE SCS IS BUTTRESSED BY THE ARBITRAL AWARD (AA) which is based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos). However, the AA covers only sovereign rights on and above the maricreated_at domain, not sovereignty or ownership on and above the land features and their territorial seas. In contrast, China, Vietnam, etc. anchor theirs on history, discovery, occupation, control, and/or cession via treaties (like the Cairo and Potsdam declarations) over the sea, air, and land domains.\nThe AA, though unrecognized by China, outlawed the nine-dash line and declared freedom of navigation in the SCS that the Western powers use to justify their joint freedom of navigation sorties to the discomfort of China. China wants to recover Taiwan as a part of its territory, a recovery that international law recognizes as a state right, as an internal affair. Au contraire, Taiwan claims the right of self-determination to be a separate country. Though the US and the Western powers pursue a one-China policy, they have entered mutual defense treaties to defend Taiwan from an 'invasion' from China.\nThe Philippines is an international pygmy in the rule of force but a giant in the rule of law. It is the only country that can boast of an AA to advance its sovereign rights. The Duterte administration tried to befriend and placate China to no avail. Thus, the Marcos regime pivoted away and called on the US to help push back the Sinos. It has filed hundreds of diplomatic protests over the Chinese incursions. It has exposed through open media coverage the Chinese 'grey zone tactics' like water cannons and lane cuttings, to the international discomfiture of China.\nIndeed, to insist on the observance of the rule of law is the only recourse of the Philippines to counter the rule of force in the besieged China Sea. While China may have the right to recover its 'renegade province' of Taiwan under the rule of law, will it also observe the rule of law in respecting our maricreated_at rights under the AA and Unclos?\n"

    "text": "\nFeb. 19—KUALA LUMPUR ( The Star/ANN) — IT was a brief but memorable event: a five minute presentation of the breathtaking sight of bright spiral lights and colours, with dancers and percussionists performing on stage to launch the Asean Community — a landmark achievement for a group which started with just five founding members in 1967.\nThe Asean Community launch took place in Kuala Lumpur in 2015, the year Malaysia was the Asean Chair. Witnessed by leaders from Asean and their dialogue partners — Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and Russia — and even United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki Moon, then prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak declared that the community was not just about the economy.\n\"It is also about recognising the special ties that bind the people and about making our citizens feel that Asean courses through their veins. That is what will make our community a reality. That is what will reward the efforts and contributions of previous leaders and peoples of Asean, without whose help we would not have reached this historic milestone,\" said Najib.\nIn 2015, Asean leaders perceived the Asean Community as \"politically cohesive, economically integrated and socially responsible\" to face future challenges and opportunities.\nThe 10-year vision will expire next year, so what is next in the next decade? The high-level task force on Asean Community post 2025 (comprising eminent persons from the region) has been holding meetings on the future of the community not just for the next 10 years but it will now be for 20 years!\nAsean leaders during their summit in Indonesia last year agreed the task force would develop a visionary, inspirational, robust, comprehensive, inclusive, and forward-looking Asean Community Post-2025 Vision, to address current and future challenges and trends inside and beyond the region within a 20-year created_atframe.\nThe Asean Community Vision 2045 (ACV 2045) consists of five issue clusters, namely the Asean Political Security Community (APSC), Asean Economic Community (AEC), Asean Social Cultural Community (ASCC), Asean Connectivity, and Institutional Strengthening.\nIt is not Asean if its statements are not full of jargon, making it difficult for the man in the street to comprehend. What does it all mean, actually?\nWell, basically, Asean is now looking at various megatrends which have an impact on a global scale. It is about the need for the group to be forward- and outward-looking. Among the megatrends being looked are increased protectionism, digital technologies, UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate change.\nIn the 1990s, Asean grew into 10 countries with the addition of its least developed countries, namely, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. Look at these countries more than two decades later, especially Vietnam which is outperforming some of the founding nations economically.\nAsean secretary-general Kao Kim Hourn said Asean is forecast to be the world's fourth largest economy by 2030 as its combined gross domestic product (GDP) value has already reached trillions of dollars with a population of over 670 million people.\n\"This makes Asean the third largest economy in Asia and the fifth largest in the world,\" he said last year.\nSome eminent members felt that the vision should be on a longer created_at frame with a view that Asean's future should not only continue to be peaceful and stable but also future-ready economically. No one can deny the region still has a lot to realise in achieving its full potential to make the grouping more vibrant and dynamic.\nConsider this. None of its members is at war, the region is relatively peaceful. Yes, Myanmar remains a thorn its with human rights violations. How long will the conflict last? No one can predict and Asean is still trying to get the military junta to adhere to its five-point consensus to end the violence.\nOf course, another issue is the South China Sea which remains a hot one, but so far Asean and China are managing to keep peace in the disputed area. Adding to this is the fact that the group has managed to maintain good relations with both Beijing and Washington.\nAmid these issues, Asean still needs to move on with the various challenges and opportunities available. Asean would be well placed if it gets things right from the very beginning.\nMalaysia is serious about its Asean chairmanship in 2025. Last month, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim chaired a meeting to launch the Asean-Malaysia 2025 chairmanship and he will be attending periodic preparation meetings.\nThree main clusters were established: the political, defence, and citizenship cluster under the Foreign Ministry; the economic and trade cluster under the Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry; and the cultural and social cluster under the Tourism, Arts, and Culture Ministry.\nIn less than one year, Laos will hand over the Asean Chair baton to Malaysia. It is no easy task to come up with a 20-year vision for a region within a grouping that was once dismissed by many as nothing but a talk shop. Hopefully the momentum to take Asean to the next level under Malaysia's chairmanship will go full speed ahead instead of just being many gatherings of officials in suits.\n___ (c)2024 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

    "created_at": "2024-02-19",
    "text": "\nThe Biden administration is now focusing on implementing its goals for the Indo-Pacific, said analysts, as a White House strategist who initiated policies for the region moves to the State Department.\nKurt Campbell, who served as Indo-Pacific coordinator for the White House National Security Council, initiated strategies that moved allies and partners to cooperate on challenges across the region, from counterbalancing China's rise to offsetting North Korea's threats. He is going to a new position at the State Department.\nHe takes on the role of the deputy secretary of state, a position vacant since July when Wendy Sherman retired. The Senate confirmed Campbell on February 6 after President Joe Biden nominated him for the position in November.\nCampbell's position as the Indo-Pacific coordinator will be left unfilled, the Financial created_ats reported on February 6. Experts said that if the Biden administration did not fill the Indo-Pacific position, it would be a signal that Washington was now focusing on implementing the strategies Campbell set in place.\n\"Important initiatives such as the Indo-Pacific strategy and the Camp David summit are among the results of the decision by the incoming Biden administration to create a brand-new position of Indo-Pacific coordinator,\" said Daniel Russel, who served as the assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs during the Obama administration.\n\"Now that those and other initiatives have been launched and that interagency coordination on Indo-Pacific policy has matured, the administration's challenge is in implementation and the need for a 'coordinator' in the White House has diminished,\" Russel said Tuesday via email. He is the vice president for International Security and Diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\nBiden appointed Campbell as the White House Indo-Pacific coordinator in January 2021. Creation of the position came amid China's increasing assertiveness in the region.\nCampbell was instrumental in bringing together South Korea and Japan for a summit with the U.S. at Camp David in August. The two moved beyond their historical animosity and agreed to work together against China's regional aggression and North Korea's missile launches.\nCampbell led the inaugural meeting of the Nuclear Consultative Group held in July in Seoul to strengthen the bilateral alliance and reassure South Korea of U.S. nuclear deterrence in the region.\nHe also revamped the informal transregional agreement known as the QUAD among Australia, India, Japan and the U.S. in March 2021 and played a key role in creating a trilateral security partnership among Australia, the U.K. and the U.S., or AUKUS, in September 2021. China views both as security ties threatening its rise to dominance in the region.\nPatrick Cronin, the Asia-Pacific security chair at the Hudson Institute, said via email on Tuesday that Campbell's \"central role over the past three years in defining strategies to compete [with], cooperate [with], and confront China marks a clear path for engaging allies and partners, dealing with China, and helping the U.S. negotiate from strength.\"\nCronin continued, \"His absence as Indo-Pacific coordinator will be significantly mitigated by his presence at the State [Department] and the outstanding team he has left at the White House to help carry out a vision he helped to mold.\"\nBut concerns remain about the unfilled position for a region fraught with rising threats from North Korea and coercive moves by China, according to some analysts.\nDennis Wilder, senior director for East Asia at the White House's National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration, said via email, \"The Biden administration should reconsider its decision not to keep the position at a created_at when there is so much uncertainty about North Korea and China's intentions.\"\nNorth Korea's state media KCNA said on Thursday that the country tested new surface-to-sea missiles under the supervision of leader Kim Jong Un the day before. It was the regime's fifth cruise missile test this year as Pyongyang threatens to take more aggressive moves against South Korea.\nChina continues to antagonize its neighbors in South China Sea with maricreated_at maneuvers to assert its claim of sovereignty over disputed territories.\nAside from security issues, Wilder, currently a senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University, said, \"A major priority left undone in the Biden Indo-Pacific strategy is trade policy.\"\nWilder said via email on Wednesday, \"The IPEF [Indo-Pacific Framework] attempt to deal with this issue is stalled by congressional resistance because of concerns over the labor, human rights and climate change policies of partner nations. The administration must find a way to balance the robust security alliances and partnerships with an equally effective set of regional economic policies.\"\nThe IPEF includes four pillars: trade; supply chains; clean energy, decarbonization and infrastructure; and tax and anti-corruption. Biden launched the IPEF in Tokyo in May 2022 to set up sustainable common standards among countries in the region. The IPEF partners including South Korea and Japan account for 40% of the global economy.\nChina, not an IPEF member, perceives it as an ineffective effort to reduce its economic influence. He Weiwen, a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, told the official Global created_ats in 2023, \"The IPEF is neither a trade agreement nor an economic community. It's just a framework, meaning that it will have no real efficacy.\" - VOA\n"

    "text": "\nA German military strategist would call it a \"schwerpunkt\" the centre of gravity or the critical focal point. More people some four billion live inside a 3,300-kilometre radius circle centred on the small town of Mong Khet in Myanmar, than live outside it. This is the decisive area for the 21st centurys energy and climate geography.\nThis circle contains the first, second, fourth and fifth most populous countries in the world, namely India, China, Indonesia and Pakistan. From a geopolitical perspective, it contains a majority of adherents of three great world religions Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism as well as the secular philosophy of communism.\nFrom a climate point of view, it produces more than half of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. It also accounts for 45 per cent of the worlds primary energy demand and 57 per cent of solar power capacity.\nBut with just 7 per cent of global oil production and 13 per cent of gas output, it is always destined to be a major fossil fuel importer.\nThe circle also hosts geopolitical flashpoints: the Korean peninsula, the competing claims of the littoral states to the South China Sea, Taiwan, regarded by Beijing as a breakaway province, the disputed Sino-Indian border, the important Strait of Malacca, and the perennially tense India-Pakistan relationship.\nAnd within this is the majority of the worlds manufacturing capacity for clean energy technologies solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and electric vehicles mostly in China, but in the near future India, too.\nThere is also an increasing share of energy innovation, again in China but also in Japan and Taiwan. China dominates the mining and processing of rare earths, while Indonesia and, secondarily, the Philippines produce more than half the worlds nickel, crucial materials for electric motors, wind turbines and batteries.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that a liveable global climate, a stable energy market, depend much more on what happens within this circle over the next 70-odd years than on Washington, Brussels, Moscow or even the Gulf.\nThe GCC is well aware. Proximity to India makes it impossible to ignore: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has just concluded his visit to the UAE and Qatar. Asia is the main destination for the Middle Easts oil and gas exports, and Saudi Aramco has invested heavily to boost its refining and petrochemical capacity in China and Malaysia.\nIn contrast, the West has not yet woken up to this reality. Of course, there are honourable exceptions. The International Energy Agency plans to start membership talks with India; it also has associate agreements with China, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore.\nThe Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air provides invaluable insights into Chinese environmental policy.\nBut mainstream climate and energy opinion focuses far too much on developments in the US and Western Europe.\nIt seems to think that the goal of limiting global warming can be achieved solely by demonising oil and gas companies, imposing ever tougher emissions targets on Europe, and opposing more fossil-fuel production and transport projects. Such a lack of perspective ignores Asian needs, realities and opinions.\nMany Asian countries suffer from terrible air quality, mostly because of pollution from coal burning and traffic, causing serious health problems. China has made significant progress in recent years in switching district heating systems and industry to gas.\nIndia, so far, has not, and it now has one of the worst urban air quality globally. Simplistic and skewed calculations that claim gas is worse for the climate than coal because of methane leakage entirely ignores other pollutants.\nBecause of a relative lack of fossil-fuel resources particularly oil and gas versus consumption, Asian countries are acutely aware of their need for energy security. Japan and Taiwan are virtual island economies, while South Korea is a landlocked peninsula. All three are particularly vulnerable to any interruption.\nThey see the value of renewables and nuclear power in providing domestic self-sufficiency, but they also value long-term relations with reliable oil and gas providers.\nFor China, India and Indonesia, the situation is a bit different. They have abundant cheap domestic coal, which also has strong domestic political and business constituencies. The giant scale of their energy needs, and its rapid growth, mean that they need all forms of energy for now.\nGas will have to be cheap, and renewables will have to overcome problems of financing, project siting and grid access to make inroads into coal use.\nFor all of them, if they cannot obtain oil and natural gas from the US, Australia or from African projects backed by western funding, they will get it from the Middle East, Russia and Central Asia.\nAsian countries will indeed suffer badly from climate change it is one of the major factors that could prevent the 21st century from being the fabled Chinese Century or Indian Century.\nThey still maintain they have limited historic responsibility for emissions, a contention that is increasingly not true in the case of China. But western hectoring will not be constructive.\nA more constructive approach will work on common interests. It will be pragmatic, recognising that partial progress on reducing emissions is better than a fruitless pursuit of perfection.\nIt will concentrate on supplying greater quantities of cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy, rather than restricting availability of disfavoured options. It will seek to combine disparate strengths in innovation, manufacturing, financing and project management to rapidly scale up low-carbon systems.\nAt a created_at of growing global conflict and tension, energy is a lever against rivals, while climate remains a rare bright spot of international co-operation. Solving the 21st centurys environmental and energy challenges centres on that Asian circle.\n"

    "text": "\nStories being covered today by BBC Monitoring from Chinese broadcast, press and social media sources.\nForeign minister justifies Ukraine stance at Munich Security Conference\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in a question-and-answer session after a speech at the Munich Security Conference on 17 February, again justified Beijing's position on the \"Ukraine crisis\" and said China will not give up its \"constructive role\" in bringing the conflict to an end \"as long as there is a glimmer of hope\".\n\"China did not create the Ukraine crisis, nor is it a party to the crisis, yet China neither stood idle nor took advantage of the crisis to make gains,\" he said in an apparent jibe at US military support for Ukraine.\nIn his keynote speech during the \"China in the World\" session at the Conference the same day, Wang had said China will continue to mediation efforts on the Middle East, Ukraine, the Korean Peninsula, Myanmar and Afghanistan, and speed up negotiations with Asean on a code of conduct on South China Sea territorial disputes, according to a readout of the speech released by state-run Chinese newspaper Global created_ats.\nThe Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post, however, noted remarks on Ukraine not seen in Chinese official media. Wang reportedly said there were \"not ripe conditions in place for parties to go back to the negotiating table\", without saying what the terms would need to be.\nSeparately, during talks with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on 18 February, Wang Yi stressed that China \"does not sell lethal weapons to conflict areas or parties to conflicts\" or add fuel to the fire or profit from conflicts, China's state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.\nThis is Wang's first first face-to-face meeting with Kuleba since last year's Munich Security Conference.\nSee also: Wang Yi highlights China's 'stabilising' role in 'turbulent' world\nChina expresses concern at UN meeting over US, UK strikes in Red Sea\nBriefing: Chinese diplomats' low-key mediation in international conflicts\nForeign minister holds talks with Lord Cameron, Blinken\nXinhua also released numerous readouts of Wang Yi's flurry of meetings with foreign counterparts on the sidelines of the Munich conference, including Foreign Secretary David Cameron and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\nWang and Lord Cameron both spoke of the need to \"properly handle differences and conflicts\" when meeting on 16 February \"at the latter's request\", Xinhua reported.\nWang said the two sides should \"push China-UK relations back on the right track of healthy and stable development\". Cameron said that the UK is \"willing to view UK-China relations from a strategic perspective\".\nXinhua left out \"areas of disagreement\" raised by Lord Cameron, as mentioned in an FCO readout, including human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, Chinese sanctions on UK MPs, and the jailing of British national Jimmy Lai. He also touched on the threat of Russia's \"aggression against Ukraine\" and urged China to \"use its influence on Iran to pressure the Houthis over their actions in the Red Sea\".\nMeanwhile, Xinhua reported Wang Yi holding a \"candid, substantive and constructive\" meeting with Blinken on 16 February, where the Chinese minister voiced Beijing's grievances on a range of issues, leading with Taiwan.\nWang said the US should abide by the one-China principle and put its pledge of not supporting \"Taiwan independence\" into practice.\nHe also warned that \"decoupling from China\" will eventually backfire on the US itself. He called for the US to lift \"illegal unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals\".\nThe Global created_ats later quoted an unnamed Chinese foreign ministry official saying Wang had voiced Beijing's rejection of \"groundless accusations and pressure\" from the US on Ukraine during the one-hour and 40-minute meeting.\nSee also: Munich Security Conference 2023: China diplomat urges ending 'Ukraine crisis' in talks with Ukraine minister\nChina says David Cameron's remarks on freedom of navigation 'completely wrong'\nWest's 'derisking' strategy on China blamed for 'lose-lose' dynamics\nChina to conduct regular patrols in waters near Kinmen\nThe China Coast Guard (CCG) said its Fujian Bureau will carry out \"regular law enforcement patrols in the waters of Xiamen-Kinmen area\", days after the deaths of two Chinese fishermen whose boat capsized during a chase by Taiwanese patrols in the waters near the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen.\nThe statement announced on 18 February said the CCG patrols will \"further safeguard relevant maricreated_at operation order\" and protect the property and lives of fishermen, state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) reported.\nOn the same day, Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO), a cabinet-level ministry under the State Council, welcomed the patrols, while also criticising the Taiwan side's \"disregard of human lives\" and \"bad attitude\" over the incident, Xinhua reported on 18 February.\nXinhua also reported a day earlier Zhu's denial of Taiwan's claim of legal maricreated_at law enforcement in a separate statement, saying that \"there is no such a thing as prohibited or restricted waters\".\nExpressing \"deep regret\" over Beijing's \"groundless accusations\", Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said on 18 February that it would \"continue with law enforcement\" in waters it controls, according to the government-affiliated Central News Agency (CNA).\nSee also: China condemns Taiwan as two fishermen drown after chase with coast guard\nTaiwan thanks US Senate for passing aid bill\nBriefing: Taiwan affirms ties with Palau despite alleged Beijing 'pressure'\nSpring Festival concludes with record domestic tourism revenue\nNational broadcaster China Central Television's (CCTV) flagship evening news bulletin Xinwen Lianbo (News Hookup) on 18 February highlighted \"China's economic vitality\" brought by a consumption boom during the eight-day Spring Festival holiday, or known as the Chinese new year.\nThe bulletin noted over 2.3 billion cross-province trips were made, and online payment transactions and restaurant visits grew compared to last year.\nDomestic tourism spending reached 632.68 billion yuan ($87.92 billion), a 47.3% increase compared to last year, the bulletin added.\nXinhua reported on the same day that the domestic tourism spending surpassed the 2019 pre-pandemic level by 7.7%, while noting that movie box office revenue grew over 80% year on year.\nParcel deliveries during the holiday saw 82.1% year-on-year growth, state-owned China News Service cited China Post as saying.\nMeanwhile, Taiwan media reported that tens of thousands of tourists are stranded in Gansu due to heavy snow and sand storms, but state media largely downplayed it and chose to highlight positive stories of locals extending a helping hand.\nSee also: Briefing: Chinese state media portray prosperous economy in Year of the Dragon\nState TV promotes green development, domestic consumption during Spring Festival\nState TV promotes China's foreign trade boom during Spring Festival\nComing up\nForeign Minister Wang Yi is visiting France and Spain between 19 and 21 February.

He also expressed willingness to promote freedom of shipping and air flights in this area, pointing to the need for \"protecting the legitimate rights of other countries in the region.\"\nFor several decades Beijing has been at odds with some countries over the territorial affiliation of certain islands in the South China Sea, where significant offshore hydrocarbon reserves have been discovered. First and foremost, this concerns the archipelagos of Xisha (Paracel Islands), Nansha (Spratlys) and Huangyan (Scarborough Reef). Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines are involved in these disputes. In recent years, the rifts have been eased somewhat through multilateral efforts, including China-ASEAN engagement.\nSource: Russian News Agency\n"

    "text": "\nBeijing accuses Manila of 'roping in non-regional countries' to stir trouble in the region as allies hold second drill this monthTensions over the waterway are heated as the Philippines mulls permanent facility on contested reef and accuses Chinese fishermen of harming ecosystem\nThe People's Liberation Army said it sent forces to the South China Sea to monitor the latest US-Philippines joint air patrol on Monday as the two allies launched their second drill in the disputed waters this month. \nThe air forces of the two countries conducted a patrol over the western Philippines as part of what they have called a \"maricreated_at cooperative activity\". \nIn response, China accused the Philippines of \"roping in non-regional countries to stir trouble in the South China Sea\" and \"publicly hyping up a so-called joint air patrol\", though it did not directly refer to the United States. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nThe Southern Theatre Command, the PLA division that oversees the South China Sea, said on Monday night it had sent its naval and air forces to closely watch the situation. The command said it had kept the situation \"under control\" and that it would \"maintain a high level of vigilance\" to defend national sovereignty and preserve regional stability. \nThe Philippine Air Force sent three FA-50 combat aircraft while the US Pacific Air Forces sent a B-52H bomber to patrol the area, the Philippine Air Force said on Facebook. \nManila and Washington also carried out an air and sea patrol on February 9. Beijing responded with routine air and naval patrols and said it was maintaining a \"high level of vigilance\". \nChina claims most of the South China Sea based on its \"nine-dash line\" - a line that Beijing says appears on historical maps and that has been used to justify its maricreated_at claims. But Beijing's claims to the resource-rich and strategically important waterway have been disputed by countries in the region, including the Philippines and Vietnam. \nBeijing's tensions with Manila over the South China Sea have been especially heated in recent months. The Philippines has accused China of repeatedly obstructing resupply missions within its exclusive economic zone, while Beijing said the Philippine vessels entered its territory illegally. \nClashes between the coastguards of the two countries near Second Thomas Shoal, or Renai Jiao in Chinese, have also prompted Manila to mull plans to install permanent facilities on the reef, which Beijing warned would be met with \"resolute responses\". \nThis week, the Philippines accused Chinese fishermen of using cyanide to catch fish and \"intentionally destroy\" the disputed Scarborough Shoal, known as Huangyan Island in China. \nCyanide fishing has been banned in many countries, including the Philippines, as the toxic chemical can devastate the marine ecosystem. \nChinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Monday the accusation was \"fabricated\" as the Chinese government \"highly values ecological protection and fishery resources and conservation\". \nBilateral relations have pivoted since Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr took office in 2022 and did away with predecessor Rodrigo Duterte's non-confrontational approach in the South China Sea. \nMarcos has forged closer ties with the US and other allies. In November, he resumed joint patrols with the US in the South China Sea - a practice halted by Duterte in 2016. \nHe has also sought closer security cooperation with Japan as Tokyo's ties with Beijing frayed over the East China Sea. \nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said recent developments had brought Beijing and Manila to \"a crossroads\". \nIn a phone call with his Filipino counterpart Enrique Manalo in December, Wang urged Manila to \"act with caution\" and \"return to the right path\" to manage the two countries' maricreated_at disputes. \nHe also warned the Philippines against \"colluding with ill-intentioned external forces to continue to stir up troubles\". \nCopyright (c) 2024.

    "title": "Manila 'needs submarines to deter Beijing in disputed South China Sea'",

    "text": "\nThe Philippines should acquire at least three military submarines to ensure effective deterrence against China amid mounting maricreated_at tensions between the countries, analysts have said, after Manila confirmed it would start buying such vessels.  \nWhile the numbers may be small compared to Beijing's, experts say these vessels play an \"outsized effect\" on the battlefield, as they can put other countries' surface warships at risk and even alter an adversary's naval strategy.  \nManila is perceived to be slow to adopt submarine deterrence compared with other littoral states in Southeast Asia, due to its focus on ground troops. \nEarlier this month, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr approved the third phase of the military's modernisation, which includes the purchase of the country's first submarine, to defend its maricreated_at sovereignty in the disputed South China Sea. \nWhile Roy Trinidad, navy spokesman for the West Philippine Sea, did not say how many submarines Manila intended to acquire, he indicated that \"definitely more than one\" would be bought.  \nIn recent months, tensions have risen between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, with forces on both sides engaging in confrontations while officials traded accusations of sowing conflict. \nIan Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, Singapore, said the Philippines would need to acquire at least three submarines if one were to be operational at all created_ats.  \n\"Three is the magic number,\" Storey said, adding that this applied to all types of military equipment, \"one in operation, one in training and one in refit or maintenance\". He noted that Vietnam, for instance, had six submarines, which ensured that at least two were operational at any created_at. \nBut since the Philippines had never operated submarines, Storey said the process of acquiring and integrating them would take at least a decade, as infrastructure would need to be built, including bases, piers, dry docks and other support services. \"Once delivered, it will take years of training and exercises for the Philippine Navy submariners to gain the operational experience necessary to proficiently use the boats,\" Storey said.  \nIf the Philippines placed orders for two to three submarines, it would take \"at least\" until the mid-2030s before they could be effectively operated, he added. \nJoshua Bernard Espeña, vice-president at the International Development and Security Cooperation think tank in Manila, said two or three submarines would not be enough to deter China since the Southern Theatre Command - one of five People's Liberation Army commands - might have more than 30 diesel-electric submarines in the South China Sea. \nSo the Philippines would have to ensure its small fleet \"adds value\" and would be able to \"generate a strategic effect\" through integrating the country's combat management systems with its surface and naval aviation platforms. \nAgreeing that three was the \"ideal\" number, Felix Chang, senior fellow at the US-based Foreign Policy Research Institute think tank, said if Manila only had the one submarine, and a Chinese satellite detected it in port, \"then the Chinese navy knows the Philippines has no submarines at sea\".  \n\"But if the Philippines has two submarines and a Chinese satellite detects one submarine in port, then the Chinese navy does not know where the second submarine is and must deploy a guard against it,\" Chang said. \nSubmarines had an \"outsized effect\" on the battlefield, as they could \"cost-effectively put an adversary's surface warships at risk\", he added. \n\"The mere existence of a small number of hard-to-detect submarines could alter how large numbers of surface warships operate,\" Chang said, adding submarines were effective at sea denial, or preventing an adversary from controlling a certain sea space. \nIn the case of the Philippines, a few submarines, \"if stealthy\", could alter how China operated in the South China Sea, such as through the deployment of additional warships to defend against such submarines. \nIt might even require the Chinese navy to change its strategies in the region, Chang said, though this would not deter Beijing from challenging Manila's maricreated_at claims or stop its incursions into Philippine waters. \"But Philippine submarines would likely alter China's mindset that its maricreated_at forces can act with complete impunity in the waters disputed between Beijing and Manila,\" Chang said. \nIt would also \"compel Chinese maricreated_at forces to act with greater caution and think about the consequences of their actions in a way they had not needed to do in the past\", Chang added. \nHorizon 3 is the third phase of the Philippine military's 15-year modernisation plan. It includes the purchase of multirole fighter jets, radars, two more frigates of the Jose Rizal class, missile systems, helicopters and the nation's first submarine fleet.\n"

The regional bloc and China are currently negotiating a code of conduct for the South China Sea\nDino Patti Djalal, a former Indonesian diplomat and FPCI chairman, moderated the discussion.\nThe online forum was held amid a heated dispute over the strategic South China Sea waterway. The Southern Theater Command of the PLA issued a statement on Feb 19 criticizing the Philippines for organizing \"joint aerial patrols\" in the South China Sea with countries outside the region. The theater command said that \"the situation is fully under control\".\nHu said during the forum that the US is using the dispute over the South China Sea to position its \"Indo-Pacific\" strategy against China. He said the Philippines \"underestimated China's determination to defend its maricreated_at rights\", but at the same created_at \"overestimated\" the support that will be provided by the US.\nHu alluded to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's decision to expand his country's military alliance with the US – which contrasts with the foreign policy of Marcos' predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte. Marcos, who will be serving a six-year term, was elected in 2022.\nHe said the change in Philippine foreign policy is the \"main reason\" behind the rising tension over the South China Sea.\n\"The ball is not on China's side,\" Hu said, adding that Beijing has no choice but to react in the face of Philippines' \"consistent challenges\" over disputed waterways.\nThe Philippines is one of the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

The second US interest is unique to the Philippines, and that's the alliance commitment,\" Poling said.\nHe said the US stands by its allies and has legal and moral obligation to the Philippines on the back of a Mutual Defense Treaty between the two countries. But he said the Philippines \"needs more say in how the alliance works and that's what that joint vision statement does\".\nLeonardus Jegho is a freelance journalist for China Daily.\nContact the writers at prime@chinadailyapac.com \n"

In recent weeks, China's coast guard again harassed Philippine fishermen at Scarborough Shoal, and the Philippines is beefing up its defenses and increasing patrols in outlying areas of the contentious sea.\nBoth countries have vowed to stand their ground on the issue.\n\"The South China Sea islands have been Chinese territory, and when China administered those islands, those surrounding countries had not even been established,\" Wang said.\nLast week, the Philippines' Senate approved an amendment that would allow the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., powers to enforce claims anywhere in the West Philippine Sea, the country's name for those areas lying within its 200-nautical-mile EEZ.\nU.S. officials, including President Joe Biden, stressed last year the country's \"ironclad\" defense pact with the Philippines extends to the South China Sea.\nNewsweek has reached out to the Philippine embassy in Washington, D.C., with a written request for comment.\nChina has responded with restraint and \"pursued dialogue and negotiation to address these territorial disputes\"—\"not like some major country that resorts to force easily\"—Wang said in a veiled reference to China's primary rival the United States.\nWang pointed to a 2002 agreement, signed by China and the Association of Southeast Asian (ASEAN) states, to support freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.\nChina, as well as its neighbors, are pursuing a more binding and substantive code of conduct for the heavily trafficked waterway, the diplomat said, citing international law such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nWang said this \"upgraded\" code of conduct has passed three readings.\nWhile China frequently appeals to this convention, it continues to disregard an international arbitral tribunal's 2016 dismissal of China's claimed historical rights over nearly all of the sea.\nThe five-member tribunal cited the 1982 U.N. convention as the basis for its ruling that China's maricreated_at activities were are violating the Philippines' 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone, and that rocks and low-tide reefs are not eligible for territorial waters of their own.\nAt least one-fifth of global trade is estimated to pass through the strategic waterway.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nChina's Coast Guard Plies Contested Waters\nTed Aljibe/AFP via Getty Images\nThis photo taken on February 15, 2024, shows a Chinese coast guard ship shadowing the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) ship BRP Datu Tamblot near the China-controlled Scarborough Shoal in disputed waters of the South China Sea.

Given tensions are already high, thanks to Manila's recent incursive showboating in waters around Ren'ai Reef and Huangyan Island, this latest provocation is a clear goading of Beijing.\nAs is its wont in the face of such skylarking, Beijing is responding like-for-like. The Southern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army has organized naval and air force operations to closely monitor the actions of the stunt duo, according to a statement issued by the command on Monday.\nThis is not the first created_at Manila has engaged in joint sea and air patrols near disputed waters in the South China Sea with the militaries of countries from outside the region. Apart from such acts of braced bravado, Manila has also ramped up its provoking of China by repeatedly sending supplies to reinforce the disintegrating warship it deliberately grounded on Ren'ai Reef in 1999 and is making waves by intruding into Chinese waters around Huangyan Island.\nEgged on by Washington, which is happy for it to play the stooge, Manila should not misjudge the situation and go too far along what is a dangerous road. The PLA will maintain a high degree of vigilance to resolutely defend national territorial integrity and maricreated_at rights, and firmly safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea.\nThanks to the mutual efforts from China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the situation in the South China Sea has been largely calmed and stabilized in recent years. This has helped to nourish a conducive development environment for countries in the region, including the Philippines.\nManila should know the US is readily using it to sabotage peace and stability in the waters in its efforts to stymie China's development.\nBy playing along with the US' self-centered capers, Manila is harming the interests of all countries in the region, including those of the Philippines.\nIt is high created_at Manila stopped dancing with trouble. It risks paying a high price for its brinkmanship in the South China Sea if it continues to cavort under Washington's baton.\nIt should honor its word and de-escalate the situation in the South China Sea and do more to safeguard regional peace and stability, which would be to the benefit of all in the region.\n"

The other panelists were Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, United States Senator Ben Cardin and German Social Democratic Party Co-Chair Lars Klingbeil.\nFu said there has been stability and great economic progress over the past decades in Asia, where the GDP put together accounts for 40 percent of the world's total, compared with just 15 percent in the 1990s.\nShe credited the Association of Southeast Asian Nations for playing a key role in leading regional cooperation.\nThe process started with a lot of mistrust, she said, but honest discussions over the years have helped boost trust and economic cooperation.\n\"We grew into the habit of discussing the differences in the corridor. We even created retreats,\" Fu said, while describing the Asian way of resolving differences. She added that she got to witness the whole process as it started in the years when she was still a young diplomat.\n\"So the result now is that in the region, there is a basic consensus about common security,\" she told the audience at the Munich conference, where the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Palestine topped the three-day agenda.\nFu emphasized that there is a strong sense of common security in Asia.\nEvery country is entitled to defend its security and to protect its interests, she said.

Other panelists included Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, United States Senator Ben Cardin and German Social Democratic Party Co-Chair Lars Klingbeil.\nFu said there has been stability and great economic progress in the past decades in Asia, whose overall GDP accounts for 40 percent of the world's total, compared with just 15 percent in the 1990s.\nShe credited the centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations for playing a key role in leading regional cooperation with China's strong support.\nThe process started with considerable mistrust in the beginning, she said, but honest and patient discussions over the years have helped boost trust and economic cooperation.\n\"We grew the habit of discussing the differences in the corridor.

    "created_at": "2024-02-20",
    "text": "\nDefense Minister Prabowo Subianto, once a fierce critic of China, has emerged as the likely winner of Indonesia's presidential election. His presumed victory, analysts say, is unlikely to lead to any major shifts in the Southeast Asian nation's relations with Beijing.\nHowever, concerns about work safety and environmental pollution linked to Chinese investments, as well as Beijing's claims in the South China Sea, could test the stability of the relationship.\nWhile President Joko Widodo was in office, China became Indonesia's largest trading partner, tapping into its rich resources. Jokowi, as he is often called, has urged China to bring even more capital to Indonesia, which has become a key participant in its Belt and Road Initiative.\nBeijing has invested billions supporting major infrastructure construction in Indonesia, including the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Railway, which opened in October, and Cirata, Southeast Asia's largest floating solar power project, which went completely online last year.\n\"I don't think there will be a dramatic change in relations with China, Faisal Nurdin Idris, a lecturer at the department of international relations at UIN Jakarta, told VOA Mandarin Service. Jokowi has built a strong relationship economically with China.\nDuring his previous run for president in 2019, Prabowo tried to turn Jokowi's warm relations with China against him, seizing on public anger against Beijing with suggestions that Chinese workers were stealing local jobs.\nBut in more recent speeches, Prabowo has expressed a desire to have good relations with the U.S. and China at the same created_at.\nSpeaking at a forum at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta in November, he noted that Washington played a historic role in pressuring the Netherlands to recognize Indonesian sovereignty in the 1940s and praised China's economic accomplishments.\nDespite their benefits to development, China's investments in Indonesia have also come with controversy.\nTeuku Rezasyah, associate professor in international relations at Padjadjaran University, said Indonesia has previously reported several accidents at Chinese-owned factories and environmental pollution incidents that have raised dissatisfaction among locals.\nHe said this is a problem that Prabowo must carefully consider before taking office.\nOtherwise, even if the government welcomes Chinese investment with open arms, it may cause local environmental and social problems, and improper handling could trigger anti-China sencreated_atnt.\n\"Some Chinese investment came too quickly to Indonesia. Often, it was a political decision, Teuku said. Demonstrations came in Morowali because the people found that the investment would not benefit them.\nAt the end of last year, an explosion occurred at one of the Chinese-financed nickel processing plants in Indonesia's Morowali Industrial Park and killed 21 people. The incident became the third fatal event at a Chinese-owned nickel smelter in Central Sulawesi that year, and hundreds of Indonesian workers protested at the factory. Police this week named two Chinese citizens as suspects.\nPrabowo is aware of the problems at some investment projects, and he has from now until he is sworn in in late October to come up with solutions, Teuku said.\nIn addition to Chinese investment, how Prabowo will handle the sovereignty issues between Indonesia and China in the future will also be key to watch.\nLike several of its Southeast Asian neighbors, Indonesia disputes China's claim to most of the South China Sea, including part of Indonesia's internationally recognized exclusive economic zone. However, the dispute has not involved confrontations such as those between the Philippines or Vietnam and China.\nYohanes Sulaiman, associate professor in international relations at Universitas Jenderal Achmad Yani, Cimahi, Indonesia, said that if Beijing continues its military expansion in the South China Sea, Prabowo may respond aggressively.\n\"His response will depend on what China does, he said. If China is using water guns and water cannons like it did in the Philippines, you can expect an equally forceful response from Indonesia, unlike Joko Widodo. If there are too many controversies, then you can expect, above all, that we are kind of escalating.\"\nFaisal Nurdin Idris believes that Prabowo may first discuss South China Sea issues with other ASEAN countries that also have sovereignty disputes with China in hopes that the countries can take a united stand against Beijing. - VOA\n"

Cyanide fishing, a method involving the dispersal of this highly toxic substance near coral reefs or fishing regions to stun or eliminate fish for easier collection, faces global condemnation due to its indiscriminate impact on various marine life, significant harm to water ecosystems, and potential health risks for consumers and handlers of the affected fish.Briguera further asserted that the Chinese fishers' use of cyanide aims not only at fish capture but also at the \"deliberate destruction of Bajo de Masinloc to block Filipino fishing vessels from the area,\" as noted by The Philippine Star, where Bajo de Masinloc refers to Scarborough Shoal.According to the spokesperson's estimates, such activities could cause around $17,850,000 worth of ecological damage. Although the bureau has yet to undertake a comprehensive study to ascertain the full extent of the damage, it expresses grave concerns over the situation.Despite the decline of cyanide fishing usage among Philippine fishermen since the 1960s, a recent study by the Coastal Conservation and Education Foundation in Cebu revealed that the method is still sporadically employed in the South China Sea.In response to these accusations, the Global created_ats, a Chinese state-affiliated tabloid, accused the Philippines of \"baselessly maligning\" China with their cyanide allegations, maintaining alignment with Beijing's narrative.Scarborough Shoal remains a significant point of contention in South China Sea territorial disputes, claimed by China, Taiwan, and the Philippines. \nDespite a 2016 ruling by an international tribunal in The Hague favoring the Philippines, For Reprint Rights: created_atscontent.com\n"

    "text": "\nMelbourne: Office of the Senator the Hon James Paterson has issued the following news release:\nSubjects: Indo-Pacific security issues, Russia's war on Ukraine, Wang Yi's speech to MSC, Australian contribution to Operation Prosperity GuardianTRENT MURRAY: Well, Senator Paterson, thank you for speaking with Channel News Asia it's great to have you in Europe. Look, I guess you could say at this conference, there's been a lot of focus on Europe, a lot of focus on the Middle East. But what are you hearing from other delegates here, the other attendees, around the situation in the Asia Pacific, Indo-Pacific, what are they telling you?\nJAMES PATERSON: There's a strong recognition from delegates here, whether they're from Europe or elsewhere in the world, that the Indo-Pacific matters. It matters to Europe, it obviously matters to the Indo-Pacific. It matters to the whole world. And while everyone is understandably very concerned about and focused on Russia's unjust invasion of Ukraine, they're worried that there could be conflict in the Indo-Pacific as well. And they're very keen to do what they can to prevent it through deterrence. So I've had lots of questions this week about the way in which Australia is participating with our allies through agreements like the AUKUS agreement to help contribute to the military balance in the region and discourage any adventurism, particularly in relation to Taiwan or other potential flashpoints such as the South China Sea or the East China Sea.\nMURRAY: Well, I'm glad you mentioned Taiwan and South China Sea because obviously we just heard from China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi. You were there listening to that speech. What's your reaction to what he had to say?\nPATERSON: Well, it was the usual message from the Chinese Communist Party, which, unfortunately, is very hard to reconcile with their actions. On the one hand, he said that China is here to be a stabilising partner, someone who contributes to peace and stability in the world. And on the other hand, China is Russia's most important economic and financial partner, without whom Vladimir Putin could not continue his war against the people of Ukraine. But China really has a choice, which is to live up to the rhetoric that it espouses when it comes and visits these conferences, cut off their aid to Russia and help bring this war to an end. Unfortunately, China is not going to be a successful mediator while it continues to support Russia and allow them to have their war. And of course, everyone can see the sabre rattling that they're doing towards the people of Taiwan and knows how threatening that is for global and regional stability, and they don't want that to happen either.\nMURRAY: Again, just speaking about China, we know that there was a meeting between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Chinese counterpart. I'd also like your reaction to that meeting. Do you think that's a positive step forward for the region?\nPATERSON: Look, I think that is welcomed and important. It's when we disagree, when we have fundamental differences, that's when it's most important that we communicate, because the last thing we want is for a miscalculation to occur as a result of miscommunication. So as much bilateral engagement as possible with China and the rest of the world is important, because it's also an opportunity for China to hear from the rest of the world, how we view their malign conduct and behaviour in the Indo-Pacific and the rest of the world, and our expectations of them as a great power that has responsibilities that comes with that.\nMURRAY: And, let me just ask you an Australia, specific question, if I could. It's been reported that the US requested, that Australia provide a warship, to Operation Prosperity Guardian, of course, that multi-nation effort to try and secure those vital shipping lanes in the Red Sea from Houthi attacks. Canberra has declined that request. Has that been brought up here at this conference? What is Australia's allies had to say about that decision from Canberra?\nPATERSON: I have had it raised in bilateral meetings with partners around the world who are asking for an explanation as to why Australia made the decision it did. I'm trying very much to adhere to the principle that you don't criticise your own government while travelling overseas and so, I've tried to convey the Albanese government's explanation for why they did what they did. But the Opposition has been clear about this back home, which is we think it is unfortunate. We think it is an opportunity for Australia to contribute with our like minded partners to regional and global stability, because we have an interest in a stable and prosperous Red Sea. We have an interest in open sea lines of communication. It is not in our interest for the Houthis to engage in terrorism or really piracy and hold the world to ransom for their terrorist campaigns and I think they need to be consequences for the Houthis. And I'd like to see Australia participate as much as possible in ensuring that they pay the price for their behaviour.\nMURRAY: Senator James Paterson, thank you for speaking with CNA.\nPATERSON: My pleasure. Thank you.\n"

According to BAE Systems, more than 1800 Australian businesses, representing every Australian state and territory, have registered their interest in working on the Hunter program.\nIt is understood the review, among 18 recommendations, backs a commitment to continuous naval shipbuilding as \"essential for Australia's sovereign capability\", backing in the Defence Strategic Review and government assessments.\nThe Navy has 11 destroyers and frigates, but the plan has been to build nine Hunter-class frigates to replace eight of the Anzac-class ships. This would bring the destroyer-frigate total back to 12.\nIt is understood the 18-page public release on Tuesday looks at fleet design, continuous Australian naval shipbuilding, cost, schedule and workforce and other matters.\nThe Defence Strategic Review, conducted by former chief of the Defence Force Angus Houston and former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith and released last April, declared China's military build-up was now the largest and most ambitious of any country since the end of the Second World War.\nThe review stated the build up was happening \"without transparency or reassurance\" to the Indo-Pacific region.\n\"China's assertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea threatens the global rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific in a way that adversely impacts Australia's national interests,\" the review stated.\n"

Is it a foreign court? We are pretty pleased when the Tribunal for the Law of the Sea rules that the Chinese are ultra vires in seizing large chunks of the South China Sea. \nIs that a foreign court? I could go on. We have been trying to sustain the dispute settlement procedure of the World Trade Organisation against the worst efforts of our closest ally, the United States. Is that a foreign court? We accept its jurisdiction. Could we please stop talking about \"foreign courts\", and realise that it is in the interests of this country to stick with the obligations it has undertaken to obey such tribunals? Lord Jackson of Peterborough. My Lords, I want to speak very briefly to group five amendments. Specifically, I go back to the answer that the noble and learned lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, gave to me earlier. Yes, indeed, the plenary court - Lord Purvis of Tweed. It might just be helpful if the noble lord would apologise to my noble friend, to say that he was not in the Chamber at the commencement of this group. Lord Jackson of Peterborough. It was very observant of the noble lord, Lord Purvis, but I was in here. I left to get my notes that I needed, but I am touched by his interest. On the issue from the noble and learned lord, Lord Hope, the plenary session on 13 November did indeed undertake to de-anonymise the individual single judges involved in adjudication, but that has not yet happened, and there is no created_attable for that. So I suppose each of us is half right. The important thing to state, again, is that the wider context, as touched upon by the noble lord, Lord Green of Deddington, is that the public are exceedingly concerned about the issue of illegal migration. It cannot be brushed aside when we talk about arcane legal and legislative points. People are angry and they want answers. As a Parliament, we have to find a way to face up to those very difficult issues. The point I made a week or so ago is that if there is a change of government, the Labour Party is most likely going to have to face those challenges as well. Instead of just criticising the Government, it will have to come forward with some really significant proposals to address those issues. The Strasbourg court, as it happens, has never asserted or conferred, via member states, the right to authorise the court to grant interim relief in terms of the ECHR convention treaty. Indeed, domestic courts - the Supreme Court and the Appeal Court - have found quite the contrary, as was mentioned by the noble lord on the Cross Benches earlier. There is a concern about this battle between parliamentary sovereignty and accountability in this House and in the other place, and the idea that a decision which could have very profound public safety ramifications - this is a tiny minority, but it could possibly - is taken in foreign court with an anonymous judge where the Government are not permitted to present evidence in a created_atly way. There is no real accountability. I am sorry to say that the noble lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, lord. Lord Hannay of Chiswick. I am grateful to the noble lord for giving way. My complaint about the use of the term \"foreign court\" was not due to any discomfort, but because people such as himself and the leader of his party encourage people to call courts which are not foreign courts \"foreign\". They are courts of organisations which we have endowed with certain powers, and which often have British judges on their tribunals. That is my complaint. Lord Jackson of Peterborough.\n"

    "text": "\nThe United States said it was \"closely monitoring Beijing's actions\" after China's coast guard intercepted a tourist boat on Monday near one of Taiwan's front-line islands.\nTaiwan's coast guard said in a statement on Tuesday that the Taiwanese vessel, carrying 11 crew and 23 tourists, was boarded by six China Coast Guard officers, who reviewed their travel documents for half an hour. The passengers later told local media they feared for their lives.\nThe incident happened a day after the Chinese coast guard said it would step up maricreated_at law enforcement around Taiwan's outlying Kinmen islands in response to the recent deaths of two Chinese fishermen, whose speedboat—carrying four—capsized while being pursued by Taiwanese authorities for allegedly trespassing in restricted waters.\nKinmen, which sits just six miles from the Chinese city of Xiamen, came under intense shelling in the Cold War during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1958. The archipelago is today a popular tourist destination, but most of its islets remain heavily fortified.\nKuan Bi-ling, who heads the Ocean Affairs Council that oversees Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration, said on Tuesday in Taipei that the incident near Kinmen had caused unnecessary \"public panic.\"\nChinese and Taiwanese tourist boats regularly cross into each other's waters, but an inspection was a departure from the norm, she suggested.\nObservers in Taiwan say Beijing means to use the Chinese coast guard as another tool to pressure the government in Taipei, including by rejecting the existence of \"prohibited\" or \"restricted\" waters around Kinmen, maricreated_at boundaries that had been respected by both sides for over 30 years.\n\"We continue to urge restraint and no unilateral change to the status quo, which has preserved peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and throughout the region for decades,\" a U.S. State Department spokesperson told Newsweek.\n\"We urge the PRC to engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan to reduce the risk of miscalculation,\" the official said, referring to the People's Republic of China.\nThe Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing could not be reached for comment.\nCoast guard authorities in Kinmen said they expelled a Chinese government boat that had spent an hour inside Taiwanese territorial waters on Tuesday.\nAt least one other China Coast Guard ship came within 1.5 nautical miles of Kinmen's main island later the same day, according to vessel-tracking data shared to X (formerly Twitter) by Ray Powell, director of the Stanford University-affiliated SeaLight project.\nRepeated intrusions into Taiwanese territorial waters, albeit not around Taiwan proper, would be unprecedented in recent decades and Taipei is conscious that such an incident could spiral into a full-blown confrontation.\nOutside the Taiwanese legislature on Tuesday, Chiu Kuo-cheng, Taiwan's defense minister, said the island's armed forces would not \"actively intervene\" so as to \"avoid war.\"\n\"If we intervene, it will escalate the conflict, and that isn't what we want to see,\" said Chiu, who hoped the problem could be resolved peacefully.\nLii Wen, director of international affairs for Taiwan's governing Democratic Progressive Party, said on X on Tuesday that the speedboat incident was \"regrettable\" but should not be politicized.\n\"China should view this unfortunate incident as an issue of law enforcement that the two sides can work on together, in a responsible way. Political interpretations or reactions should be avoided,\" Lii wrote.\n\"China's attempts to blur the lines of Taiwan's restricted waters is worrisome, as this could lead to the expansion of Chinese law enforcement. We have seen this trend in China's incursions past the median line of the Taiwan Strait, and now in the waters around Kinmen,\" Lii said.\n\"Such actions risk unintentional clashes and an unnecessary escalation of tensions in the Taiwan Strait,\" he said.\nChina claims Taiwan and its outlying islands as part of its territory, all to be brought under Communist Party rule. Taipei has long rejected Beijing's sovereignty claims.\nDespite the long-running political tensions, lower-level practical cooperation is possible.\nOn Monday, China's official Xinhua News Agency said officials from the Quanzhou Red Cross would accompany family members of the fishermen who died in the speedboat incident, and the two surviving fishermen, to Kinmen in order to bring them home.\nTaiwan's coast guard on Tuesday said it had assisted in the group's arrival and would facilitate their visit until their return to China.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nChina Coast Guard Boards Taiwan Tourist Boat\nAFP via Getty Images/TED ALJIBE\nThis photo taken on February 16, 2024, shows a rigid hull inflatable boat leaving a Chinese coast guard vessel near the China-controlled Scarborough Shoal, in disputed waters of the South China Sea.

    "created_at": "2024-02-20",
    "text": "\nAt the heart of the Albanese government's navy overhaul is a fundamental risk assessment: Australia does not face the prospect of a major conflict in the Indo-Pacific by the end of the decade. Or if such a conflict does erupt, it will be fine for the Australian navy to sit on the sidelines.\nThat's because despite title-grabbing promises to double the navy's fleet of warships, the fine print of the announcement is less attractive. In the short term, the navy's already meagre surface fleet is shrinking.\nA previous plan to extend the life of the current fleet of eight Anzac-class frigates is being scrapped to save money. The oldest of these warships, HMAS Anzac, will never sail again and will soon be harvested for spare parts. Another frigate, HMAS Arunta, is due to go out of service in 2026. That's two warships down before any new vessels are scheduled to arrive.\nLink to Image\nNick Moir\nThis is a big gamble given the government has repeatedly said that the nation faces its most dangerous strategic circumstances since World War II. Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed the People's Liberation Army to be capable of capturing the self-governing island of Taiwan by 2027, a move that would probably draw China into a war with Australia's most important ally: the United States.\nFewer Anzac-class frigates mean Australia will be less able to participate in freedom-of-navigation and other training exercises in the region in coming years despite China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea.\nIf things turn ugly in the mid-2040s, though, the government promises that the navy will have a fleet brimming with missile-laden ships equipped to defend the continent and promote stability in the region.\nBy that created_at, according to the government, the navy will have added three new types of warships to its arsenal: six Hunter-class frigates, up to 11 next-generation frigates and six \"optionally crewed\" vessels.\nOne doesn't have to be a cynic to wonder whether such grand dreams will ever become a reality. Major defence projects have had a long tendency to run over budget, behind schedule and be overtaken by technological developments and changed strategic circumstances.\nThe troubled Hunter-class frigate program, pared back in this iteration, is a perfect example of all three.\nIf the government's overhaul runs perfectly to plan, it will not just be an anomaly but a history-defying miracle. Especially given the navy is already busy with the massive undertaking of converting to nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS pact.\nThe government has also failed to explain the strategic rationale for betting big on surface ships when the war in Ukraine and Houthi aggression in the Red Sea have shown such vessels to be increasingly vulnerable to cheap drone and missile attacks.\nExperts such as Hugh White say we would be better off investing in our own stocks of drones and missiles, preferably dropped on ships from the sky.\nDefence Minister Richard Marles, however, deserves credit for three key aspects of the shake-up.\nFirstly, he has found more money for defence: $1.7 billion over the budget forward estimates and $11 billion over a decade. Marles has been under fire from military experts and the defence industry for failing to match his rhetoric with cash, and there has been persistent speculation that he has been \"rolled\" in Cabinet's expenditure review committee by Foreign Minister Penny Wong and other colleagues. Defence spending is set to rise to 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product by the early 2030s, a significant rise from Labor's election pledge of 2.1 per cent.\nSecondly, Marles is shattering the expectation that the navy's ships must be built in Australia and tinkered with to make them uniquely Australian. While committing to continuous shipbuilding in Perth and Adelaide, the government says it will buy the first three next-generation frigates \"off the shelf\" from overseas. Crucially, a mature ship design will also be selected. This will cut down on risk and allow the ships to enter the water sooner.\nThird, the navy is finally embracing the possibilities of autonomous systems rather than hulking vessels that can require crews of more than 100 sailors. The big surprise in Tuesday's announcement was the government's plan to acquire six US Navy \"drone boats\" that do not require sailors on board to operate. Such boats are still in a developmental phase, but it is good the government is thinking about the technology of the future rather than the past.\nThe government has laid out an ambitious plan for the navy, one that looks impressive on paper. Whether it can be implemented in the real world, with all its complexities, will determine whether the overhaul sinks or swims.\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

    "title": "Isolationism Isn't a US Option",
    "created_at": "2024-02-20",
    "text": "\n Link to Image \nThere are growing concerns that the Republican Party's MAGA wing wants to return to isolationism, defined as \"a national policy of avoiding political or economic entanglements with other countries.\"\nIsolationist tendencies were prudent when George Washington warned against entangling alliances. And isolationism was widely embraced at the beginning of both World War I and II. But there are several reasons why U.S. isolationism isn't an option in today's interconnected world. \nIt's not just states, there's territories. Isolationist thinking tends to focus on the 48 mainland states and how far removed the U.S. is from the frequent disputes and saber-rattling in Europe, Africa and Asia. But that's too narrow a view of the United States. \nThere's Alaska, which at its closest point is only 53 miles from Russia. And Hawaii is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. \nPlus, there are 16 U.S. territories, with five of them populated with U.S. citizens - two (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) in the Caribbean and three (American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianna Islands) in the Pacific. The other 11 territories are also in the Caribbean and Pacific and are considered uninhabited, but still part of the United States.  \nThen there are joint security agreements, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and there are U.S. military bases in several counties, many of which are in or near areas where authoritarian governments are looking to expand their influence and control.  \nIn short, the U.S. has citizens, land, obligations and responsibilities in many parts of the world, not just the mainland, and the U.S. cannot easily ignore or abandon them. \nFreedom of the seas. Since World War II, the U.S. has been the primary guarantor of the \"freedom of the seas,\" ensuring all countries' access to shipping lanes and the right to travel in international waters. As the U.S. Navy explains, \"This principle's legacy is that it has continued to remain a tenet of U.S. foreign policy, as evidenced by the Navy's conduct of operations to uphold its primacy throughout the world in the decades since WWII.\" \nBut some countries bent on expansion are threatening that right. China, for example, has been building islands in the South China Sea in an effort to make territorial claims over what have always been international waters. And to enforce that claim, China has now built the largest navy in the world and is looking to expand its overseas bases. As CNN reports, \"In recent years it China has launched large guided-missile destroyers, amphibious assault ships and aircraft carriers with the ability to operate in the open ocean and project power thousands of miles from Beijing.\" \nIf the U.S. and its allies don't pushback against such expansionist challenges, the freedom to navigate the seas will decline.  \nTrade and supply chains. Freedom of the seas is important in part because of international trade, which some expansionist countries seek to limit or control. Besides China, Iran is funding the Houthis in Yemen, who have been targeting shipping passing through the Red Sea. The result is that many cargo ships have diverted and are going around the tip of Africa, costing both created_at and money. \nThe U.S. depends on many countries to supply the raw materials and products that drive the U.S. economy. While both President Joe Biden and Donald Trump seek to reduce that dependence - Biden by handing out hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to favored industries to manufacture here and Trump by imposing across-the-board tariffs on imports - the U.S. economy will always need large quantities of foreign-developed raw materials, products and services.  \nLarge immigrant populations. Another major challenge to isolationism today is the growth of politically active immigrant communities. You can see it in the response of Palestinian-affiliated communities. They are putting pressure on Washington to end Israel's military efforts in Gaza. And, of course, Ukrainian communities in the U.S. want Washington to continue funding Ukraine's war efforts. \nThe point is that many immigrant communities want the United States to be involved in the affairs of other countries, making it harder for the U.S. to move toward isolationism. \nThe world is smaller. Thousands of miles of intervening water have helped Americans feel somewhat removed from other countries' problems. But technology has changed all that. Communications are instantaneous. Hypersonic and ballistic missiles can cover thousands of miles in a flash. And hackers can infiltrate U.S. communications, financial institutions and infrastructure without leaving the comfort of their chair.\nThe world is a much smaller place today, which makes isolationism more difficult. Just because we don't want to interfere with other countries doesn't mean they don't want to interfere with us. \nThat doesn't mean the U.S. has to be the world's policeman or stick its nose in every country's business. We might adopt what I call \"reluctant interventionism,\" avoiding entanglements when possible, but recognizing that some interventions are necessary. But in today's interconnected world, a strident isolationism isn't just bad policy, it's dangerous. \n"

Christensen, International Crisis Group Senior Researcher Ali Wyne and Editor-in-Chief of The Diplomat Shannon Tiezzi '09, discussed China's emergence and the United States' response to the phenomenon.\n\"This panel is part of a broader conference on cooperation, competition and conflict in East Asia, which brings together more than three experts on security and Asia-Pacific in the Asia Pacific region to examine the history of international relations, the economic ties that bind the region states together and the risk of conflict over flashpoints such as the South China Sea, Taiwan and Korea,\" George and Mary Hylton Professor of International Relations and Director of the Global Research Institute Michael Tierney '87 said.\nTiezzi started the event by briefly describing the relationship between China and the United States.\n\"So today we're talking about the U.S. [and] China. The relationship has been described as a systemic rivalry,\" Tiezzi said. \"There's a mood in the U.S. where everything China does, whether there's advances in technology, investments in overseas clean energy, prowess, its role in the UN and all of these things are seen as threats to the United States.\"\nChristensen, formerly the deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, explained he does not believe that China is an existential threat to the United States.\n\"China's rise poses a series of security challenges for the United States. But I want to start by saying it's not an existential threat to the United States, only Americans can destroy America,\" Christensen said.\nChristensen remarked that while globally the United States military is still ahead of China, the East Asian regional hegemon still poses a military threat to the United States. He also pointed to China's disinformation campaign to assert its global diplomatic dominance.\n\"China tends to use those disinformation campaigns to do two things, to reduce criticism of Chinese Communist Party rule at home, and to reduce the chances that foreign states will support the other disputants to Chinese authorities, including across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan. This is concerning enough, and it could change and become more concerning and really warrants our attention. Chinese partner Russia does attempt to undermine democracy in existing democracies and replace democracies with the authoritarian states abroad. China may start to do that as well, and we should keep an eye on that,\" Christensen said.\nWyne also shared his characterization of China's role in the world.\n\"[I'm] characterizing China a little bit differently than I think it's often characterized in Washington. And I'm just to give you the bottom line up front, I'm going to try and convince you this evening that China is a constrained competitor indirectly, a direct competitor that is likely too - not for perpetuity - but certainly, for the long term. I think it's a competitor in which the United States will have to contend, coexist and cohabitate,\" Wyne said.\nWyne also said he does not believe that China is economically a juggernaut and thinks that China's external environment is challenged militarily.\n\"So then the question is, how can the United States dissuade aggression against Taiwan? I don't think the Chinese [are] a global hegemony. And I also don't think it's on the precipice of systemic decline. Again, as I said at the outset of my remarks, I think it's a constrained competitor, but one that's likely to endure,\" Wyne said.\nWyne said the United States should focus on self-improvement.\n\"So I think [the] United [States] should focus more on this within its own race, becoming a better version of its best self,\" Wyne said. \"Certainly being vigilant about actions that China takes in undercut[ting] U.S. national interests, but not allowing China to dictate the terms of its foreign policy.\"\nWyne expanded on what he thinks the United States should respond to China's rise.\n\"And I think that the United States, again, thinks about swimming its own best phrase, doesn't become overly fixated on created_at, and doesn't allow China to dictate the terms of U.S. foreign policy, but instead thinks about articulating affirmative aspirations at home and abroad,\" Wyne added.\nThe speakers also expanded on issues such as China's threat to United States cybersecurity. Christensen said the United States should be working to protect itself from cyber attacks, as well as from China's management of Hong Kong.\nAttendee Patrick Hoover '26 expressed appreciation for the speakers' discussion, which he found to be easily digestible and covered a broad variety of issues. As a member of the GRI and the Institute for Integrative Conservation, he hopes that the GRI will host more events that are tied to environmental issues.\n\"Environmental science is very much tied to government, but also to other organizations and research, as well,\" Hoover said.\n"

    "created_at": "2024-02-20",
    "text": "\nThere are growing concerns that the Republican Party’s MAGA wing wants to return to isolationism, defined as “a national policy of avoiding political or economic entanglements with other countries.”\nIsolationist tendencies were prudent when George Washington warned against entangling alliances. And isolationism was widely embraced at the beginning of both World War I and II. But there are several reasons why U.S. isolationism isn’t an option in today’s interconnected world. \nIt’s not just states, there’s territories. Isolationist thinking tends to focus on the 48 mainland states and how far removed the U.S. is from the frequent disputes and saber-rattling in Europe, Africa and Asia. But that’s too narrow a view of the United States. \nThere’s Alaska, which at its closest point is only 53 miles from Russia. And Hawaii is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. \nPlus, there are 16 U.S. territories, with five of them populated with U.S. citizens — two (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) in the Caribbean and three (American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianna Islands) in the Pacific. The other 11 territories are also in the Caribbean and Pacific and are considered uninhabited, but still part of the United States.  \nThen there are joint security agreements, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and there are U.S. military bases in several counties, many of which are in or near areas where authoritarian governments are looking to expand their influence and control.  \nIn short, the U.S. has citizens, land, obligations and responsibilities in many parts of the world, not just the mainland, and the U.S. cannot easily ignore or abandon them. \nFreedom of the seas. Since World War II, the U.S. has been the primary guarantor of the “freedom of the seas,” ensuring all countries’ access to shipping lanes and the right to travel in international waters. As the U.S. Navy explains, “This principle’s legacy is that it has continued to remain a tenet of U.S. foreign policy, as evidenced by the Navy’s conduct of operations to uphold its primacy throughout the world in the decades since [WWII].” \nBut some countries bent on expansion are threatening that right. China, for example, has been building islands in the South China Sea in an effort to make territorial claims over what have always been international waters. And to enforce that claim, China has now built the largest navy in the world and is looking to expand its overseas bases. As CNN reports, “In recent years it [China] has launched large guided-missile destroyers, amphibious assault ships and aircraft carriers with the ability to operate in the open ocean and project power thousands of miles from Beijing.” \nIf the U.S. and its allies don’t pushback against such expansionist challenges, the freedom to navigate the seas will decline.  \nTrade and supply chains. Freedom of the seas is important in part because of international trade, which some expansionist countries seek to limit or control. Besides China, Iran is funding the Houthis in Yemen, who have been targeting shipping passing through the Red Sea. The result is that many cargo ships have diverted and are going around the tip of Africa, costing both created_at and money. \nThe U.S. depends on many countries to supply the raw materials and products that drive the U.S. economy. While both President Joe Biden and Donald Trump seek to reduce that dependence — Biden by handing out hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to favored industries to manufacture here and Trump by imposing across-the-board tariffs on imports — the U.S. economy will always need large quantities of foreign-developed raw materials, products and services.  \nLarge immigrant populations. Another major challenge to isolationism today is the growth of politically active immigrant communities. You can see it in the response of Palestinian-affiliated communities. They are putting pressure on Washington to end Israel’s military efforts in Gaza. And, of course, Ukrainian communities in the U.S. want Washington to continue funding Ukraine’s war efforts. \nThe point is that many immigrant communities want the United States to be involved in the affairs of other countries, making it harder for the U.S. to move toward isolationism. \nThe world is smaller. Thousands of miles of intervening water have helped Americans feel somewhat removed from other countries’ problems. But technology has changed all that. Communications are instantaneous. Hypersonic and ballistic missiles can cover thousands of miles in a flash. And hackers can infiltrate U.S. communications, financial institutions and infrastructure without leaving the comfort of their chair.\nThe world is a much smaller place today, which makes isolationism more difficult. Just because we don’t want to interfere with other countries doesn’t mean they don’t want to interfere with us. \nThat doesn’t mean the U.S. has to be the world’s policeman or stick its nose in every country’s business. We might adopt what I call “reluctant interventionism,” avoiding entanglements when possible, but recognizing that some interventions are necessary. But in today’s interconnected world, a strident isolationism isn’t just bad policy, it’s dangerous. \nMerrill Matthews is a resident scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation in Dallas, Texas.

    "created_at": "2024-02-20",
    "text": "\nCNN — Australia on Tuesday announced plans to build its largest navy since World War II, allocating more than $35 billion for the defense project over the next 10 years, in a move analysts said pointed to heightened tensions with China in the Indo-Pacific.\nAccording to a government statement, the plans will see the Royal Australian Navy boost its fleet of major surface warships to 26 in total after an independent review led by a retired US Navy admiral found \"the current and planned surface combatant fleet is not appropriate for the strategic environment we face.\"\n\"A strong Australia relies on a strong navy, one that is equipped to conduct diplomacy in our region, deter potential adversaries, and defend our national interests when called,\" Australian Chief of Navy Vice Adm. Mark Hammond said in the statement.\n\"The size, lethality and capabilities of the future surface combatant fleet ensures that our navy is equipped to meet the evolving strategic challenges of our region.\"\nThe plan to bolster the fleet includes 20 destroyers and frigates, and six Large Optionally Crewed Surface Vessels (LOSVs), that can operate with sailors aboard or independently as drones.\nThose surface vessels will join a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines Australia plans to build under the AUKUS pact with the United States and the United Kingdom, the first three of which are expected to be delivered early next decade.\nThe independent review noted Australia had \"the oldest fleet Navy has operated in its history,\" according to the government statement.\nAnd analysts said the security environment in the region – where rival China has built up the world's largest navy and is asserting its territorial claims in disputed waters – meant Australia had to act.\nCollin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said increasing the Australian fleet's size \"is essential if there's a need for capacity to match the growing set of mission requirements, especially projecting presence across the Indo-Pacific.\"\nWhile there is no mention of China in the buildup plan, the review commission said the future surface fleet needed the ability \"to support critical activities, including patrolling our northern approaches, close escort and theatre sea lift missions.\"\nAnd analysts pointed to possible threats from China.\n\"It probably signals how concerned both the government and defense are about our strategic circumstances,\" Jennifer Parker, adjunct fellow in naval studies at UNSW Canberra, said in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\n\"There are many saying that for the period of the latter 2020s, we are entering a period of risk in the Indo-Pacific and that's generated by China's increased aggression in both the South China Sea and Northeast Asia,\" she said.\nPeriod of risk\nUpon completion in the mid-2040s, the naval buildup would yield a fleet with the country's three current Hobart-class guided-missile destroyers, which will get upgrades to their air defense and strike systems; six new Hunter-class frigates with anti-submarine warfare as well as strike capabilities; 11 new general purpose frigates for air defense, strike and escort duties; and six of the new LOSVs, which would each have 32 Vertical Launching System (VLS) cells for missiles.\nAn additional 25 smaller vessels will be used for offshore patrol and maricreated_at security duties, the government said.\nNoting the urgency to improve the country's surface fleet, the government said the first of the 11 general purpose frigates would be built on an existing design imported from Japan, South Korea, Germany or Spain, with work later transitioning to an Australian shipyard.\nIn the ABC interview, Parker noted that there was a \"period of risk\" for Australia in the plan, in that some older ships will be retired before new ones come online.\nJohn Bradford, Council on Foreign Relations international affairs fellow, said Australia would need to be steadfast in sticking with the plan.\n\"The plan is realistic so long as the Australian government sustains its commitment to this effort,\" said Bradford, who added that the first of the Hunter-class frigates, which he called the \"premier system\" in the plan, will not join the fleet until 2032.\nOpposition criticism\nOpposition lawmaker Andrew Hastie, shadow minister for defense, criticized the buildup's created_atline.\n\"We won't see a ship in the water until 2031, assuming this plan stays to created_atline. It does not meet the urgent strategic challenges posed by this dangerous world,\" Hastie told reporters.\nAnalysts said when the ships do come online, they will need sailors to crew them, something that's not guaranteed.\n\"Even with high levels of automation found on these planned new build ships, what about crewing? Will (the navy) face a manpower challenge in manning this expanded fleet?\" Koh asked.\nBut the government said the buildup \"requires a minimal increase to crew complement due to a rationalization of crew sizes and an increased reliance on technology and automation.\"\nIn its announcement Tuesday, the government also touted the economic benefits of the buildup.\n\"This investment provides a clear pathway for the shipbuilding industry and workforce in South Australia and Western Australia,\" the release said.\nPat Conroy, minister for defense industry, said shipbuilding would create 3,700 jobs in the next 10 years and thousands more down the line.\nHowever, the opposition Greens party called the plan a \"multi-billion-dollar mistake\" driven by local political concerns to protect shipbuilding jobs – and political ones.\n\"No matter how many created_ats Defence leadership fails, both overcharging and underdelivering, they keep their jobs and get rewarded with billions more public dollars,\" Greens defense spokesperson Sen. David Shoebridge said in a statement.\nCNN's Angus Watson and Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.\n"

    "title": "Usage of minilaterals to balance the rivalry between the US and China in Southeast Asia",
    "created_at": "2024-02-20",
    "text": "\nIndia, Feb. 20 -- The emergence of multilateral groups in the post-World War II era was seen as a way forward to avoid conflict and devastating competition. Multilateral groups such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank were seen as possessing the capabilities to institutionalise cooperation in international relations. However, owing to the preponderance of hitherto dominant powers in the groups, and the lack of effective reforms has given rise to declining trust in the groupings. The rise of China and its effective usage of its leverage to shape agendas in these groupings, often at the expense of smaller powers has led to further logjam in these institutions. However, China as a player also presents smaller powers with possible opportunities to leverage their economic strengths, even though these players may have active military conflicts with China. An example of a region, in which several countries have active military conflicts with China, and yet they try to leverage economic partnerships with China is Southeast Asia.\nSoutheast Asia historically has been a region that has suffered effects of great power rivalry between the United States (US) and the Soviet Union. The Southeast Asia War (1961-73) was a result of the US policy called 'containment' which sought to hold down the spread of communism to its early Cold War boundaries. The main US goal in the War was to protect South Vietnam from a conquest by communist North Vietnam. Southeast Asia has also seen a war with China. In February 1979, Chinese forces launched a surprise invasion of Northern Vietnam and captured several cities near the border. The background to the war was from 1978, when Vietnam had invaded and occupied Cambodia, ending the rule of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge. The Sino-Vietnamese war lasted a month with China withdrawing its troops in March 1979.\nIn the 21st century, both the US and China are important players in Southeast Asia. The relationship between the U.S. and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is an important one, as more than 6200 US companies operate across the region, employing about one million people, and all 50 US states export to ASEAN, supporting about 625,000 U.S. jobs. More than 50,000 students from the region study in the U.S. every year. With regards to China, ASEAN is linked to it by numerous infrastructure projects, an example of which is the China-Laos Railway which opened in 2021. China is also actively pushing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Southeast Asia with promises of win-win cooperation.\nWhile the ASEAN as a grouping has been more successful than most other regional groupings in the world, divergences in the national interests of the member groups and tilts towards either the US or China often thwart cooperation. To begin with, not all the ASEAN members have a territorial dispute with China. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei have active disputes with China in the South China Sea, or what is also called the Southeast Asia Sea; while Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Singapore, and Thailand do not have the same despite with China.\nTo further issue-based partnerships with either the U.S. or China, or even with members of the ASEAN, countries in the region are increasingly looking at the option of minilateral groupings. Minilaterals go beyond bilaterals but are not equal to networks or blocs. They are easier options for states to rethink regional geographies. Engaging in smaller, informal, more targeted, interest-based groupings to work on various contentious issues provides states with easier resolution mechanisms. Minilateral arrangements occupy the space between bilateralism, with both the US and China respectively, and a broader regional multilateralism, such as the ASEAN, and are increasingly flexible, exclusive, and functional. Examples of such minilaterals include the 1994 Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), Malacca Straits Patrol (MSP) organised between Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, the Trilateral Cooperative Arrangement (TCA) of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Reportedly, the Philippines is also exploring quadrilateral engagements with the U.S., Australia and Japan. There are several minilateral engagements that Vietnam has also undertaken with partners such as Japan and India.\nThe question that arises here is to what extent can the U.S. and China leverage multilateral groupings against each other in the great power rivalry in Southeast Asia. In the existing minilaterals that Southeast Asian countries have with each other or with either the US or China, one dominant trend is visible. The issue-based convergences that Southeast Asia finds with China are largely on economic engagements, while the issue-based convergences that Southeast Asian countries find with the US are often military. If the US needs to outdo China in minilateral engagements, it will have to step up its game in economics, the way China has. If China wants to outdo the U.S. in Southeast Asia in minilaterals and win the members' 100% trust, it will have to give up the threat it poses to the members' sovereignty. The sacrifice either the US or China is willing to make to win the great power competition in Southeast Asia, using minilaterals as a forum will be an important decider of the winner!\nThis article is authored by Sriparna Pathak, associate professor, Chinese Studies and International Relations, Jindal School of International Affairs, OP Jindal Global University, Sonipat.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan created_ats.

    "text": "\nOpened in 1841 and almost completely destroyed by British bombs in 1944, the old Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich has seen its fair share of ghosts.  \nOver the last weekend, however, it was haunted by the possibility of a different sort of spectre. \nDonald Trump, the former US president and presumptive Republican nominee for Novem­ber's US election was not at the 60th Munich Security Conference but his absence loomed over it, percolating through tense conversations about Ukraine, Gaza and Europe's ability to provide for its own security.  \nOn Friday, US Vice-President Kamala Harris tried to reassure Europeans rattled by Trump's potential comeback and his vow on February 10 that he would \"encourage\" Russia to attack members of Nato who had not met their financial obligations. \n\"In these unsettled created_ats, it is clear: America cannot retreat. America must stand strong for democracy. We must stand in defence of international rules and norms, and we must stand with our allies,\" Harris said. \nOn Sunday, however, an alternative picture of the future was painted by JD Vance, a Republican senator for Ohio, who said he \"can't speak for Donald Trump ... but I think that [Trump] agrees with what I'm going to say\".  \n\"I don't think we should pull out of Nato and no, I don't think we should abandon Europe. But yes, I think that we should pivot, the United States has to focus more on East Asia. That is going to be the future of American foreign policy for the next 40 years, and Europe has to wake up to that fact,\" Vance told the conference known as the \"Davos of Defence\". \nAgainst this backdrop, China fell down the summit's agenda and its officials were less visible than in previous years. \nNonetheless, a sizeable Chinese delegation worked the margins at Munich, taking part in private and public events, looking to capitalise on Europe's horror at America's potential retreat from the continental theatre.  \n\"No matter how the world changes, China is a responsible major country [that] will keep its major principles and policies consistent and stable ... In a turbulent world China will be a force for stability,\" Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the audience on Saturday. \nWhile the speech was loaded with thinly veiled barbs directed at the United States and implied threats not to cross China's red line, Taiwan, observers thought it was softer in tone than that given by Wang a year earlier, owing to a relative thaw in bilateral ties.  \nPeople in the room said when Wang talked about \"promoting China-US relations along the lines of mutual respect\", his gaze was fixed on American officials in the audience.  \n\"We're at a moment where we see cooperation, competition and rivalry in different doses but all across the agendas,\" former Spanish foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez said on the sidelines.  \n\"You can say on China's behaviour vis-a-vis Russia there was a bit of different tonality from Wang Yi here ... he did not talk about an unlimited partnership with Russia.\" \nBeijing sent three delegations to the Bavarian capital, sources said, one led by Wang, a second group of military officials and a third group of think tankers and academics spearheaded by Fu Ying, a former foreign vice-minister. Wang met at least 10 foreign ministers, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Ukraine's Dmytro Kuleba, and a number of world leaders, with Germany's Olaf Scholz and Serbia's Alexander Vucic among them.  \nBehind closed doors, other Chinese delegates met and spoke alongside European academics and lawmakers who have been sanctioned by Beijing, and in some cases discussed ways in which the sanctions might be lifted. \nThe co-chair of the German Social Democratic Party, Lars Klingbeil, became embroiled in a heated exchange with former diplomat Fu when warning Beijing not to attack Taiwan. \n\"Attacking Taiwan will completely change our relationship with China, and we're absolutely clear on this,\" Klingbeil said. \n\"You said Taiwan and Ukraine are different questions, and I would agree, but I think both are about the question: do we have a multilateral rules-based order?\" he told Fu.  \n\"Is it normal to change borders with military action? That has to be a clear 'no', it's not OK to change borders by military action.\" \nHis remarks earned a stern rebuke from Fu, who said: \"I need to start by correcting Mr Klingbeil, between the mainland and Taiwan is not an international border.\"  \nWang dismissed questions from a moderator on Taiwan and the South China Sea, laughing in his face when he asked if China would accept a \"code of conduct\" for the region.  \nOn another sensitive subject, Fu was asked whether she knew the whereabouts of former foreign minister Qin Gang, who disappeared from public view in June before being stripped of his role.  \n\"Since you are from The Washington Post I guess you know him better than I do,\" Fu told the reporter. \"And since you are a journalist I am sure you've heard the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson's response, you don't need me to repeat it.\" \nChina's close ties with Russia were a subtext to many of the conference's discussions.  \n\"In the conversations that I have had, geopolitics is absolutely front of mind. China is part of that, Russia is part of that ... I find that they are very nuanced in how the different global players are being seen,\" EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said on the sidelines of the event. \nDespite Wang's meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba, in which he vowed not to \"sell lethal weapons\" to either side in the war with Russia, China's relationship with Moscow was invoked as a red flag throughout the weekend.  \nA series of European officials, including the commission president Ursula von der Leyen, warned that China was watching whether the West remained united on Ukraine.  \n\"All the other autocratic adversaries ... are watching very closely whether the democracies stand united,\" she said.\n"

It covered an area 90 nautical miles west of Candon, Ilocos Sur province, and 50 nautical miles northwest of Lubang, Mindoro province, the service wrote on Facebook.\n\"This cooperative activity aims to bolster cooperation between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and their US counterparts,\" the post said. \"With this activity, the [Philippine air force] underscores its commitment and readiness to support the AFP's efforts in safeguarding the national territory and sovereign rights, and upholding regional peace and security.\"\nThe B-52, deployed to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, on a Bomber Task Force mission, did not land in the country, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported Wednesday.\nAir Force officials on Guam referred questions about the patrol to Pacific Air Forces, which did not immediately respond to an email Wednesday.\nThe FA-50 is a compact, versatile supersonic jet manufactured by South Korean firm KAI and developed with Lockheed Martin. South Korea has sold it overseas to Indonesia, Thailand, Poland, Senegal and Malaysia, according to published reports.\nThe exercise followed naval drills between the U.S. and Philippines earlier this month and took place during a period of increased tension between Manila and Beijing in the South China Sea.\nIn recent months, Chinese coast guard and maricreated_at militia have tried unsuccessfully to block Philippine vessels resupplying the BRP Sierra Madre. The grounded World War II-era vessel serves as a territorial outpost at Second Thomas Shoal, a disputed reef in the South China Sea.\nThe B-52 patrol was closely monitored by Chinese naval and air forces, China's state-run Global created_ats newspaper reported Wednesday, quoting the military's Southern Theater Command.\nThe newspaper also quoted Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military aviation expert, as saying the patrol was \"more of a political show\" and \"of little (military) significance.\"\nHowever, a retired Air Force lieutenant general in an email Wednesday to Stars and Stripes, described the joint patrol as significant.\n\"I do not recall it happening before,\" said Dan Leaf, a former deputy commander of U.S. Pacific Command, now the Indo-Pacific Command. \"It is important to remember that the nuclear capabilities of the B-52 are not the key; it has a very impressive sensor suite and has long been used in maricreated_at surveillance training and operations.\"\nAirmen practiced launching sea mines from a B-52 off the coast of Hawaii last year, said Grant Newsham, a retired Marine colonel and senior researcher with the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies in Tokyo.\nThe bombers might also fire anti-ship missiles, he wrote in an email Wednesday.\n\"They can carry a lot more than a fighter aircraft so you have the possibility of launching 'salvos' that makes it harder to defend against,\" he said. \"Suppose you use two or three B52s at once and approaching from different directions. That makes everything harder for the defender.\"\nBombers need protection from a sophisticated enemy such as China, but the Philippine fighters are not the right aircraft to provide it, he said.\n\"This joint patrol is best regarded as a warning that taking on the Philippines means you might also get the full might of the U.S. military,\" Newsham said. \"All in all, a political message to both China and the U.S.' Philippine allies.\"\nrelated stories\nUS, Philippines hold air patrol, drawing China rebuke\nOspreys, grounded after November crash, may fly again soon, report says\nAir Force knows what failed on Osprey crash in Japan but still doesn't know why\n___ (c)2024 the Stars and Stripes Visit the Stars and Stripes at www.stripes.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

    "text": "\nThe People's Liberation Army said it sent forces to the South China Sea to monitor the latest United States-Philippines joint air patrol as the two allies launched their second drill in the disputed waters this month. \nThe air forces of the two countries conducted a patrol over the western Philippines as part of what they have called a \"maricreated_at cooperative activity\". \nIn response, Beijing accused Manila of \"roping in non-regional countries to stir trouble in the South China Sea\" and \"publicly hyping up a so-called joint air patrol\", though it did not directly refer to Washington. \nThe Southern Theatre Command, the PLA division that oversees the South China Sea, said it had sent its naval and air forces to closely watch the situation. The command said it had kept the situation \"under control\" and that it would \"maintain a high level of vigilance\" to defend national ­sovereignty and preserve regional stability. \nThe Philippine Air Force sent three FA-50 combat aircraft while the US Pacific Air Forces sent a B-52H bomber to patrol the area, the Philippine Air Force said on Facebook. \nManila and Washington also carried out an air and sea patrol on February 9. Beijing responded with routine air and naval patrols and said it was maintaining a \"high level of vigilance\". \nChina claims most of the South China Sea based on its \"nine-dash line\" - a line that Beijing says appears on historical maps and that has been used to justify its maricreated_at claims. But Beijing's claims to the resource-rich and strategically important waterway have been disputed by countries in the region, including the Philippines and Vietnam. \nBeijing's tensions with Manila over the South China Sea have been especially heated in recent months. The Philippines has accused China of repeatedly obstructing resupply missions within its exclusive economic zone, while Beijing said the Philippine vessels entered its territory illegally. \nClashes between the coastguards of the two countries near Second Thomas Shoal or Renai Jiao have also prompted Manila to mull plans to install permanent facilities on the reef, which Beijing warned would be met with \"resolute responses\". \nThis week, the Philippines accused Chinese fishermen of using cyanide to catch fish and \"intentionally destroy\" the disputed Scarborough Shoal, also known as Huangyan Island.  \nCyanide fishing has been banned in many countries, including the Philippines, as the toxic chemical can devastate the marine ecosystem. \nIn Beijing, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said the accusation was \"fabricated\" as the Chinese government \"highly values ecological protection and fishery resources and conservation\". \nBilateral relations have changed direction since Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr took office in 2022 and did away with predecessor Rodrigo Duterte's non-confrontational approach in the South China Sea. \nMarcos has forged closer ties with the US and other allies. In November, he resumed joint patrols with the US in the South China Sea - a practice halted by Duterte in 2016. \nHe has also sought closer security cooperation with Japan as Tokyo's ties with Beijing frayed over the East China Sea. \nForeign Minister Wang Yi said recent developments had brought Beijing and Manila to \"a crossroads\".\n"

    "text": "\nChina's top diplomat voiced historical grievances Saturday to justify the country's claims in the South China Sea, some of which have brought it into conflict with its neighbors, including—most prominently—the Philippines.\nForeign Minister Wang Yi's remarks, delivered at a security conference in Munich, Germany, recall the history lesson on Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin gave Tucker Carlson in an interview earlier this month.\nThough their geographical contexts and methods differ, Putin and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, expressed a desire to recover lost territory or international prestige, particularly in the cases of war-torn Ukraine and Taiwan. Beijing also claims \"historical rights\" over large swaths of the South China Sea, including waters lying within its neighbors' exclusive economic zones (EEZ), which are recognized under international maricreated_at law.\n\"The South China Sea islands have been Chinese territory, and when China administered those islands, those surrounding countries had not even been established,\" Wang said Saturday.\nWang accused these surrounding countries\" countries of taking advantage of China's distraction during its Cultural Revolution of the 1960s-70s to these features, largely considered to be low-tide reefs and rocks under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This led to the \"disputes as we see them today,\" he said.\nChina's claims within its \"dashed-line\" overlap with the claims of Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and Taiwan, as well as the Philippines.\nIt's the latter that has been the most persistent in pushing back against China over the past year.

    "text": "\nThe president of the Philippines has said his administration will file a lawsuit if it finds sufficient evidence of cyanide fishing at Scarborough Shoal, a disputed fishing ground in the South China Sea.\n\"The best that we know is that there really is, as far as we can tell,\" the country's official news agency cited President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as saying Tuesday, following the Philippine fisheries industry's statement on Saturday blaming Chinese fishermen.\nDeveloped decades ago as a method of capturing live fish for aquariums, cyanide fishing is now frequently used, including by Philippine fisherfolk, to catch seafood. The cyanide in question has allegedly been used at Scarborough Shoal, which China seized effective control of in 2012. China's coast guard often ejects Philippine fishermen found operating there.\nNazario Briguera, a spokesperson for the Southeast Asian country's Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources said the agency believed the practice was intentional, with the goal of inflicting enough damage to the ecosystem that Philippine nationals would cease fishing operations there.\nBriguera estimated the alleged cyanide use may have already inflicted more than $17.8 million in damage.\n\"This claim is sheer fabrication. China has indisputable sovereignty over Huangyan Island and its adjacent waters,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in response to the accusation during Monday's daily press conference.\nShe said that Beijing greatly values environmental protection and \"resolutely fights against fishing activities that violate laws and regulations.\"\nNewsweek reached out to the Chinese embassy in the Philippines with a written request for comment.\nManila says the livelihoods of an estimated 385,000 Filipinos depend on harvests of seafood in waters around the country's exclusive economic zone—an area extending 200 nautical miles beyond the coastline, within which international maricreated_at law grants it the sole right to natural resources.\nPhilippine Coast Guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela said that the agency does not currently have any evidence linking the cyanide to either China or Vietnam-flagged boats. Fishermen from both countries, like the neighboring Philippines, have traditionally operated in the shoal.\nA spokesperson for the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources told Newsweek Tuesday it was basing its allegation on the testimonies of local fisherfolk. An investigation is now underway, as directed by the country's security council, the spokesperson said.\nIf the investigation spurs a lawsuit, it would not be the first created_at the Philippines has taken a legal approach to drawing international attention to a dispute.\nIn 2013, the country brought its territorial dispute with China, which claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, before an international arbitral tribunal. The five-judge panel ultimately ruled largely in Manila's favor, though China has dismissed the decision as invalid.\nLast September, the Philippine government said it was going forward with a lawsuit over the \"innumerable and immeasurable damage\" that has resulted from Chinese activity in adjacent waters.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nPhilipine Fishermen Load Boats\nPhilippines\nIn this photo taken on August 11, 2022, a Philippine crew prepares to load small boats onto their fishing \"mother\" boat in the village of Cato, Infanta town, Pangasinan province, as they get ready to leave for a fishing expedition to the South China Sea. - The Scarborough Shoal fishing ground, tapped by generations of Filipino fishermen, is one of many potential flashpoints in the country's territorial dispute with China.\n"

A similar agreement is reportedly in the works with Japan.  \nHowever, US access to Batanes is apparently not yet a done deal. That likely explains why Beijing’s foreign ministry warned last week that Taiwan is “at the center of China’s core interests and represents an insurmountable red line and bottom line.”\nDespite those threats and warnings, the Philippines is doubling down on efforts to preserve its sovereignty in the disputed waters while preparing for contingencies in nearby Taiwan, which is separated by the narrow Bashi Channel from northernmost Philippine provinces.\n      Latest stories     \n                  \nAustralia unveils its navy of the future\n          \n                  \nWest needs an exit ramp out of Ukraine\n          \n                  \nAmerica on autopilot to self-inflicted destruction\n          \nAs such, Manila is stepping up its acquisition of increasingly high-end military equipment while expanding sophisticated military exercises with partners including the US, Japan and Australia.\nAside from relying on US military aid, including a recently delivered C-130 transport plane, the Philippines is aiming to procure modern fighter jets, submarines and strategic missile systems under a 2 trillion peso (US$36 billion) military modernization program.\nThat big gun budget has gained the attention of regional arms vendors. Over 20 Indian defense companies visited the Philippines recently to explore expanded military cooperation following New Delhi’s recent delivery of its Brahmos supersonic missiles to the Southeast Asian nation.\nMeanwhile, the Philippines and Sweden are also exploring a major fighter jet deal as Manila aims to modernize its relatively small and aging fleet.\nMost dramatically, France is offering a multibillion-dollar submarine deal to the Philippines amid negotiations over a reciprocal access agreement.\nThe European power is expected to participate for the first created_at this year in the Philippine-US Balikatan exercises, among the region’s largest. Other new partners such as South Korea and Spain are also offering modern weapons systems to the Southeast Asian nation.\nIn the dragon’s shadow\nAlthough the continent-sized China has territorial and maricreated_at disputes with a wide range of nations across its massive borders, tensions with the Philippines have reached a fever pitch in recent months.\nFor China, the Southeast Asian nation has rapidly transformed from a “special friend” in Southeast Asia under the Rodrigo Duterte presidency (2016-2022) into a major enabler of Western power projection under the Ferdinand Marcos Jr administration.\nDespite pronouncing a “new golden era” in bilateral relations, Marcos Jr has steadily adopted an uncompromising stance on the two sides’ South China Sea disputes.\nThat shift came after his largely fruitless state visit to Beijing last year, which produced no tangible agreements on outstanding bilateral concerns including the intensifying maricreated_at spats and the billions of dollars of unfulfilled Chinese infrastructure investment pledges made but not delivered to the Duterte administration.\nFor Duterte’s successor, that meant it was created_at for the Philippines to draw a hard new line and fundamentally reset relations. In that direction, Marcos Jr greenlighted the expansion of defense cooperation with traditional allies as well as more assertive patrols by Philippine maricreated_at forces.\nThese moves, the president appears to believe, allow him to deal diplomatically with China from a comparative position of strength.\nFor China, however, the Philippines is flirting with armed conflict by engaging in what sees as overtly provocative actions.\nThose include Manila’s plans to fortify its de facto maricreated_at military bases reaching from the Second Thomas Shoal to Thitu Island and the increasing frequency and scope of joint maricreated_at drills with Western powers in the South China Sea.\nNow and perhaps most crucially, Beijing is closely monitoring Manila’s emerging new strategic posture on Taiwan. The Marcos Jr administration has so far sent mixed signals on whether it will grant US access to prized Philippine bases near Taiwan’s southern shores. \nBut given Beijing’s rising preparations for possible kinetic action against the self-ruling island, it’s clearly in no mood for Manila’s strategic reorientation toward the West and its regional allies.\nBy all indications, vigorous debates are underway in China on how to dissuade the Philippines from its current course, with some experts like Wu calling for a more decisive and coercive response.\nWary of China’s immense military superiority, the Philippines is leaning into an expanding network of strategic partners who share similar threat perceptions about the Asian superpower.\nSign up for one of our free newsletters\nBig guns wanted\nCoincident with emerging as one of the region’s fastest-growing economies, the Philippines is also becoming a major defense market. The US will deliver three new C-130J-30 Super Hercules airlifters worth $400 million between July 2026 and January 2027.\nOngoing negotiations are also underway for the potential sale of American F16 fighter jets to the Philippine Air Force, though they have reportedly hit a snag over price issues.\nManila is also reportedly considering alternative European options, most notably from Sweden, which is offering more affordable alternatives such as the Saab Jas-39 Gripen multirole fighter.\nThe French, Spanish and South Koreans, meanwhile, are offering multi-billion submarine deals. The Philippine Navy has indicated its preference for up to three submarines, which, according to military experts could be a game changer in shifting the heavily lopsided regional naval balance of power.\n“Three is the magic number…one [submarine] in operation, one in training and one in refit or maintenance,” Ian Storey, a leading maricreated_at security expert, told the media.\nMeanwhile, a large delegation of Indian defense companies including Mahindra Emirates Vehicle Armouring, Bharat Dynamics Ltd, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, DCM Shriram Industries Ltd, and MKU Ltd recently visited Manila for the inaugural India-Philippines defense industry seminar.\n“We have announced our intent to offer a soft loan for defense procurements and this could also cover activities that would eventually extend some sort of joint industrial activity,” Indian Ambassador Shambhu Kumaran said on the sidelines of the defense industry seminar in Manila on February 16.\n“India’s unique selling proposition is that we are able to bring cutting-edge technology at competitive prices,” the diplomat said.\nFollow Richard Javad Heydarian on X at @Richeydarian\nThank you for registering!\nAn account was already registered with this email.

    "text": "\nFeb. 21—MANILA ( Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN) — The United States has sent a nuclear-capable bomber for its first joint patrol with the Philippine military over the West Philippine Sea (WPS), prompting China's military to send its forces there to monitor that activity.\nThree FA-50 light fighters of the Philippine Air Force (PAF) on Monday flew in tandem with a B-52H Stratofortress long-range strategic bomber deployed by the US Pacific Air Forces. The joint flyovers covered 90 nautical miles (166.7 kilometers) west of Candon, Ilocos Sur, and 50 NM (92.6 km) northwest of Lubang, Mindoro, within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, the PAF said in a statement.\nThe B-52s—touted as a long-standing symbol of US military power—have been conducting bomber patrols over the East and South China Seas for decades to demonstrate readiness and commitment to its allies. The B-52s first flew in 1952—which makes it the world's longest-serving combat aircraft—and has since gone through numerous upgrades and design changes.\nThe Boeing Company-designed bomber is capable of flying in high subsonic speeds at an altitude of 50,000 feet and has a range covering around 14,000 km.\n'Stirring up trouble'\nMonday's activity was the second phase of the country's third Maricreated_at Cooperative Activity (MCA) with the United States. The first MCA was held in November last year, followed by a second MCA in January.\nEarly this month, the Philippine Navy's BRP Gregorio del Pilar and the US Navy's USS Gabrielle Giffords held its first phase of the third MCA, with a series of exercises off Mindoro.\nChina's military criticized the mission, saying on Tuesday that the Philippines has \"stirred up trouble\" in the South China Sea by conducting a joint air patrol with \"extraterritorial countries\" and then publicly \"hyping it up.\"\nThe Southern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) said it organized front-line naval and air forces on Sunday \"to closely monitor the situation and keep [it] under control.\"\nIt also said its troops \"remain highly vigilant in resolutely defending national sovereignty, security and maricreated_at rights and firmly safeguarding peace and stability in the South China Sea region.\"\nChina had also earlier accused the United States of provocation after B-52 bombers flew nearby Bajo de Masinloc (Scarborough Shoal) in 2018.\nStationed in Guam\nA senior official of the Philippine military, who was privy to the joint patrol but was not authorized to speak on that matter, told the Inquirer that five aircraft from the PLA Air Force were \"monitored within the Philippine air defense identification zone\" shadowing the patrol, while a Chinese destroyer was also found northeast of Bajo de Masinloc.\nThe Stratofortress was part of a Bomber Task Force in Guam's Andersen Air Force Base intended to support the missions of the US Indo-Pacific Command. The aircraft did not land in the Philippines that Sunday.\nThe PAF said another B-52H had been on its way to join the patrol but had to return to Guam.\n\"This cooperative activity aims to bolster cooperation between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and their US counterparts, thereby enhancing interoperability between its air forces,\" the PAF said.\n___ (c)2024 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

    "text": "\nMember of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the Munich Security Conference. He delivered a keynote speech during the \"Conversation with China\" session, stressing that China will be a force for stability in addressing hotspot issues.\nWang Yi said, China has worked to explore a Chinese way of addressing hotspot issues, one that advocates for non-interference in internal affairs and opposes imposing one's will on others; upholds impartiality and justice and opposes pursuing selfish interests; seeks political settlement and opposes using force; aims to address both the symptoms and the root causes and opposes myopia and one-sidedness. With China's active mediation, a historic reconciliation was reached between Saudi Arabia and Iran, setting off a \"wave of reconciliation\" across the Middle East. This is a living example of implementing the Global Security Initiative put forth by President Xi Jinping.\nThe recent escalation and spillover of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the ongoing tension in the Red Sea once again demonstrate that the question of Palestine is at the heart of the Middle East issue. Generations of the Palestinian people have been displaced, yet they have not achieved the establishment of a legitimate state. This is the longest-lasting injustice in our world. China has stood firm on the side of fairness and justice all along, vigorously working for an end to the conflict and for the protection of civilians. China pushed the UN Security Council to adopt the first resolution since the latest conflict broke out, and issued a position paper on the political settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. China calls for accelerated efforts in establishing an independent State of Palestine and a more broad-based and effective international peace conference to truly realize peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel.\nOn the Ukraine crisis, China has never given up on promoting peace or slackened its efforts to facilitate talks. President Xi Jinping had in-depth exchanges with world leaders including Russian and Ukrainian leaders, playing a constructive role in addressing the crisis. China also published its position paper on the matter, and its special envoy traveled intensively to mediate among different parties. Behind all this, there is only one goal that China hopes to achieve, that is, to build consensus for ending the conflict and pave the way for peace talks.\nChina has made tireless efforts for the political resolution of the Korean Peninsula issue. The most pressing task at the moment is to prevent a vicious cycle, address relevant party's reasonable security concerns, and deescalate and stabilize the situation. On Myanmar, China facilitated various parties of the country in signing a ceasefire agreement in the Chinese city of Kunming, firmly safeguarded peace and stability in northern Myanmar, and encouraged ASEAN to facilitate the proper settlement of the Myanmar issue without interfering in the country's internal affairs. China also actively supported Afghanistan in building an inclusive political framework and adopting moderate policies, to forestall the resurgence and spread of terrorism.\nWith a vast territory and over a dozen neighboring countries, China faces complex disputes left from history. On that, China has stayed committed to managing differences through consultation and resolving disputes through dialogue. China stands ready to work with ASEAN to accelerate consultations on a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, advance maricreated_at cooperation and joint development, and build the South China Sea into a sea of peace, cooperation and friendship.\nSource: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China\n"

The situation could get even more heated in light of the Philippine government's plans to improve facilities on Philippine-occupied features in the West Philippine Sea.\nWhile these plans have been floated around for some created_at, a significant development is that the Philippine legislature has allocated funding to construct a structure on Ayungin Shoal as revealed in a media interview in December by Sen. Sonny Angara, who chairs the Senate finance committee. It did not take long for China to respond to this news. On Dec. 29, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning warned that Beijing would 'respond resolutely' if a permanent structure were built on the shoal, adding that establishing a 'permanent base' there would 'seriously infringe China's sovereignty.'\nThis warning and threat clearly indicate that China considers such action by the Philippines as crossing a red line. Water cannons, military lasers, ramming, dangerous maneuvers that jeopardize safety and lives at sea, swarming tactics, regular harassment of Filipino fishermen-China has done all these, so what else would a 'resolute response' entail? Boarding Philippine Coast Guard ships, cyberattacks, weaponizing trade, sinking a Philippine vessel?\nIt is difficult to predict how China would react if and when we cross that particular red line that it has defined as a matter of the Philippines building a more permanent structure on Ayungin Shoal. The risk is that it could lead to an escalation of an already testy situation, with dire consequences not only for the Philippines but the region as well.\nSo, should we cross that red line? To answer that question, we must look at the issue not from China's point of view but from ours, taking our national interest in consideration.\nIf China has a red line regarding Ayungin Shoal, then we should have one, too, and this should be the reference point from which our policymakers and political leadership base their decision on those planned facilities on Ayungin Shoal. It may not be articulated directly, but if we look closely at our policies, strategy, and actions, one can make a confident guess that our red line is preventing China from establishing a permanent presence on this shoal.\nKeeping the outpost on the BRP Sierra Madre vessel on that shoal is vital to Philippine national security interests and sovereignty. China's determined efforts to disrupt resupply missions to that outpost further reinforce this point. The need to improve the facilities on the shoal is a critical objective. However, to achieve that objective, we would need to cross China's red line.\nHere's another factor to consider in weighing the merits and pitfalls of such an action: If we 'respect' China's red line, it would just be a matter of created_at before BRP Sierra Madre is sunk. It would be foolish of us to assume that China won't move in to establish its own structure on that shoal as it has done in other parts of the South China Sea. When they do, how are we going to stop that? With diplomatic protests, water cannons, military cannons swarming? We don't have the capability and capacity to do much to prevent that scenario from happening, and we just might end up with a Chinese military facility less than 200 miles from the western coast of Palawan.\nI say we do what is needed to protect our sovereignty and national interest. If red lines have to be crossed in relation to Ayungin Shoal, then better that we cross theirs rather than China crossing ours. It will not be an easy decision to make as it is fraught with risk and uncertainty, but it is one that will have to be done sooner rather than later.\nMoira G. Gallaga served three Philippine presidents as presidential protocol officer and was posted as a diplomat at the Philippine Consulate General in Los Angeles, and the Philippine Embassy in Washington.\n"

    "text": "\nIndia, Feb. 21 -- Recent reports of China settling people in the villages called \"Xiaokang\" (well-off villages) along its border with India are disturbing. Since 2019, China has been constructing villages (double-storey, large, and expansive buildings) along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh. This Chinese action is not some ad-hoc activity. \nXiaokangs are being constructed from a strategic perspective as part of the Chinese land borders law (LBL) that came into force on January 1, 2022. China enacted the LBL after the Doklam clashes. It signals China's resolve to settle land border disputes with countries like India on its terms and emphasises civilians cooperating with China's People's Liberation Army in land border defence. This law is part of China's broader and long-term strategy of legal warfare or lawfare, which Charles Dunlap defines as \"a method of warfare where law is used as a means of realising a military objective\". China has a long history of lawfare (or \"falu zhan\"), using domestic and international law to shape the legal context to support State actions. As American scholar Orde Kittrie writes in his book, Lawfare: Law as a Weapon of War, China has a long history of gaming the international legal system for its benefit.\nAn essential component of Chinese lawfare is \"legal preparation of the battlefield\". Jill Goldenziel argues that China uses the law to create facts on the ground that can influence a conflict. For example, in the South China Sea, the Chinese have been aggressive against the Philippines to propel what is known as a nine-dash line narrative, which, according to China, gives it \"historical rights\" in areas that fall under the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). So, in areas that fall under the Philippines's EEZ, China, employing its coast guard law, started massive construction work transforming underwater reefs into above-sea artificial islands with runways and control towers. China's eventual objective was to use these islands for military purposes. Thus, China was clearly creating facts on the ground to strengthen its legal claims over areas that were part of the Philippines EEZ. The Philippines sued China before the Permanent Court of Arbitration, alleging a violation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and got a favourable verdict. China resolutely denounced the decision and ran a massive media campaign to delegitimise the verdict.\nThere are striking parallels between China's aggression in the South China Sea and its actions along the Indo-China LAC. In both instances, it is evident that China views law as an instrument in the service of the State or, more precisely, the Chinese Communist Party. This is diametrically opposed to the rule of law theory in liberal democracies like India, where the function of law is to constrain State power. Constructing massive villages and now settling in people there under the LBL, is aimed at legitimising and institutionalising attempts at territorial revisionism along the Indo-China LAC. These Xiaokangs can also be used for military purposes. China is creating facts on the ground to cement its legal claims over these territories.\nIndia is responding to China's infrastructure built up along the LAC, inter alia, through the Vibrant Villages Programme (VVP) launched in 2023. The VVP aims to develop select villages adjoining the northern border in regions like Arunachal Pradesh, and Ladakh. While this is a welcome development aimed at bolstering border infrastructure along the LAC, more must be done to counter Chinese provocation effectively.\nIndia needs to understand that the Chinese game is not just infrastructure development along the LAC but an attempt to create facts on the ground as part of its lawfare strategy to permanently alter the border landscape to its advantage. Without this insight, Beijing's aggression cannot be successfully countered. India must develop its own lawfare strategy using domestic and international legal instruments. This will require strengthening the Indian State's legal capacity to employ law to serve the nation's strategic objectives.\nPrabhash Ranjan teaches at the faculty of Legal Studies, South Asian University.

In 2024, the exploration workload will remain at a high level. The Company will increase its efforts in natural gas exploration, and push forward the construction of three trillion-cubic-meters-level gas regions, in the South China Sea, the Bohai Sea and onshore China respectively. In 2023, the Company made new exploration discoveries with proved in-place volume of over 100-million-tons BOE in the Bohai Sea and deepwater South China Sea, realizing new discovery of 100-million-tons in-place volume for five consecutive year.In 2024, multiple high-quality projects will be brought on stream. Major projects in China include Suizhong 36-1/Luda 5-2 Oilfield Secondary Adjustment and Development Project, Bozhong 19-2 Oilfield Development Project, Shenhai-1 Phase II Natural Gas Development Project, Huizhou 26-6 Oilfield Development Project and Shenfu Deep-play Coalbed Methane Exploration and Development Demonstration Project. Overseas, projects such as Mero3 Project in Brazil will strongly support production growth. The Company continues to lever technological innovation to sustain reserves and production growth, and to empower the Company's high-quality development. Key technologies for deepwater exploration, and for sustaining and increasing volume from producing oilfields have been continuously improved. Besides, the Company continues to build intelligent oil and gas fields, establish technology system, refine digital scenarios, accelerate the construction of unmanned and semi-unmanned offshore platforms, and speed up the installation of typhoon mode.The Company pursues green development, and explores the industrialization of CCS/CCUS technologies. Comprehensive assessment of storage potential offshore China has been carried out. An offshore CCUS demonstration center in northern China, relying on Bozhong 19-6 gas field, has been planned. The Company endeavors to develop differentiated advantages in deep-sea wind power generation, and vigorously promotes the integrated development of offshore wind power and oil and gas production. Green power substitution will be expedited and green electricity consumption is expected to exceed 700 million kWh in 2024.The Company always attaches importance to rewarding shareholders and actively shares the benefits of development. Subject to the approval by the general meeting of shareholders on the proposed dividends for each year, from 2022 to 2024, the annual payout ratio will be no less than 40% and the absolute dividend is expected to be no less than HK$ 0.70/share (tax inclusive). Mr. Zhou Xinhuai, CEO and President of the Company, said, \"In the coming year, CNOOC Limited will aim high while keeping its feet on the ground. We will implement the three key programs of increasing reserves and production, technological innovation and green development, and press ahead with the initiative of quality and efficiency enhancement, so as to lay a solid foundation for development, and improve the capability of value creation.\"-- End --Notes to Editors:More information about the Company is available at .

    "text": "\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.'s chief market strategist published a new note to clients on Wednesday, highlighting the potential risks of a second inflation wave that could jeopardize the current optimism in the capital markets.\nMany investors currently view the market environment as favorably low-risk, the strategists commented, advocating for investment strategies that align with ongoing market momentum.\nThis period is often characterized by the term \"parabolic stock markets\" and labeled \"platinum-locks,\" signifying an even more favorable scenario than the traditionally optimistic \"goldilocks\" condition.\nHowever, there are peculiar aspects that make current market developments look \"odd,\" they said.\nMore concretely, countries like the UK, Japan, and Germany find themselves in a technical recession, despite their stock markets, along with Europe and Japan's, soaring to unprecedented heights. Further, the market has quickly incorporated high expectations for the impact of various advanced AI technologies on stocks, anticipating a significant short-term economic boost.\nBut recent economic indicators, including a rise in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) alongside some weaker-than-expected economic data from the US and other countries, introduce a level of skepticism towards the most optimistic market outlooks.\n\"With the Nasdaq index rallying ~70% in a year, tight labor markets, and high immigration and government fiscal spending, it wouldn't be a surprise that inflation may stop declining or move higher,\" the strategists say.\nThis, in turn, could challenge the Federal Reserve's efforts to control it, the strategists warned.\nHistorically, loose monetary conditions have been a key factor in driving higher CPI inflation. These inflation dynamics exist apart from geopolitical factors like the current low oil prices (which could potentially surge), Middle East shipping interruptions, and the threat of supply chain disruptions in East Asia due to geopolitical tensions or the aftermath of the US elections.\n\"We believe Investors should be open-minded that there is a scenario in which rates need to stay higher for longer, and the Fed may need to tighten financial conditions,\" the strategists and their team said.\n\"The ~25% stock market rally since October was predicated on a repricing of the Fed (from cutting only 2 created_ats in 2024, to cutting ~7 created_ats in January). While most of those incremental cuts are now priced out, the stock market did not correct at all,\" they added.\nMoreover, market volatility has remained unusually subdued, while risk positioning has grown significantly over the past year.\nWith persistent geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and the South China Sea, there's growing concern over a potential second wave of inflation. These conflicts have already triggered an energy crisis and shipping disruptions in the Red Sea.\nThe most significant threat, however, stems from escalating tensions or a potential trade war with China, which \"could have a much bigger impact on the global economy and would lead to a significant second wave of inflation and market selloff,\" the strategists wrote.\n"

    "text": "\nBoth Taipei and Beijing have said they will enforce the law in the waters between Kinmen island and China's mainland after last week's incident that resulted in the deaths of two Chinese men.\nTaiwan authorities said on Feb. 14, a Chinese speedboat trespassed within 1.1 nautical miles of the eastern coast of the island of Kinmen. The Taiwanese coast guard deployed vessels to expel the boat in accordance with the law.\nThe Chinese crew refused to be inspected and their boat capsized, according to a press release from Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) - the agency in charge of cross-Strait issues. Four people on board fell into the sea, two of them died.\nKinmen is an outlying archipelago less than 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from China's Fujian province but more than 180 kilometers (112 miles) from Taiwan's mainland. The island and Fujian's city of Xiamen are separated by Xiamen Bay.\nChina Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu said on Sunday that China has launched regular law enforcement patrols in the area as part of efforts to protect fishermen's lives and property.\nThe Fujian branch of the coast guard will strengthen maricreated_at law enforcement in the relevant waters, Gan said in a statement.\nBefore that, a spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office Zhu Fenglian condemned the incident which, she said, sparked widespread outrage on the mainland, and severely hurt the feelings of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.\n'Both sides are nervous'\nIn response to Gan Yu's announcement, Taipei's MAC said on Sunday that law enforcement activities by the Taiwanese coast guard will continue.\nAccording to cross-Strait regulations, mainland ships are not allowed to enter Taiwan's restricted and prohibited waters without permission, it said in a statement, In order to safeguard the rights and interests of fishermen, our competent authorities will expel or detain cross-border vessels in accordance with the law.\nThe latest developments show that both sides are nervous, said a Kinmen resident, military historian Timothy Tsai.\nI'm not a fisherman, so I don't worry much at the moment yet, said Tsai, who heads a local military history group.\nBut if the tension between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is escalating further then it will definitely be a concern for everyone.\nIn recent months Kinmen has seen frequent flyovers by Chinese drones, and many believe it could be the first target of a Chinese invasion in the future.\nHowever, Su Tzu-yun, a senior analyst at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taipei, said that in his opinion this incident will not escalate into a military conflict.\nHowever, it is important to note that China's systematic approach, through the proximity of merchant ships close to Taiwan's home island waters and the harassment of fishing boats, indicates that China can still exert pressure on Taiwan, Su told RFA.\nBut Taiwan should not respond alone, the military analyst said, Chinese fishing boats have clashed with Korea in the Yellow Sea, with Japan's Coast Guard in the East China Sea, and with the Philippine Coast Guard in the South China Sea.\nEven in South America, Chinese fishing vessels have clashed with fishermen and sea captains from various countries, he noted.\nThe international community should collectively protest against Beijing's threat to global fishery resources.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "text": "\nAt the heart of the Albanese government's navy overhaul is a fundamental risk assessment: Australia does not face the prospect of a major conflict in the Indo-Pacific by the end of the decade. Or if such a conflict does erupt, it will be fine for the Australian navy to sit on the sidelines.\nThat's because despite title-grabbing promises to double the navy's fleet of warships, the fine print is less attractive. In the short term, the navy's already meagre surface fleet is shrinking.\nA previous plan to extend the life of the current fleet of eight Anzac-class frigates is being scrapped to save money. The oldest of these warships, HMAS Anzac, will never sail again, and will soon be harvested for spare parts. Another frigate, HMAS Arunta, is due to go out of service in 2026. That's two warships down before any new vessels are scheduled to arrive.\nThis is a big gamble given the government has repeatedly said that the nation faces its most dangerous strategic circumstances since World War II. Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed the People's Liberation Army to be capable of capturing the self-governing island of Taiwan by 2027, a move that would probably draw China into a war with Australia's most important ally: the US.\nFewer Anzac-class frigates mean Australia will be less able to participate in freedom of navigation and other training exercises in the region in coming years despite China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea. If things turn ugly in the mid-2040s, though, the government promises that the navy will have a fleet brimming with missile-laden ships equipped to defend the continent and promote stability in the region.\nOne doesn't have to be a cynic to wonder whether such grand plans will become a reality. Major defence projects have long tended to run over budget and behind schedule, and be overtaken by technological advances and changed strategic circumstances. The Hunter-class frigate program, pared back in this iteration, is an example of all three.\nIf the government's overhaul runs exactly to plan, it will not just be an anomaly but a history-defying miracle. The government has also failed to explain the rationale for betting big on surface ships when the war in Ukraine and Houthi aggression in the Red Sea have shown such vessels to be increasingly vulnerable to cheap drone and missile attacks.\nExperts such as Hugh White say we would be better off investing in our own stocks of drones and missiles, preferably dropped on ships from the sky.\nDefence Minister Richard Marles, however, deserves credit for three key aspects of the shake-up. First, he has found more money for defence: $1.7 billion over the budget forward estimates and $11 billion over a decade.\nSecond, he is shattering the expectation that the navy's ships must be built in Australia and tinkered with to make them uniquely Australian. The government says it will buy the first three next-generation frigates \"off the shelf\" from overseas.\nThird, the navy is embracing the possibilities of autonomous systems rather than hulking vessels that can require crews of more than 100 sailors. The big surprise in the announcement was the plan to acquire six US Navy \"drone boats\" that don't require sailors on board.\nThe government has laid out an ambitious plan for the navy, one that looks impressive on paper. Whether it can be implemented in the real world will determine whether the overhaul sinks or swims.\n"

    "created_at": "2024-02-21",
    "text": "\nOnly one US aircraft carrier is currently deployed in the Western Pacific, not five as claimed by several media outlets, according to monitoring by a Beijing-based think tank.\nOver the past week, US news magazines the Newsweek, the National Interest and several other overseas media outlets reported that five US aircraft carriers are set to be deployed in the Western Pacific \"in China's backyard\" or \"on China's doorstep.\"\nSaying the deployment involves almost half of the US' aircraft carrier fleet amid tensions with China, the reports counted the five US carriers as the USS Abraham Lincoln setting out from homeport of San Diego on February 5, the USS Carl Vinson in the vicinity of Hawaii, the USS Theodore Roosevelt making a port call in Guam on February 6, the USS Ronald Reagan docked in Yokosuka, Japan, and the USS George Washington scheduled to replace the USS Ronald Reagan in coming months.\nBut the truth is, now and for a while to come, the only US aircraft carrier that is actively deployed is the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI), a Beijing-based think tank, said in a Sina Weibo post on Tuesday.\nShowing a map on locations of US aircraft carriers currently in the Pacific Ocean, the SCSPI said that the USS Carl Vinson left the Pearl Harbor on Monday and is likely wrapping up its deployment in the Western Pacific on its way back to the US mainland, the USS Ronald Reagan is undergoing maintenance in Yokosuka, and the USS Abraham Lincoln returned to San Diego on Friday.\nThe fleet tracker published by USNI News, the website of the US Naval Institute, showed on Tuesday that the USS George Washington is underway off the east coast of the US mainland, in the Atlantic Ocean.\nOnly the USS Theodore Roosevelt is in active deployment, as it is currently operating in the Philippine Sea after its departure of Guam on February 14, the SCSPI said.\nMeaning the claims of the US deploying five aircraft carriers to the Western Pacific are nothing but unprofessional hype, the SCSPI said.\nBased on the general pattern of aircraft carrier deployment, a carrier spends about one third of its created_at in training, one third in maintenance, and one third in deployment, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global created_ats on Wednesday.\nWith conflicts taking place in other locations around the world, the US will also deploy aircraft carriers elsewhere, so it is very unlikely that the US can deploy as many as five carriers to the Western Pacific without consequences, the expert said, noting that the US' shipbuilding industry is also on a decline, which also caused prolonged maintenance created_at of US carriers.\nZhang Junshe, a Chinese military expert, told the Global created_ats that it is very rare that the US simultaneously deploys five aircraft carriers in a same region, and in this case, the US is not really deploying five of them across the Western Pacific.\nThe US is planning to regularly have three carriers in the Western Pacific, which reflects its strategic focus in the region, Zhang said.\nIt cannot be ruled out that a relatively large number of US carriers gather in the Western Pacific in a short period of created_at in the future, including those on rotations or in transits to other regions, and flex muscles using it as an opportunity, but such attempt to deter its potential competitors through a show of force cannot reach its goal, but can only stir up tensions in the region, experts said.\n"

    "text": "\n The shift in policy on the West Philippine Sea (WPS) from Rodrigo Duterte's appeasement to Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos Jr.'s assertiveness has raised fears, baseless or not, over the row's impact on China's investments in and trade with the Philippines.\nHere's why.\nAccording to a report by the Research and Special Studies Division of the National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP), 'research focusing on the People's Republic of China and its use of economic statecraft, including economic coercion, has started to emerge in recent years.'\n'With its increasing economic clout, being the second largest economy in the world, the world's largest trading state, and the world's largest holder of foreign currency reserves, it is therefore unsurprising that China is using its newfound economic power as leverage in dealing with other states,' it read.\nExpert commends PH efforts to expose China actions in WPS\nAs cited in the article, Jonathan Kirshner, a professor of political science and international studies in the United States, explained that economic coercion, especially on trade, is highly likely. As the NDCP report said, the Philippines has experienced it already after the Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal standoff between the Philippine and Chinese navies in 2012.\nThe report pointed out that China's retaliation was to ban agricultural products, especially bananas, from the Philippines. Chinese citizens were discouraged, too, from visiting the Philippines because of 'security concerns.'\nThis also was the point made by Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, in a column published by ISEAS-Yusof Ishok Institute.\n'After all, the weaponization of trade and investments is not new to Beijing's modern statecraft,' Koh said in the column.\n'As China remains a major trade partner of the Philippines, one could justifiably assume that Beijing might seek to tighten the economic pressure valve on Manila in retaliation,' Koh said.\nIt was explained to INQUIRER.net by Herman Joseph Kraft, a professor of political science at the University of the Philippines Diliman, that 'economic sanctions are serious actions taken by states against another.'\n'Usually it is taken when one party has crossed a line that is a serious threat to the interests of another,' Kraft said.\nHowever, Koh pointed out that so far, 'there are no indications of coercive economic reprisals from China,' especially since the start of the Philippines' strategy of publicizing China's aggression in the South China Sea. This included non-lethal attacks, like aiming military-grade lasers, on Philippine Coast Guard vessels inside the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\n2023: A lookback at rising tension in West PH Sea\nIn 2023, the Chinese Embassy spokesperson said 'China remains the Philippines' largest trading partner, largest source of imports, largest export destination and third largest source of foreign investment under agreements.'\nThis, he said, has effectively promoted post-pandemic recovery.\nTrading partner?\nPhilippine Statistics Authority (PSA) data in 2023 showed that the Philippines was buying more goods than it was selling to China. Last year, China was the biggest source of imported goods with a value of $29.4 billion that peaked in November that year with $2.72 billion worth of Chinese goods being sold to the Philippines, or 25.1 percent of the Philippines' total imports.\nPHOTO: Bar graph of import value and percent share to total imports STORY: WPS economic sanctions to hurt PH, but China even more\nNext to China were Indonesia ($11.694 billion), Japan ($10.165 billion), and the US ($8.35 billion).\nThe problem, however, is that a good balance of trade is 'one in which the value of domestic goods exported exceeds the value of foreign goods imported,' said Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics in the US, in an article published by Econlib.\nPHOTO: Chart of export value and percent share to total exports (2023) STORY: WPS economic sanctions to hurt PH, but China even more\nTaking a look at the balance of trade, the same PSA data showed that in 2023, exports - or Philippine-made goods being sold to China - were worth nearly $11 billion, or just half of what China is selling to the Philippines. March was the peak for exports to China with goods worth $1.4 billion or 21 percent of total Philippine exports that month. The US was the biggest export market with a value of $11.2 billion.\nNext to the US and China were Japan ($10.511 billion) and Hong Kong ($8.390 billion).\nAs explained in the website investopedia.com, when there are too many imports coming into a country in relation to its exports-which are products shipped from that country to a foreign destination-it can distort a nation's balance of trade and devalue its currency.\nLess investments\nMarcos said last year that when he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference summit, 'essentially [...] we were in agreement that the problems [...] in the South China Sea should not be the defining element of our relationship.'\nOne way economic interest in the Philippines is being measured is through foreign direct investments or FDIs.\nRELATED STORY: PH not provoking conflict in West Philippine Sea - AFP\nThe Philippines' Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas explained that foreign direct investments 'are an important source of external financing for developing countries,' stressing that 'given its long-term nature, it provides a stable source of funding for host or receiving economies.'\nPHOTO: Chart showing approved China investments from 2016 to 2023 STORY: WPS economic sanctions to hurt PH, but China even more\nAccording to data from the PSA, approved investments from China from 2016 to the second quarter of 2023 was valued at $163.802 billion, behind Japan, which had $282.355 billion, and Singapore, which had $237.988 billion. The US only had $111.775 billion in approved investments.\nThe data indicated that in both the last quarters of 2018 and 2019, approved investments from China reached P47.985 billion and P86.311 billion. It hit its lowest in the second quarter of 2020 at only P69.70 million.\nPHOTO: Chart of approved foreign investments coming from China, Japan, Singapore, and the USA in 2016 compared to 2022 STORY: WPS economic sanctions to hurt PH, but China even more\nThe value of approved agreements in the first year of Marcos was almost the same as in Duterte's.\nAs stressed in a 2017 article by foreign affairs research specialist Edcel John Ibarra and published by the Center for International Relations and Strategic Studies, Japan, the US, and Singapore, which are also significant trading partners, 'are keen to counterbalance an aggressively rising China.'\nImbalance\nFor Joshua Espeña, vice president of the think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, 'doing nothing or something would hurt the Philippines' economy; our economy is already hurt because of the imbalanced trade.'\n'It would imply either looking for other import sources with the same production rate or as close to China or forcing its domestic private sectors to produce more,' he told INQUIRER.net, stressing, however, that 'the costs will be at the household level in the medium term.'\n'But the long-term implication is to help the Filipino economy eventually niche in the global market,' said Espeña.\n'So far, doing nothing is already hurting our development plans. If the Philippines wishes to leverage its newfound middle power position, geoeconomics is integral to any rising state actor in the international system,' he said.\n'Laban ng lahat': Civilian role in kicking China out of PH waters growing, crucial\nEspeña, also a lecturer at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, pointed out that should China decide to sanction the Philippines, 'it will hurt us, but it will also hurt China in terms of global supply chain.'\nFostering economic blocs, he said, is a way forward to consider mini-lateral approaches with certain ASEAN members and like-minded partners, and pushing for the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\n'We hedge the sources, but we must craft a pro-Filipino grand strategy to lift the Filipino people to greater heights,' he said.\nHit China where it hurts\nNo economic coercion, yet\nBut despite the more assertive actions taken by the Philippines in securing its rights in the WPS, Kraft said that 'it doesn't seem like it has reached a point where China will resort to economic sanctions.'\n'There might be some targeted actions against particular industries that would be tantamount to harassment, but full-blown economic sanctions are not yet likely in the short term and under current circumstances,' he explained.\nThis was shared by Espeña, who pointed out that 'as far as we are concerned, it is likely that China would think twice about hitting us with economic sanctions hard given the state of their domestic economy whose development model is now geared toward exporting goods and services.'\n'Beijing's model has created a monster of making more and imposing it on them. So I think their post-COVID economic policy is to offset the loss of the export hurt exacerbated by its trade war with Washington,' he said.\n'We have to take into account that China's disinformation campaign and diplomatic threats are another window of seeing how vulnerable they are without securing the regional supply chain,' Espeña said.\n'For instance, China gets most of its nickel sources from the Philippines, so it goes on to suggest we may have more leverage in fostering a geoeconomic agenda of hurting their supply chain,' he added.\n"

    "text": "\nFor two years now, Russia has waged a full-scale invasion against the territorial integrity and political independence of Ukraine. Almost two years after the anniversary of this invasion, of this act of aggression, which, in the words of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, constitutes the supreme crime of international law, another crime has been perpetrated, the assassination of Alexei Navalny, Russian opposition leader, lawyer, anti-corruption activist and political prisoner.\nThis assassination also took place one month before the Russian \"elections\". This cowardly act confirms, once again, that we are facing a criminal and recidivist government, whose actions represent a serious challenge to the international order.\nWhen I speak of criminal and recidivist actions, I am referring to the aggressions that the Russian Federation has perpetrated against Moldova (Transnistria), Georgia (Abkhazia and South Ossetia) and Ukraine (Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk), prior to the invasion and subsequent illegal annexation of each Ukrainian region. The Putin regime has also been a repeat offender in the assassination of political dissidents; the case of Navalny joins those of Alexander Litvinenko, Sergei Skripal, journalist Anna Politkovskaya and oligarch Boris Berezovsky.\nOther mysterious deaths could be added to the list, such as that of the mercenary Yevgeny Prigozhin. In short, Putin's regime has reminded us, prior to the second anniversary of the invasion, that no matter whether you are a journalist, mercenary, siloviki, oligarch, spy or anti-corruption activist, if you are considered a threat to the regime, the regime will try to assassinate you.\nThis accumulation of repeated criminal actions pursues the ultimate goal of establishing a new international order that is friendly to autocracies, kleptocracies and gross human rights violations. A multipolar international order in which the maxim of the Melian dialogue applies, the one that says \"the strong impose their power, while the weak suffer what they must suffer\". It is necessary to recognize that the current order, the one we are seeking to replace, has many imperfections.\nOne of them is that it was conceived with a defect of origin, a somewhat illusory assumption that the States, in the exercise of their sovereignty, would behave in accordance with international law because that was in their best interests. The error lay in assuming that all States and their rulers would act in accordance with standards of decency in order to facilitate relations of peace, friendship and cooperation, and not on the basis of expansionist and imperial interests. In other words, they would refrain from criminal behavior.\nThe Russian invasion has put the international order to the test and its response has been emphatic. Despite all the flaws inherent in the order itself, such as the veto in the UN Security Council of the five permanent members, institutions such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC) have been activated, exercising jurisdiction over flagrant violations of international law and the commission of atrocities.\nThese institutions, notably, have confronted attempts to pose false binaries around the global North-South divide. Good evidence of this is the ongoing ICJ litigation between Israel and South Africa, and the ICC investigations in Palestine.\nFor the past two years, Russia has been hiding behind alleged double standards to legitimize its criminal actions. Basically, they claim that Russia attacks other states and murders opponents in the same way that Western powers have done.\nThe flaw in this line of argument, which is elusive to many, is that the aggressions and murders perpetrated by the West in different latitudes in no way legitimize Russian atrocities. Imperialism, expansionism, aggressions and violations of international law must be condemned regardless of who they emanate from, no matter how ideologically sympathetic they may be to us.\nTwo years after the aggression of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the global scenario is quite turbulent. In Africa, coups d'état and the presence of mercenaries are part of everyday life; in Latin America, disenchantment with democracy is growing; in the Middle East, the war in Gaza threatens to spill over to other latitudes, including Lebanon and Yemen; and in Asia, tensions in the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea and the Korean peninsula continue.\nAccording to some, the establishment of a new international order is imminent, based on multipolarity, equidistance and the sovereign authority of states to do as they please within their borders. We must therefore ask ourselves what will happen to the liberal internationalism that gave rise to the United Nations, which resulted in the prohibition of wars of aggression, the peaceful settlement of international disputes, decolonization, recognition of the territorial integrity of States and their political independence, the emergence of human rights and regulations on transparency. That same international order that allowed us Panamanians to recover our sovereignty is the one that some States seek to replace, will we defend it?\nThe author is a lawyer and professor of international law.\n"

    "title": "China gamble could hit navy review; Analysis | Marles Under Pressure",
    "created_at": "2024-02-21",
    "text": "\nAt the heart of the Albanese government's navy overhaul is a fundamental risk assessment: Australia does not face the prospect of a major conflict in the Indo-Pacific by the end of the decade. Or if such a conflict does erupt, it will be fine for the Australian navy to sit it out.\nThat's because despite title-grabbing promises to double the navy's fleet of warships, the fine print of the announcement is less attractive. In the short term, the navy's already meagre surface fleet is shrinking.\nA previous plan to extend the life of the current fleet of eight Anzac-class frigates is being scrapped to save money. The oldest of these warships, HMAS Anzac, will soon be harvested for spare parts. Another frigate, HMAS Arunta, is due to go out of service in 2026. That's two warships down before any new vessels are scheduled to arrive.\nThis is a big gamble, given the government has repeatedly said the nation faces its most dangerous strategic circumstances since World War II. Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed the People's Liberation Army to be capable of capturing Taiwan by 2027, a move that would probably draw China into a war with the United States.\nFewer Anzac-class frigates mean Australia will be less able to participate in freedom-of-navigation and other training exercises in the region despite China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea.\nIf things turn ugly in the mid-2040s, though, the government promises that the navy will have a fleet brimming with missile-laden ships equipped to defend the continent and promote stability in the region.\nBy that created_at, according to the government, the navy will have added three new types of warships to its arsenal: six Hunter-class frigates, up to 11 next-generation frigates and six \"optionally crewed\" vessels.\nOne doesn't have to be a cynic to wonder whether such grand dreams will become a reality. Major defence projects have had a long tendency to run over budget, behind schedule and be overtaken by technological developments and changed strategic circumstances.\nThe troubled Hunter-class frigate program, pared back in this iteration, is a perfect example of all three challenges.\nIf the government's overhaul runs perfectly to plan, it will not just be an anomaly but a history-defying miracle. Especially given the navy is already busy with the massive undertaking of converting to nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS pact.\nThe government has also failed to explain the strategic rationale for betting big on surface ships when the war in Ukraine and Houthi aggression in the Red Sea have shown such vessels to be increasingly vulnerable to cheap drone and missile attacks.\nExperts such as Hugh White say we would be better off investing in our own stocks of drones and missiles, preferably dropped on ships from the sky.\nDefence Minister Richard Marles, however, deserves credit for three key aspects of the proposed shake-up.\nFirstly, he has found more money for defence: $1.7 billion over the budget forward estimates and $11 billion over a decade. Marles has been under fire from military experts and the defence industry for failing to match his rhetoric with cash, and there has been persistent speculation that he has been \"rolled\" in Cabinet's expenditure review committee by Foreign Minister Penny Wong and other colleagues. Defence spending is set to rise to 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product by the early 2030s, a significant rise from Labor's election pledge of 2.1 per cent.\nSecondly, Marles is shattering the expectation that the navy's ships must be built in Australia and tinkered with to make them uniquely Australian. While committing to continuous shipbuilding in Perth and Adelaide, the government says it will buy the first three next-generation frigates \"off the shelf\" from overseas. Crucially, a mature ship design will also be selected. This will cut down on risk and allow the ships to enter the water sooner.\nThird, the navy is finally embracing the possibilities of autonomous systems rather than hulking vessels that can require crews of more than 100 sailors. The big surprise in Tuesday's announcement was the government's plan to acquire six US Navy \"drone boats\" that do not require sailors on board to operate. Such boats are still in a developmental phase, but it is good the government is thinking about the technology of the future rather than the past.\nThe government has laid out an ambitious plan for the navy, one that looks impressive on paper. Whether it can be implemented in the real world, with all its complexities, will determine whether the overhaul sinks or swims.\n"

Easy to confuse as both institutions seem to have larger than life performers, especially at Holyrood.\nAs the Oscars awards ceremony will soon be upon us, perhaps our culture Minister, Angus Robertson, could avoid missing out a second created_at and submit the following recent Scottish Government “film” productions. The Academy judges might think that the “films” are too far fetched and beyond the limits of reality. Little do they know (but Scotland does, unfortunately).\nDisaster movie: The SNP and Greens coalition in It’s A Blunderful Life.\nBiblical parable story: Michael Mathieson in The Greatest Stories Ever Told.\nNicola Sturgeon in The Crying Game.\nHumza Yousaf in the remake of a James Dean Film: Rebel Without a Clue.\nCan you imagine the acceptance speeches if they win?\nFraser MacGregor, Edinburgh\nTyre trouble\nI’m wondering how the Edinburgh pavement parking ban is going? With fines of up to £100, one wonders how this law is going to be enforced.\nThe SNP virtually removed police from our streets and traffic wardens are thin on the ground. So, will we see the forming of vigilante groups of disaffected pensioners with created_at on their hands forming to patrol the streets, naming and shaming on facebook and painting “I parked on the pavement” in large letters on the sides of offending vehicles, most of which will have plenty room for large letters because they’ll be our old friends and usual suspects, SUVs, Range Rovers etc, ruining the environment, destroying our roads and hogging the pavements outside nurseries.\nThe first task is to identify the difference between bad parking and illegal parking. Is bad parking having your wheel on the kerb, maybe a tyre’s width, or would that count as on the pavement and therefore illegal? At what point would bad parking become bad enough to become illegal? Will there be a “buffer zone” of a designated width that you’re allowed some rubber in?\nIt’s all mostly academic though, because if road and traffic damage gets any worse, we soon won’t be able to tell where the roadside ends and the pavement begins.\nIan McElroy, Thurso, Highland\nNaval power?\nThere are still elements in the Conservative Party who regard the Royal Navy as a global power and, when aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, with destroyers and frigates, entered the South China sea, in the summer of 2021, this was depicted as such.\nOften when the MoD talks of our naval presence it actually means a River Class Offshore Patrol vessel (an OPV). Its main armament is a 30mm cannon at the bow and machine guns. They have a crew of 30. For seven years that is how we have defended the Falkland Islands with little HMS Forth, along with 4 RAF typhoons.\nThe new Argentinian President, Javier Milei, is tripling his country’s defence budget and shopping for F16 jets, modern warships and subs. The Falklands used to be defended by a major warship with anti-ship and air defence missiles but today frigates are being scrapped as we cannot staff them.\nWhile it is commendable that the Foreign Secretary, Lord David Cameron, is visiting the Falkands; kind words regarding them “staying part of the British Family” are unlikely to be enough. President Milei will watch with interest what transpires with Guyana, where the formidable might of the Venezuelan armed forces are currently being held at bay, similarly, by little sister ship HMS Trent.\nJohn V Lloyd, Inverkeithing, Fife\nPolls apart\nAlex Orr (Letters, 20 February), accuses David Cameron of hypocrisy for stating the Falkland Islands would remain British as long as the islanders wish to. This was based on the fact that in a referendum, 99.8 per cent of islanders voted to remain British. In a Scottish referendum, 55 per cent of those voting chose to remain part of the UK, with 45 per cebt voting to leave the UK. In effect, 22 per cent more voters chose to remain in the UK than leave.\nThese are the facts. It is Mr Orr’s opinion is that the majority of Scots want independence, and appears to be a fact only in the dream world nationalist keyboard warriors live in.\nIf anyone is to be accused of hypocrisy it is those wishing to leave the UK where Scots have a big say in Parliament, a common language, a single island, and where 60 per cent of Scotland’s exports go, and join Europe where Scotland would be an insignificant voice in a 700-plus member European Parliament.\nBrian Barbour, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland\nDefence of realm\nThe Royal Navy did not “turn to Scotland for help”, as D Jamieson writes (Letters, 20 February). Rosyth is one of the UK MoD shipyards and the one where the Queen Elizabeth was actually built  – so where else would she go for repair?\nI would remind Mr Jamieson that Scotland is part of the afore-mentioned MoD and has far more than its population share of jobs within that organisation so “theft of Sottish resources” is quite risible.\nA McCormick, Terregles, Dumfries and Galloway\nDelays and decay\nThe full extent of the Scottish Government’s neglect of the NHS in Scotland is now being laid bare. People suffering from dental problems are being forced abroad to receive treatment or are resorting to DIY techniques to get pain relief (Scotsman, 20 February), all because insufficient NHS dentists are available. This can only lead to long-term dental problems within the population, a situation which has been highlighted by dentists for years with successive Health Secretaries doing very little to remedy the situation.\nThe same delay and decay theme can be seen with the postponement of the building of new hospitals, surgeries and other premises, sorely needed but now put on the back burner by the government. It will take years for the NHS to recover from the under-investment and the incompetent use of resources, if ever, and it will be the patients, not the politicians, who will  suffer.\nBob MacDougall, Kippen, Stirling\nSplit personality\nHumza Yousaf is kicking up a storm because of a Labour plan to increase the North Sea windfall tax (Scotsman, 20 February).\nThe SNP oppose the granting of licences for new oil and gas exploration. Their plans for energy supply include the cessation of oil and gas extraction from the North Sea. They are in partnership with the Green Party, who would turn off the oil and gas taps themselves given the chance.The SNP/Green stance over oil and gas threatens thousands of jobs and whole communities yet Mr Yousaf is accusing Labour of the same charge. He preached to Americans in New York about the use of fossil fuels – not that preaching to other nations is in his remit – but it just makes me wonder how many Humza Yousafs there are.\nIan Balloch, Grangemouth, Falkirk\nThe new Hitler\nWith the death of Alexei Navalny it is surely obvious to all that Vladimir Putin is the 21st century equivalent of Adolf Hitler. Similar to Hitler, he has built for himself an impregnable authoritarian position, and similar to Hitler, has surrounded himself with yes-Men and cronies whom he has rewarded through making them multi-millionaires by way of corruption and the gifting of state assets.\nHe has also deliberately associated with equally authoritarian states, such as North Korea, Belarus, China, and Iran. We have recently heard the threats issued by Dmitry Medvedev, Putin’s equivalent to Hitler’s Goebbels, should the western democracies interfere further with the Russian illegal invasion of Ukraine.\nFollowing the deaths of so many opponents of Putin over the past 20 years, including the poisonings in the UK of Litvinenko and the more recent poisoning attempts on the Skripals by the Kremlin’s FSB operatives in Salisbury,  it is imperative that that UK, US and EU democracies step up their assistance to Ukraine, even to the point of providing their armed forces to drive the Russian army out of Ukrainian land.\nTurning a blind eye to what is going on will lead to further future atrocities, and we are already hearing of the fears being expressed by Finland, Sweden and Moldova\nThe beginning of the end of Hitler came about when the UK finally countered the Nazi invasion of Poland. That must now be replicated by all of the democracies in the world, but particularly, by the US, UK and the countries of the European continent\nDerek Farmer, Anstruther, Fife\nHealthy debate\nCarolyn Taylor (Letters, 19 February) lists a dozen or more qualities a good nurse must have.\nI agree with her, but my earlier point remains that none of those qualities require a degree and by insisting upon one we are putting off and losing the services of many otherwise very suitable trainees, however desirable and suitable a nursing degree may be for the academically minded.\nTim Flinn, Garvald, East Lothian\nWrite to The Scotsman\nWe welcome your thoughts – NO letters submitted elsewhere, please.

    "text": "\nThe Philippines has said it is continuing its patrol of a bitterly contested area in the South China Sea, defying China as it seeks to reassure local fishermen.\nManila refuted the Chinese Coast Guard's claim it had expelled a Philippine fisheries bureau vessel from the Second Thomas Shoal, which China effectively occupied after a 2012 standoff with its neighbor.\nThe shoal, known in the Philippines as Bajo De Masinloc and in China as Huangyan Dao, is less than 140 miles from the Philippine province of Luzon and nearly 600 miles from Hainan, the nearest Chinese province. It sits well within the Southeast Asian country's internationally recognized exclusive economic zone.\nThe Chinese Coast Guard said Thursday it had driven away a Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) that was \"illegally trespassing in waters adjacent to Huangyan Dao.\"\nThe U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty ally's coast guard was quick to respond to the claim.\n\"This statement is inaccurate,\" the agency's spokesperson Jay Tarriela wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\nHe said the BRP Datu Sanday continues its patrol in contested waters on its mission of \"actively ensuring the security of Filipino fishermen in that area.\" He said this would be soon confirmed by the journalists who are currently embedded on the ship.\nThe neighbors' latest tit-for-tat comes after the BFAR accused Chinese crews of damaging the shoal through cyanide fishing, citing testimonies by Philippine fishermen. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has threatened legal action if this is borne out by an investigation.\nThe BFAR and Chinese foreign ministry didn't immediately respond to Newsweek's written requests for comment.\nThe Fisheries Bureau and Coast Guard patrols are consistent with President Marcos Jr.'s orders to maintain a Philippine presence in the disputed waters continually.\nThe country is seething after videos emerged last month of China once again chasing off its fishermen from the shoal, a traditional fishing ground for them as well as anglers from China and Vietnam.\nChina asserts claims over most of the South China Sea, including parts that lie within the EEZs of the Philippines and other neighbors. An EEZ is a 200-nautical-mile zone within which maricreated_at law grants claimant states sole access to natural resources.\nThe Philippines brought the dispute before an international arbitral court shortly after losing control over the Second Thomas Shoal. Beijing chose not to take part in the proceedings and maintains that the court's 2016 decision, which largely favored the Philippines, is illegal.\nLast week, the Philippine Senate approved an amendment that would officially claim any man-made features falling within the nation's EEZ, including Spratly Island reefs that China has built up and militarized.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nBFAR Ship Delivers Supplies To Fishermen\nTed Aljibe/AFP via Getty Images\nThis February 15, 2024, photo shows Filipino fishermen in wooden boats queueing for free fuel beside the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources ship the BRP Datu Tamblot, left, as a Chinese coast guard ship monitors near the China-controlled Scarborough Shoal, in the South China Sea.

    "text": "\nFacing recent rights-infringing moves from the Philippines in the South China Sea, the Taiwan authorities near Kinmen in the Taiwan Straits and Japan around the Diaoyu Islands, the China Coast Guard (CCG) carried out intensive law enforcement activities, displaying its capabilities gained from high-quality development and in firmly safeguarding China's territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at interests and upholding order, experts said on Thursday.\nOn Thursday, the CCG repelled, in accordance with the law, the Ship 3002 of the Philippines' Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources when the vessel illegally intruded into waters adjacent to China's Huangyan Dao (also known as Huangyan Island) in the South China Sea, the CCG said in a notice on the day.\nIn February alone, the CCG released at least five notices or statements on its measures against illegal Philippine moves around Chinese islands and reefs in the South China Sea, namely Huangyan Dao and Ren'ai Jiao (also known as Ren'ai Reef), with analysts saying the CCG effectively dealt with the Philippines' attempt to take advantage of China's Spring Festival holidays and firmly defended national sovereign security and maricreated_at rights.\nSince August 2023, the Philippines has ramped up provocations on Chinese islands and reefs in the South China Sea by repeatedly attempting to send illegal building materials to its warship illegally grounded on China's Ren'ai Jiao and trespassing into waters adjacent to China's Huangyan Dao.\nMost of the Philippine provocations were made by coast guard ships, government ships and fishing ships, so the Chinese side reciprocally sent CCG ships and took legitimate, professional and restrained measures, experts said.\nDing Duo, a deputy director of the Institute of Maricreated_at Law and Policy at the China Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the Global created_ats on Thursday that the CCG's law enforcement activities in the South China Sea aim to safeguard China's territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights.\nThe CCG plays a special role in safeguarding territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights, as it can not only send warnings and effectively defend territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights, but at the same created_at its measures are less likely to lead to conflicts, experts said.\nSending the CCG also shows that the essence of the South China Sea issue for China is about territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at delimitation, and China's measures are not about geopolitics or military confrontation, Ding said, noting that it is the Philippines and the US that are generalizing the issue and promoting militarization, with an example being the Philippine-US joint military patrols.\nThe more frequent and intensive the Philippines provokes, the more frequent and intensive the CCG's control measures will be, and this reflects China's jurisdiction over the islands and reefs in the South China Sea, analysts said.\nIn the Taiwan Straits, after a Chinese mainland fishing boat was treated brutally by Taiwan authorities in waters near Taiwan authorities-administered Kinmen Island on February 14, which led to all four people on board falling into the sea and two of them dead, the CCG announced on Sunday that the coast guard of East China's Fujian Province will strengthen its maricreated_at law enforcement and carry out regular law enforcement and patrols in the waters between Fujian's Xiamen and Kinmen to ensure the safety of fishermen's lives and property.\nTaking place at a created_at when the cross-Straits relations are particularly sensitive especially after separatist Lai Ching-te just won Taiwan's regional leader election, the recent incident off Kinmen was a serious one because it caused casualties, but similar situations in which Taiwan authorities brutally treated mainland fishing ships have often occurred, experts said, noting that previously, the Chinese mainland showed much goodwill, provided many benefits to Taiwan compatriots and did not take forceful measures as much in related incidents, but that does not mean the mainland is not capable of doing so.\nSome analysts on the island said the CCG could conduct its patrols in the Taiwan Straits as those around the Diaoyu Islands in asserting law enforcement rights. \nThe CCG regularly holds patrols around the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, with the latest announcement made on February 6, saying that the CCG Flotilla 2502 conducted patrols in Chinese territorial waters off the Diaoyu Islands on the day in a move to safeguard rights.\nOn January 27, several Japanese vessels illegally entered Chinese territorial waters off the Diaoyu Islands, and CCG vessels took necessary control measures and repelled them in accordance with the law, a CCG spokesperson said at the created_at.\nBefore the latest incidents in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Straits, media mostly focused on the CCG because of its activities around the Diaoyu Islands, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global created_ats on Thursday.\nThe CCG started routine patrols to defend territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights after Japan's attempt to \"nationalize\" the Diaoyu Islands in 2012, observers noted. The Japanese side frequently sensationalizes the CCG's legitimate activities, while the Chinese side also announced its patrols on a routine basis.\nThe CCG's regular patrols and constant presence in effect asserted China's sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands, the expert said.\nWhile the South China Sea issue and the Diaoyu Islands issue are fundamentally different from the Taiwan question, with the former two involving territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at delimitation with other countries and the latter one being China's internal affair, the islands and reefs in the South China Sea, the Diaoyu Islands and Kinmen, as well as all islands administered by Taiwan authorities, are all Chinese territories, experts pointed out.\nIn recent years, the CCG enhanced its equipment in both quality and quantity, including commissioning more vessels and boosting logistics support, trained more personnel, and had them deployed in missions throughout the year, realizing effective control in hot regions, another Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global created_ats on Thursday.\nAccording to publicly available information, the CCG has commissioned 10,000 ton-class cutters, and has received transfers of Type 056 corvettes from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, which are deemed powerful additions to the CCG fleet.\nWith the CCG's continued development, the CCG's law enforcement in related waters will become even more intensive to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and uphold order, the expert said.\n"

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \n\"If we feel that there is enough ground to do so, we will [pursue charges],\" Marcos said, adding that cyanide use in Philippine waters was not uncommon. \n\"I do know that there are cases of cyanide fishing, even before, here in the Philippines. But I think the reason that it has been more alarming is that it has become more prevalent,\" he said. \nJonathan Malaya, a spokesman of the National Security Council, said BFAR would work on gathering more evidence to back its claim, which China dismissed as \"sheer fabrication\". \n\"The Chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of ecological environment and conservation of fishing resources and resolutely fights against fishing activities that violate laws and regulations,\" its foreign ministry said. \nBFAR spokesperson Nazario Briguera accused the Chinese fishermen of using cyanide to \"intentionally destroy Bajo de Masinloc to prevent Filipino fishing boats from fishing in the area\". \nMalaya said BFAR's findings, if substantiated, could be sent to the Department of Justice and the Office of the Solicitor General for building a case on environmental destruction before an appropriate international tribunal. \n\"The challenge here is to prove the responsibility for the coral degradation and the impact to the environment is coming from these specific people,\" he said. \nSolicitor General Menardo Guevarra agreed with Malaya, saying \"any legal action must be supported by strong, solid and competent evidence that can withstand the scrutiny of any international tribunal\". \nCyanide fishing involves the sprinkling of the deadly chemical compound near coral reefs to stun fish so they can be easily caught. \nFisherfolk group Pamalakaya criticised BFAR for \"failing\" to rein in the controversial fishing practice, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported. \n\"Despite the evident poaching and other destructive fishing activities of foreign fishing vessels in the country's territorial waters, the BFAR continues to fail to implement its own fishing laws to protect the marine resources and Filipino fisherfolk,\" it said. \nScarborough Shoal has long been a key source of tension between the Philippines and China. \nChina's coastguard drove away a BFAR vessel that it said \"illegally intruded\" into the waters adjacent to the shoal, state media reported on Thursday. \nBut a Philippine coastguard spokesman dismissed that claim. \n\"This statement is inaccurate. The BFAR vessel, BRP Datu Sanday, continues to patrol the waters of Bajo De Masinloc. Currently, the BFAR vessel is actively ensuring the security of Filipino fishermen in that area,\" Commodore Jay Tarriela said on Thursday. \nLast year, the Philippine coastguard removed a 300-metre-long barrier installed by China at the entrance to the strategic outcrop, which Manila says lies within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), a 370km stretch of water where coastal states have exclusive rights to fish and other resources. \nBeijing claims sovereignty over almost the entirety of the South China Sea - where the Philippines and several other nations have competing claims - and has rejected a 2016 international ruling that ruled in favour of Manila and found China's assertions have no legal basis. \nCopyright (c) 2024.

    "text": "\n2024 FEB 22 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Ecology Daily News -- Current study results on ecology have been published. According to news originating from Beihai, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"As emerging pollutants, organophosphate esters (OPEs) have been reported in coastal environments worldwide.\" \n Financial supporters for this research include Guangxi Natural Science Foundation; Guangxi Science And Technology Base And Talent Special Projects; Guangxi Key Research And Development Program. \n The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Ministry of Natural Resources: \"Nevertheless, information on the occurrence and ecological risks of OPEs, especially the related transformation products, in mangrove wetlands is scarce. For the first created_at, the coexistence and distribution of OP triesters and their transformation products in three mangrove wetlands in the Beibu Gulf were investigated using ultrasonication and solid-phase extraction, followed by UHPLC-MS/MS detection. The studied OPEs widely existed in all the sampling sites, with the total concentrations ranging from 6.43 ng/g dry weight (dw) to 39.96 ng/g dw and from 3.33 ng/g dw to 22.50 ng/g dw for the OP triesters and transformation products, respectively. Mangrove wetlands tend to retain more OPEs than the surrounding coastal environment. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the TOC was not the sole factor in determining the OPEs' distribution, and degradation was not the main source of the transformation products in mangrove sediments in the Beibu Gulf. The ecological risks of selected OPEs for different organisms were also assessed, revealing a medium to high risk posed by OP diesters to organisms.\" \n According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The levels or coexistence of OPEs and their metabolites in mangroves need constant monitoring, and more toxicity data should be further studied to assess the effect on normal aquatic organisms.\" \n For more information on this research see: Organophosphate Triesters and Their Transformation Products in Sediments of Mangrove Wetlands in the Beibu Gulf, South China Sea.

It did not give further details of the incident. \nThe BFAR vessel is the BRP Datu Sanday, a ship that has previously been used for resupply missions to disputed islands and atolls in the South China Sea, including Scarborough Shoal. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nThe Philippine coastguard on Thursday disputed the Chinese claim, saying the statement was \"inaccurate\" and that the Datu Sanday was still patrolling in waters near the shoal. \n\"Currently, the BFAR vessel is actively ensuring the security of Filipino fishermen in that area,\" Commodore Jay Tarriela, a coastguard spokesman, said on X. \"Some of our media friends are embedded on board the BFAR vessel, and their forthcoming reports upon completion of the mission will confirm the accuracy of our statement.\" \nManila announced last week that Philippine coastguard and BFAR vessels would be sent to the shoal from this month \"to protect the rights and safety of Filipino fishermen\" in the waters. \nThat came after China's coastguard last month said it had chased away four Filipinos who had \"illegally\" entered the waters. \nBoth China and the Philippines lay claim to Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing ground in the middle of the South China Sea. The shoal is located around 220km (120 nautical miles) west of the Philippine island of Luzon and about 1,000km (590 nautical miles) east of China's Hainan Island. \nChina took control of the shoal in 2012 after a tense stand-off, prompting Manila to launch an international arbitration case over their maricreated_at disputes. Beijing rejected the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that its territorial claims to most of the South China Sea - within what it calls the \"nine-dash line\" - have no legal basis. \nChina's sweeping claims to the resource-rich waterway are also contested by Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. \nThe latest incident comes as tensions have been rising over Scarborough Shoal. \nThe Datu Sanday was one of three Philippine vessels involved in a confrontation with the Chinese coastguard in December, when Manila accused the coastguard of using water cannon to \"obstruct\" the vessels, which were delivering fuel and food supplies to more than 30 Philippine fishing boats near the shoal. \nChina claimed the boats had \"intruded\" into the waters. \nOn Saturday, the Philippines claimed that Chinese fishermen were using cyanide to catch fish near and \"intentionally destroy\" Scarborough Shoal, an accusation Beijing has denied. Cyanide fishing can damage the ecosystem and has been banned in many places, including the Philippines. \nMeanwhile, the People's Liberation Army on Monday sent naval and air forces to monitor a joint air patrol involving Philippine fighter jets and a US bomber over the South China Sea. \nCopyright (c) 2024.

It's somecreated_ats even questioning the international rules-based order,\" he said.\n\"Therefore, sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries is key and what we can see with respect to Taiwan [and] the South China Sea, but also with respect to border disputes with India, that's concerning because we are convinced that any such disputes need to be solved peacefully and with mutual consent,\" he added.\nThe first-ever China strategy approved by the German government last year covers political, economic and security relations with the region and also focuses on working with other countries such as India, South Korea, Japan, Australia and Singapore, Lindner said.\nLindner rejected the accusation that Europe is only focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and said this issue has repercussions for the Indo-Pacific and even India in terms of food prices and energy security. \"I can assure you we are aware that our own security [and] prosperity is intertwined with the security here,\" he said.\nRussia's actions amount to a \"blatant violation of the international rules-based order\" and their implications affect everyone. \"We know that Germany and India might have a different voting behaviour in the United Nations. But we share a common interest [in the] territorial integrity and sovereignty of countries,\" he said.\nThe peace formula proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy remains the \"only plan on the table right now\", and Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal for ending the conflict is \"similar to an unconditional surrender of Ukraine, and this is something we cannot accept\", he said.\nLindner expressed the hope that India will participate in a peace conference to be hosted by Switzerland for discussions with countries in the Indo-Pacific, Latin America and Africa to find a way out of the Ukraine war.\nGermany remains a staunch supporter of Ukraine, in terms of both military backing and reconstruction of the country, but at the same created_at, Germany needs the entire international community and global partners such as India to \"find a way out of that war\", he said.\nAsked about external affairs minister S Jaishankar's recent remarks that Russia has never harmed India's interests, Lindner sought to draw a parallel between Germany's efforts to end its dependence on Russian energy supplies and India's attempts to diversify its supply chains in the wake of tensions with China.\n\"The lesson [of not being] too dependent on one country alone is something I believe is well understood here...That's also a good security policy because it raises your independence and your sovereignty,\" he said.\nIn this context, he also pointed to India's efforts to procure military hardware such as submarines from Germany and to diversify its international ties by strengthening cooperation with the US and other countries.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan created_ats.

    "text": "\n Thailand faces a scorching day with temperatures peaking at 38 degrees Celsius and scattered thunderstorms in some areas, warns the Meteorological Department of Thailand (TMD). The latest weather forecast anticipates strong southerly and southeasterly winds affecting the northeastern, lower central, and eastern regions of the country, creating the potential for thunderstorms in these areas.\nIn the period from February 24 to February 26, a high-pressure system or cool air mass from China is expected to extend over Vietnam and the South China Sea. Meanwhile, upper Thailand will experience hot weather in many areas. The presence of southerly and southeasterly winds covering the lower northern, northeastern, and central regions, as well as Bangkok and its vicinity, and eastern parts, will lead to thunderstorms, strong gusts, hail in some places, and possible lightning strikes.\nIn the northern region, the upper parts will see cool to cold weather with morning fog, turning hot with clear skies by midday. The lower northern region will have partly cloudy skies with some morning fog, also becoming hot during the day. Minimum temperatures will range from 13 to 23 degrees Celsius, and maximum temperatures will hit 34 to 37 degrees Celsius. Mountain peaks may experience very cold conditions, with lows of 6 to 15 degrees Celsius.\nThe northeastern region will experience cool temperatures in the upper areas with some morning fog, heating up during the day. Thunderstorms are expected in about 10% of the region, mainly in Chaiyaphum, Nakhon Ratchasima, Buri Ram, and Surin. Minimum temperatures will range from 20 to 26 degrees Celsius, and maximum temperatures will be between 36 and 38 degrees Celsius. Again, higher altitudes will be cooler, with minimum temperatures of 15 to 18 degrees Celsius, reported KhaoSod.\nFor the central region, hot daycreated_at weather will be accompanied by thunderstorms in about 10% of the area, predominantly in Lopburi and Saraburi. Temperatures will range from a minimum of 24 to 26 degrees Celsius to a maximum of 35 to 38 degrees Celsius.\nThe eastern region will also experience hot daycreated_at weather, with thunderstorms expected in 10% of the area, mainly in Sa Kaeo, Chon Buri, Chanthaburi, and Trat. Minimum temperatures will range from 23 to 27 degrees Celsius, and maximum temperatures will reach 33 to 38 degrees Celsius. The sea will have waves less than 1 metre high, but in stormy areas, waves could be higher than 1 metre.\nHot weather\nIn the southern region (east coast), hot weather during the day will be accompanied by thunderstorms in about 10% of the area, particularly in Phetchaburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Chumphon, and Surat Thani. The temperature will vary from a low of 22 to 25 degrees Celsius to a high of 31 to 38 degrees Celsius. The sea will see waves about 1 metre high, increasing beyond 1 metre in stormy conditions.\nOn the southern region's west coast, areas including Ranong, Phang-nga, Phuket, and Krabi will experience hot daycreated_at weather with thunderstorms in about 10% of the region. Minimum temperatures will be between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius, and maximum temperatures will range from 34 to 37 degrees Celsius. Sea waves will stay below 1 metre in distance from the shore but can exceed 1 metre during storms.\nBangkok and its vicinity will not be spared from the heat, with hot daycreated_at conditions and the likelihood of thunderstorms in about 10% of the area. The mercury will range from a minimum of 26 to 27 degrees Celsius to a maximum of 34 to 37 degrees Celsius.

One possibility to increase the manpower of our domestic military forces could be based on the conscription system of Switzerland, where I lived for 23 years. All males from age 18 to 30 participate in military training, which consists of initial service of 18 weeks. Over the next nine years, recruits carry on their normal lives and have six refresher courses of three weeks each. Women are also encouraged to sign on.\nThis system causes minimum inconvenience and resentment, and helps bind together a diverse nation of four different official languages. Recruits often train in cantons beyond their own linguistic region. The result is nothing like the controversial conscription by lottery imposed on Australian 20-year-olds in the 1960s to fight the Vietnam War.\nThe Swiss system is widely accepted, even welcomed as a key element of Swiss life which gives young people a sense of discipline and nationhood. But, of course, the major benefit to Switzerland is a large domestic defence force ready to defend the nation in case of invasion. If Australia had a cohort of millions of citizens ready to defend every town and street of our nation, they would be a major deterrent to any possible invader.\nEdmund Doogue, Crawley, WA\nClimate change is the real enemy\nWhat's going on? In its October 2022 submission to the Australian government's defence strategic review, the Australian Security Leaders Climate Group led by Admiral Chris Barrie AC (Retd) and Air Vice-Marshal John Blackburn AO (Retd) and others wrote that \"climate change is the greatest security threat facing Australia, requiring a fundamental reframing of security and defence strategy\".\nOne key finding from the report was \"the existential nature of the climate threat requires a fundamental reframing of Australia's defence and security strategy, away from traditional nation state geopolitics, to focus on unprecedented global co-operation rather than conflict\". The report recommended the removal of subsidies to fossil fuel industries, including the \"$42 billion annually in Australia, roughly equivalent to our current defence budget\".\nSadly, it seems the report has been ignored by the current government, which continues to approve coal mines and subsidise the fossil fuel industry. Defence spending on ocean-going vessels of war has ballooned obscenely to include $368 billion for AUKUS subs and now a further $11 billion on a futuristic \"combatant fleet\" (\"Fears $11b navy boost will leave defence gap\", 21/2).\nMeanwhile the oceans the vessels will patrol are the hottest on record. So much for science and the wisdom of our elders.\nRay Peck, Hawthorn\nOur efforts should be towards peace, not war\nIt is ludicrous to see that we are acquiring a fleet of drone ships to double the navy's number of warships as China rapidly expands its military and asserts itself in the South China Sea. If a conflict were to happen, China would overwhelm Australia in one fell swoop along with our warships. The tactics of war are rapidly changing as we now live in a world where missiles and drones are the new weapons of combat. Rather than playing war games and building our out-of-date arsenal, it would be better to use all efforts to work towards a peaceful world.\nJulie Ottobre, Brunswick East\n"

    "text": "\nFeb. 22—MANILA(Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN) — The shift in policy on the West Philippine Sea (WPS) from Rodrigo Duterte's appeasement to Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.'s assertiveness has raised fears, baseless or not, over the row's impact on China's investments in and trade with the Philippines.\nHere's why.\nAccording to a report by the Research and Special Studies Division of the National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP), \"research focusing on the People's Republic of China and its use of economic statecraft, including economic coercion, has started to emerge in recent years.\"\n\"With its increasing economic clout, being the second largest economy in the world, the world's largest trading state, and the world's largest holder of foreign currency reserves, it is therefore unsurprising that China is using its newfound economic power as leverage in dealing with other states,\" it read.\nAs cited in the article, Jonathan Kirshner, a professor of political science and international studies in the United States, explained that economic coercion, especially on trade, is highly likely. As the NDCP report said, the Philippines has experienced it already after the Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal standoff between the Philippine and Chinese navies in 2012.\nThe report pointed out that China's retaliation was to ban agricultural products, especially bananas, from the Philippines. Chinese citizens were discouraged, too, from visiting the Philippines because of \"security concerns.\"\nThis also was the point made by Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, in a column published by ISEAS-Yusof Ishok Institute.\n\"After all, the weaponization of trade and investments is not new to Beijing's modern statecraft,\" Koh said in the column.\n\"As China remains a major trade partner of the Philippines, one could justifiably assume that Beijing might seek to tighten the economic pressure valve on Manila in retaliation,\" Koh said.\nIt was explained to INQUIRER.net by Herman Joseph Kraft, a professor of political science at the University of the Philippines Diliman, that \"economic sanctions are serious actions taken by states against another.\"\n\"Usually it is taken when one party has crossed a line that is a serious threat to the interests of another,\" Kraft said.\nHowever, Koh pointed out that so far, \"there are no indications of coercive economic reprisals from China,\" especially since the start of the Philippines' strategy of publicizing China's aggression in the South China Sea. This included non-lethal attacks, like aiming military-grade lasers, on Philippine Coast Guard vessels inside the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\nIn 2023, the Chinese Embassy spokesperson said \"China remains the Philippines' largest trading partner, largest source of imports, largest export destination and third largest source of foreign investment under agreements.\"\nThis, he said, has effectively promoted post-pandemic recovery.\nTrading partner?\nPhilippine Statistics Authority (PSA) data in 2023 showed that the Philippines was buying more goods than it was selling to China. Last year, China was the biggest source of imported goods with a value of $29.4 billion that peaked in November that year with $2.72 billion worth of Chinese goods being sold to the Philippines, or 25.1 percent of the Philippines' total imports.\nNext to China were Indonesia ($11.694 billion), Japan ($10.165 billion), and the US ($8.35 billion).\nThe problem, however, is that a good balance of trade is \"one in which the value of domestic goods exported exceeds the value of foreign goods imported,\" said Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics in the US, in an article published by Econlib.\nTaking a look at the balance of trade, the same PSA data showed that in 2023, exports — or Philippine-made goods being sold to China — were worth nearly $11 billion, or just half of what China is selling to the Philippines. March was the peak for exports to China with goods worth $1.4 billion or 21 percent of total Philippine exports that month. The US was the biggest export market with a value of $11.2 billion.\nNext to the US and China were Japan ($10.511 billion) and Hong Kong ($8.390 billion).\nAs explained in the website investopedia.com, when there are too many imports coming into a country in relation to its exports—which are products shipped from that country to a foreign destination—it can distort a nation's balance of trade and devalue its currency.\nLess investments\nMarcos said last year that when he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference summit, \"essentially [...] we were in agreement that the problems [...] in the South China Sea should not be the defining element of our relationship.\"\nOne way economic interest in the Philippines is being measured is through foreign direct investments or FDIs.\nThe Philippines' Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas explained that foreign direct investments \"are an important source of external financing for developing countries,\" stressing that \"given its long-term nature, it provides a stable source of funding for host or receiving economies.\"\nAccording to data from the PSA, approved investments from China from 2016 to the second quarter of 2023 was valued at $163.802 billion, behind Japan, which had $282.355 billion, and Singapore, which had $237.988 billion. The US only had $111.775 billion in approved investments.\nThe data indicated that in both the last quarters of 2018 and 2019, approved investments from China reached P47.985 billion and P86.311 billion. It hit its lowest in the second quarter of 2020 at only P69.70 million.\nThe value of approved agreements in the first year of Marcos was almost the same as in Duterte's.\nAs stressed in a 2017 article by foreign affairs research specialist Edcel John Ibarra and published by the Center for International Relations and Strategic Studies, Japan, the US, and Singapore, which are also significant trading partners, \"are keen to counterbalance an aggressively rising China.\"\nImbalance\nFor Joshua Espeña, vice president of the think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, \"doing nothing or something would hurt the Philippines' economy; our economy is already hurt because of the imbalanced trade.\"\n\"It would imply either looking for other import sources with the same production rate or as close to China or forcing its domestic private sectors to produce more,\" he told INQUIRER.net, stressing, however, that \"the costs will be at the household level in the medium term.\"\n\"But the long-term implication is to help the Filipino economy eventually niche in the global market,\" said Espeña.\n\"So far, doing nothing is already hurting our development plans. If the Philippines wishes to leverage its newfound middle power position, geoeconomics is integral to any rising state actor in the international system,\" he said.\nEspeña, also a lecturer at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, pointed out that should China decide to sanction the Philippines, \"it will hurt us, but it will also hurt China in terms of global supply chain.\"\nFostering economic blocs, he said, is a way forward to consider mini-lateral approaches with certain ASEAN members and like-minded partners, and pushing for the US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\n\"We hedge the sources, but we must craft a pro-Filipino grand strategy to lift the Filipino people to greater heights,\" he said.\nNo economic coercion, yet\nBut despite the more assertive actions taken by the Philippines in securing its rights in the WPS, Kraft said that \"it doesn't seem like it has reached a point where China will resort to economic sanctions.\"\n\"There might be some targeted actions against particular industries that would be tantamount to harassment, but full-blown economic sanctions are not yet likely in the short term and under current circumstances,\" he explained.\nThis was shared by Espeña, who pointed out that \"as far as we are concerned, it is likely that China would think twice about hitting us with economic sanctions hard given the state of their domestic economy whose development model is now geared toward exporting goods and services.\"\n\"Beijing's model has created a monster of making more and imposing it on them. So I think their post-COVID economic policy is to offset the loss of the export hurt exacerbated by its trade war with Washington,\" he said.\n\"We have to take into account that China's disinformation campaign and diplomatic threats are another window of seeing how vulnerable they are without securing the regional supply chain,\" Espeña said.\n\"For instance, China gets most of its nickel sources from the Philippines, so it goes on to suggest we may have more leverage in fostering a geoeconomic agenda of hurting their supply chain,\" he added.\n___ (c)2024 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

Apple is going to reinvent the farm they talk to knock at and I said what do you think of the ICER they all side say of great relief they said it's a c***** firm but every single criteria the matter to them. The number of different downs that the iPhone could talk to the battery power, the quality of the was connection I thought didn't do very well this you catching the face and the application. The software that would revolutionise the fans just didn't register with an just 7 and Taiwan should that matter in front of a crowd of one of America's leading universities and 92-year-old scientist and entrepreneur is passing on his wisdom and experience to the next generation. \nWhen I first arrive in the United States 1949. I bet you that only the scientists only the fitness and some cameras you what this man is Morris change, the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor manufacturing company or tea SMC. Some people argue it is the most important company in the world. Many c Morris Chang is the bridge between the microchip industries of the East and the West. Chris Miller more exchange has been building the ship industry since we early. It was created. He was walking at Texas instruments when Jack kill be invented the first ship in the late 19 50s now. He spent a bit of created_at in Taiwan when tax instruments was opening up a factory there in late. 19 sixties and getting to know the government there and I approached him with the I said we'll give you a large sum of money to start a chip firm if you headquartered in Taiwan. Before this point, almost every company both designed and and manufactured their own ships. But Morris Cheng wanted to do chips sort of like what Gutenberg did for books. He didn't want to write any books, he only wanted to print them, and so he created a company TSMC, which today doesn't design any chips, it only manufactures them, and so today TSMC manufactures ships for many of the world's biggest tech companies Apple and Video, might, Krysoft and others, and as a result it's the world's biggest chip company. The tax sector in the world can't really live without it. In April, 2023 40 years after that, Soviet officer Stanislav Petrov had to take the fateful decision that arguably saved mankind in the South China Sea, Taiwanese forces have detected Chinese vessels conducting military exercises. This created_at the machinery is right, they really are there. Those Chinese warships and planes are not invading but simulating precision strikes. Western concerns are growing that exercises like these might preface a real attack. We have come a long way from the Soviet Union's faulty tech that forced one man in a bunker to decide the fate of the world. But 40 years later, with so many of our chips in one basket in Taiwan, could we be moving towards another conflict that might change everything? Hannah Dorman is a research analyst at Georgetown's Centre for Security and emerging Technology. The consequences of a conflict over Taiwan would really be felt globally and I think it's safe to say, with a much greater impact than Russia's war on Ukraine. Industries would take a big hit. The economy would take a big hit there would be sanctions against Beijing and Beijing's partners countries would be pushed to choose sides. there would be absolutely disruptions to trade and global security. Next created_at, on the rise and rise of the microchip, the United States and China go to to. Before I came to office, the story was about how the People's Republic of China was increasing its power and America's failing in the world. Not any more.\n"

    "text": "\n It is tempting to frame global geopolitics as a binary struggle between China and the US, as a competition between two economic giants, each of which has grown to see the other as the fundamental obstacle to its own security and success.\nYet the world is more complicated than that. International affairs are not moving towards a bipolar world in which two superpowers create rival systems and force all other countries to take sides, but is rather moving to a multipolar world, where there are many great powers all competing against each other.\nMultipolarity is preceded by the disintegration of unipolarity, whereby one hegemonic power finds itself increasingly declining amid a rise of others. Thus, China is not the only rising power to reshape the global environment, even if it is at this created_at the largest, and because of this it is unlikely that Beijing will ever be a hegemon in the same sense as America was, for we must take other rising powers into account such as India and Russia, among others.\nHowever, one often-overlooked country is emerging as geopolitically consequential, and that is Indonesia. This massive, diverse, multiethnic archipelago state is home to 273 million people and is the fourth-most-populated country in the world. It is also one of the fastest-growing economies in Southeast Asia whose Gross Domestic Product surpassed $1 trillion in recent years, having increased at a steady pace over created_at. This makes it one of the world's most important emerging economies and markets.\nThe increasing prominence of Indonesia has led the island nation to become subject to a geopolitical tug of war, that is the question of who will win its 'allegiance' as part of the macro struggle between the US and China. Stretched out across thousands of islands, the geostrategic location of the country is critical, because it occupies the fundamental passage between the Pacific and Indian oceans known as the Malacca Strait, forming an effective bridge between Asia and Oceania, as well as the South China Sea. The West consequently sees the country as essential in attempting to contain China within its own neighbourhood, while Beijing, on the other hand, sees partnership with Indonesia as equally important for the opposite reason.\nBut when it comes to geopolitics, Indonesia is the archetype of a non-aligned nation, as well as an important voice of the Global South, hence the famous Bandung Conference of African and Asian states was held on its territory in 1955. Because of this neutrality and because it is a Muslim nation, Indonesia is not pro-West, but neither is it pro-China. Instead, it pursues a 'best of both worlds' foreign policy which seeks to simultaneously court both sides to derive benefits. As the largest market and economic benefactor on its doorstep, Jakarta cannot ignore Beijing, thus it makes conscious choices in terms of trade, technology (such as Huawei) as well as other things, to align with Beijing.\nOn the other hand, Indonesia naturally does not want to be militarily subjugated by the rise of China and therefore seeks other partners to bolster its own autonomy to ensure it does not become a 'subordinate' party, and is thus also a strategic partner of the US. However, this is the hallmark of a multipolar world, whereby nations sense that they do not have to be subject to the 'hegemony' of a third party and are able to seek multiple options rather than having to follow the orders and preferences of a superior power. Indonesia is thus neither pro-China nor pro-American, it is pro-Indonesia and will use this to become a pivotal power in the future.\nYet, this also inevitably signals the end of Western domination in on a global scale. With the rise of new economies such as Indonesia with its huge population, 'older powers' like Britain and France increasingly become smaller and less relevant. It is one thing to look at the rise of China's economy, but what happens when other economies such as India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nigeria, et al become larger in scope than Western ones thanks to their large populations and markets? There is an undeniable shift in the balance of power going on here, and this of course also means American dominance cannot last forever. The US, and thus China too, must ultimately win the allegiance and court these new tier economies, thus ending the Euro-Atlantic dominance of global affairs which has lasted for four hundred years. This is precisely why America is now so-focused on what it describes as 'The Indo-Pacific' and countries like Indonesia will ultimately serve as kingmakers as they establish their global influence.\n"

    "text": "\nAPSC needs to ensure a level playing field\nThrough the columns of your esteemed daily, we would like to bring to the attention of the Hon'ble Chief Minister, Assam, and the Hon'ble Chairman, APSC, that the optional subjects in CCE (Mains) were abolished last year by the Hon'ble Chief Minister to ensure level playing field for the aspirants because earlier it was seen in CCE (Mains) that some candidates secured as high as 244 out of 250 marks in a certain optional subject paper. As a result, such candidates used to gain an upper hand to crack the exam. On the other hand, due to average and low scores in other optional subjects, some deserving candidates could not make it to the final list. As such, it can be inferred that optional subjects hampered the level-playing field for the aspirants, which was against the ethics of merit-based competition. Therefore, in a welcome move, the government abolished the optional subjects to ensure a level-playing field for the aspirants.\nHowever, in the recently declared result of the CCE 2022 exam, it is seen that a candidate has scored 245 out of 250 in the essay paper. It has not only destroyed the idea of 'level-playing field' but also caused utter dismay for the aspirants. The concerned authorities need to take adequate measures to ensure a level playing field for all aspirants. A set of guidelines by which examiners allot marks needs to be framed to ensure transparency and fairness. Indeed, the fairness of competition depends on the criteria that not only each player has an equal chance to succeed but that they all play by the same set of rules.\nSome aspirants,\nGuwahati\nVoters are taken\nfor granted!\nOnly men of character and integrity can help provide their services to nation building. Legislators, or MLAs, are law-makers. In essence, the role and responsibilities of an MLA involve serving as a bridge between the government and the people, ensuring effective governance, and advocating for the well-being of their constituencies and the state as a whole. It is a position of public trust that requires dedication, integrity, and a strong commitment to public service.\nMLAs/MPs are elected directly by the people of their respective constituencies. As such, they are directly accountable to them. However, they fail to realize that voters are their guardians. After getting elected, things get reversed. MLAs and MPs become the masters of the voters. They do whatever they want, disregarding all social norms. The trend to shift sides by any MLA or MP overnight has become an accepted norm in the politics of the day. We know for sure that different parties have different ideologies. It's difficult to understand how a politician from one party can transition to another overnight. Ideology is not water that takes the shape of the vessel where it is put. Ideology refers to a system of beliefs, values, ideas, and principles that guide and shape a society's politics, economics, and other aspects of life.\nIt is unethical for any legislator to jump the fence at his own sweet will, without the consent of the voters, or without resigning from the membership of the party in the first place. It is not evident how he or she expects that voters will shift sides with him or her. They consider the voters to be use and throw items and nothing more than that. In fact, we don't expect anything worthwhile from self-serving politicians of any hue whatsoever. This is how our legislators are taking the voters for granted and doing whatever they want to do. We must ensure that only men and women of principle, integrity, and commitment are allowed to serve people and the nation.\nPrafulla Dowarah,\nGuwahati\nUS-India\nties on a roll\nWest Asia, Ukraine, and the Indo-Pacific are areas of grave concern for the United States and India. China's aggressive posturing in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean has propelled friendly nations, which include the two, to join hands to thwart its designs. By the same token, bilateral ties between Washington and New Delhi are on the upswing, notwithstanding minor distractions like the case of an Indian \"agent\" accused of hatching a conspiracy to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the US. However, Washington intends to supply New Delhi with 31 MQ-9B predator drones, marking a step forward in Indo-US relations. Maricreated_at cooperation between Washington and New Delhi is on a roll.\nExternal Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar's recent meeting with his US counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on the sidelines of the Munich security conference was aimed at reassuring India's commitment to all areas of bilateral concern and mutual benefit. It was Blinken who declared the US' support for India in areas like defence cooperation, Afghanistan, and health security when the two met a couple of years ago, soon after he took over as secretary of state, besides his country's unflinching support for India in the Indo-Pacific theatre. In Munich, Blinken described the bilateral relationship as among the most consequential of any relations in the world for the US.\nDr Ganapathi Bhat\n(gbhat13@gmail.com)\n"

But unfortunately, the PRC often takes actions that undermine those principles, rather than reinforcement,\" Kritenbrink said, citing Beijing's expansion into the South China Sea, economic coercion of smaller states and programmes opposing \"universal\" human rights. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \n\"The PRC has become more repressive at home and more aggressive abroad,\" he told the conference. \"The PRC is advancing an alternative vision for global governance.\" \nPanellists pushed back, however, including those from developing countries, arguing that the battle for influence is too often framed as a binary choice between Beijing and Washington - when the reality is more nuanced. \n\"The developing world conceals a multiplicity of interests,\" said Bilahari Kausikan, chairman of the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute. \"We have concerns about both certain aspects of Chinese behaviour and certain aspects of American behaviour.\" \nKritenbrink said that US policy toward the Global South is not defined in opposition to China, nor does it force countries to choose. Rather, he contended, it promotes the vision of \"a world where rules, norms and institutions prevail over outdated and dangerous concepts of might making right . \nHe added, however, that it would be naive to believe that China doesn't enter into US calculations. \"Of course, we can't deny that strategic competition is also a critical part of this moment,\" Kritenbrink, a former US ambassador to Vietnam, said. \n\"Our relationship with the PRC is one of intense strategic competition. At the same created_at, the United States is committed to managing this competition responsibly, so that it does not veer into miscalculation, or conflict.\" \nKritenbrink criticised the major elements of China's outreach - the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, Global Civilization Initiative and the Belt and Road Initiative - as programmes that undercut collective defence and environmental standards and seek to reframe human rights as a privilege of the West. \nPanellists at the conference said the \"Global South\" phrase is baggage-laden - a replacement for the now-discredited \"Third World\". Countries concentrated in the southern hemisphere often have little in common other than some vague sense that the Global North is too dominant even as Beijing and Washington jockey for their loyalty - and UN votes. \n\"It doesn't mean that these countries, however resentful they may be about different aspects of Western policy, are going to drink deeply of Chinese Kool-Aid,\" Kausikan said. \nBut, he added, China \"understands the mood that constitutes the Global South better than the West and avoids what I will call sanctimonious diplomacy, insisting that its interpretation of values is the only possible interpretation\". \nChina's recent economic slowdown - fuelled by a property crisis, rising youth unemployment, battered confidence and swooning financial markets - is likely to shift Beijing's Global South emphasis, panellists said. \nSince 2015, China's spending on Belt and Road Initiative projects has been tapering off. Its slowing economy will also see it place more focus on less expensive programmes, experts said, including more training of foreign militaries, joint defence meetings, telecommunication infrastructure projects and use of the People's Liberation Army in quasi-political foreign outreach roles. \n\"Because Chinese feel more cornered in a way, with reduced options, it's going to use more diversity of tools for influence that are cheaper than just investing in big infrastructure projects,\" Nadege Rolland, a China fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research, said, adding that this would not change Beijing's focus on countering the US. \n\"It's not like these countries are pawns in the hands of Beijing, but Beijing certainly sees them as such and so it's a very binary vision of the rejection of the existing order.\" \nChina's adaptive tactics are particularly evident in Africa, said Paul Nantulya, an African studies research associate with the US National Defence University. \n\"The Chinese side educates more African officers than any other industrialised country. And this becomes extremely important,\" he said. \"I don't think that the Chinese government puts all its eggs in one basket.\" \nAs the stakes and rhetoric mount between the world's two largest economies, Kritenbrink said that Washington remains focused on convincing - not arm-twisting - developing countries with revitalised alliances, financing projects and ties involving the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Summit for Democracy, US-Pacific Island Country Summit and Africa outreach programmes. \n\"We don't want countries to have to choose between us and the PRC,\" he said. \"But we want to help ensure that they have a choice and that they can make their decisions free from coercion.\" \nCopyright (c) 2024.

    "text": "\nA PHILIPPINE coast guard official on Thursday belied its Chinese counterpart’s claim that a fishery vessel had “illegally intruded” into Beijing’s waters.\n“This statement is inaccurate,” Commodore Jay Tristan Tarriela, the coast guard’s spokesman on South China Sea issues, told reporters. “The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) vessel, BRP Datu Sanday, continues to patrol the waters of Bajo De Masinloc.”\nHe said the ship is actively ensuring the security of Filipino fishermen in the area.\nThe Chinese Coast Guard earlier in the day said it had driven away a Philippine vessel and accused it of “illegally intruding” into its waters near Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea.\nLocated within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ), Scarborough Shoal is also claimed by China, making it one of Asia’s most contested maricreated_at features and a flashpoint for flare-ups.\nChina claims almost the entire South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion in annual ship commerce. Its territorial claims overlap with those of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei.\nIn 2016, an international arbitration tribunal in the Hague said China’s claims had no legal basis, a decision Beijing has rejected\nMr. Tarriela said the Philippines’ transparency campaign in the South China Sea might soon focus on food security to get the support of other Southeast Asian countries.\nThe Philippines this month started patrols around Scarborough Shoal as China continues to bar Filipino fishermen from their traditional fishing ground that Beijing has occupied since 2012.\n“I predict that our transparency efforts will shift to highlight issues such as food security, the welfare of the Filipino fishery and the protection of the marine environment,” he separately told a forum.\nThe Philippines under President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. has been exposing China’s repeated attempts to block resupply missions at Second Thomas Shoal, embedding journalists in these missions so they can report the incidents at sea.\nMr. Tarriela said silence of other Southeast Asian nations on “China’s provocative and unlawful tactics” is apparent.\nHe said the Philippines does not expect its neighbors to support its standing up to China because some of them are claimant states and most of them do not want to provoke China.\n“To appease or receive some support from these countries, we need to flip our transparency approach,” he said. “Instead of focusing on the swarming of Chinese vessels or resupply operations, we would focus on food security or protection of fishermen.\n“With this kind of transparency, we can expect that our Southeast Asian neighbors will somehow support us,” he added.\nScarborough Shoal has been the focus of Philippine government missions in the South China Sea this month, as the country seeks to ensure Filipino fishermen’s access to the low-tide elevation, which is locally called Bajo de Masinloc.\nLast week, the Philippine fisheries bureau said Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen had been using cyanide in Scarborough Shoal.\nBFAR spokesman Nazario C. Briguera on Feb. 17 said “the Chinese intentionally destroy Bajo de Masinloc to prevent Filipino fishing boats from fishing in the area.” Damage to the shoal has been estimated at more than P1 billion.\nMr. Tarriela said the President had ordered the Philippine Coast Guard and BFAR to conduct joint scientific research to determine whether Chinese fishermen were behind the cyanide use. The agencies will work with the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute, he added.\nThe shoal is 240 kilometers west of the main Philippine island of Luzon and is about 900 kilometers from Hainan, the nearest major Chinese landmass.\nMr. Tarriela said they expect Chinese disinformation to proliferate in the Philippines as it nears midterm elections in 2025.\n“Politicians may exploit patriotic sencreated_atnts for their own gain,” he said. “Politicians may prioritize delivering speeches and pushing their own political agenda without definitely considering the potential repercussions on our national security and foreign policy.”\nAn OCTA Research Group poll in December showed 77% of Filipinos support increased military activities within the Philippine EEZ in the South China Sea, up from 65% in October.\nMr. Tarriela said the Philippines is expected to gain the support of more countries as it confronts China’s aggression within Philippine territories.\n“This increase in support is driven by the rising interest of international journalists in exposing China’s unlawful behavior,” he said. “Their cameras, pens and the power of social media platforms are instrumental in sharing factual narratives.”\n‘LEGAL HIGH GROUND’\nMeanwhile, the Philippines should push the creation of an international coalition with its neighbors to pressure China to stop its dredging and large-scale clam harvesting that is destroying marine life in the South China Sea, Gregory B. Poling senior fellow and director of the Southeast Asia Program and Asia Maricreated_at Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told a media briefing in Mandaluyong City .\n“Any effort to physically prevent [China’s aggression] is going to be hopeless, they’ve got more boats than anytext else combined,” he said.\nHe added that the coalition should check the marine damage and negotiate for a joint marine scientific fishery research and invite China to join. “China will probably say no.”\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately reply to a Viber message seeking comment.\nBased on a CSIS study in December, China’s dredging and giant clam harvesting has damaged at least 21,000 acres of coral reefs in the waterway.\nVietnam has also been building outposts in the area, damaging at least 1,500 acres of coral reefs through dredging. The Philippines, Malaysia and Taiwan have damaged fewer than 100 acres of coral reefs in the South China Sea, according to the study.\nMr. Poling said countries are more inclined to follow international law if their actions cost them too much reputational and economic damage.\nThe Philippine Senate on Wednesday passed on second reading a bill that seeks to set up maricreated_at zones and territories in the South China Sea.\nMr. Polling, who had participated in committee hearings, told reporters the measure is unlikely to deter China from intruding into Philippine-claimed areas in the waterway.\n“There needs to be a slow accumulation of pressure and what the Maricreated_at Zones Act will do is to further build up the Philippines’ moral and legal high ground by bringing domestic law more into obvious compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Law on the Sea,” he said.\n“This is not a silver bullet, but the fact is that China has suffered very little reputational costs for this behavior and that needs to change, and it cannot be just the Philippines out there imposing its cause as it has for too many years,” he added.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Chinese coastguard has said it drove off a Philippine vessel that had \"illegally intruded\" into waters near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea - a claim contested by the Philippines.  \nIn a statement yesterday, the coastguard said it chased away the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) ship - which it identified by the number 3002 - in accordance with the law. It did not give further details of the incident. \nThe BFAR vessel is the BRP Datu Sanday, a ship that was previously used for resupply missions to disputed islands and atolls in the South China Sea, including Scarborough Shoal. \nThe Philippine coastguard yesterday disputed Beijing's claim, saying the statement was \"inaccurate\" and that the Datu Sanday was still patrolling in waters near the shoal.  \n\"Currently, the BFAR vessel is actively ensuring the security of Filipino fishermen in that area,\" Commodore Jay Tarriela, a coastguard spokesman, said on X. \"Some of our media friends are embedded on board the BFAR vessel, and their forthcoming reports upon completion of the mission will confirm the accuracy of our statement.\" \nManila announced last week that Philippine coastguard and BFAR vessels would be sent to the shoal from this month \"to protect the rights and safety of Filipino fishermen\" in the waters. \nThat came after China's ­coastguard last month said it had chased away four Filipinos who had \"illegally\" entered the waters. \nBoth China and the Philippines lay claim to Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing ground in the middle of the South China Sea. The shoal is located around 220km west of the Philippine island of Luzon and about 1,000km east of Hainan Island.  \nChina took control of the shoal in 2012 after a tense stand-off, prompting Manila to launch an arbitration case over their maricreated_at disputes. Beijing rejected the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that its territorial claims to most of the South China Sea - within what it called the \"nine-dash line\" - had no legal basis.  \nChina's sweeping claims to the resource-rich waterway are also contested by Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei.  \nThe latest incident comes as tensions have been rising over Scarborough Shoal.  \nThe Datu Sanday was one of three Philippine vessels involved in a confrontation with the Chinese coastguard in December, when Manila accused the ­coastguard of using water cannon to \"obstruct\" the vessels, which were delivering fuel and food ­supplies to Philippine fishing boats near the shoal.  \nChina claimed the boats had \"intruded\" into the waters. \nOn Saturday, the Philippines claimed that Chinese fishermen were using cyanide to catch fish near and \"intentionally destroy\" Scarborough Shoal, an accusation Beijing has denied.  \nCyanide fishing can damage the ecosystem and has been banned in many places, including the Philippines. \nMeanwhile, the People's Liberation Army on Monday sent naval and air forces to monitor a joint air patrol involving Philippine fighter jets and a United States bomber over the South China Sea.\n"

The Chinese Defense Ministry could not be reached for comment.\nGan said the Chinese side was \"rational and restrained,\" but it reserved the right to \"take additional control measures\" to protect China's \"indisputable sovereignty\" over the area.\nChina's leaders have long relied on unspecified historical rights to justify the country's sweeping claims to all of the physical features in the South China Sea, through which vital shipping lanes carry trillions of dollars worth of goods each year.\nThe Philippines—a long-created_at ally the United States is treaty-bound to defend—lost de facto control of Scarborough Shoal in 2012 during a standoff with the Chinese navy. American forces did not to intervene.\nManila took Beijing to court in The Hague over the dispute, and in 2016 an international tribunal ruled against the Chinese claims, which were found to be inconsistent with the U.N. Law of the Sea treaty, commonly called UNCLOS. The Chinese government ignored the verdict, leaving the Philippines with little recourse.\nThe submerged reef is located about 120 miles from Philippine shores—within its exclusive economic zone—and almost 700 miles from the nearest Chinese province. There are concerns that China could build and militarize a man-made island there, just as it has done in at least three locations in the contested Spratly Islands archipelago.\nAfter diplomatic protests from Manila to Beijing largely fell on deaf ears, the recent flare-ups around the reef came amid the Philippine government's first concerted effort in recent years to assert sovereignty and traditional fishing rights in the area.\nThe White House has repeated its commitment to defend Philippines forces against an armed attack, including in the South China Sea, and the U.S. has sent military assets to the area in a show of resolve. China says the Philippines has roped in an extra-regional power to stir up trouble.\nOngoing Philippine patrols at Scarborough Shoal were to \"ensure the safety of Filipino fishermen in the area and to safeguard them from further harassment,\" said Tarriela, the coast guard spokesperson. The fisheries bureau was distributing fuel to fisherfolk \"to support their prolonged fishing activities,\" he said.\nShip-tracking data shared to X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday by Ray Powell, director of the Stanford-affiliated SeaLight project, showed the Philippine government boat still operating around the shoal, after the Chinese coast guard released a previous similar statement claiming an expulsion.\nManila last week announced the start of \"rotational deployment\" at Scarborough Shoal, with the Philippine Coast Guard and the Philippine Navy alternating by each sending vessels to the area for about a week.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nChina Coast Guard Claims Expelled Philippine Boat\nTED ALJIBE/AFP via Getty Images\nThis photo taken on February 16 shows Philippine fishermen aboard their wooden boats, center left and second left, and Philippine fisheries bureau personnel aboard their rigid hull inflatable boat, front center, sailing past a Chinese coast guard ship, top, near the China-controlled Scarborough Shoal, in disputed waters of the South China Sea.

    "text": "\nThe China Coast Guard announced on Thursday that it had expelled a vessel from the Philippine bureau of fisheries and aquatic resources for illegally intruding into waters near Huangyan Island in the South China Sea.\nThis is the latest in a series of law enforcement actions by the CCG in the waters over the past three weeks. The actions to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been necessitated by the repetitive incursions of Philippine vessels into the Chinese waters.\nAs a close ally of the US in the Asia-Pacific, the Philippines is an example of a country falling victim to the \"at the table or on the menu \"choice Washington is offering countries.\nAt the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, while discussing with his Indian and German counterparts the United States' \"strategic competition\" with China, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said \"If you're not at the table in the international system, you're going to be on the menu\" noting it was very important for the US to reengage multilaterally, which it has done by pressuring countries to make a choice between the US and China.\nManila has put itself in a dilemma by giving in to such pressure. Over the past few months, it has done the US' bidding by incessantly provoking and confronting China. In doing so, it has damaged relations with its major trading partner, investor and friendly neighbor. By accepting Washington's word that it has its full support for its maricreated_at claims, Manila has discarded the long-term tacit understanding it had with Beijing that their territorial disputes should not hinder Sino-Philippine economic and trade cooperation. Rather than being ushered to the seat \"at the table\" by the US, the Philippines has made itself a main course on the US' menu.\nCompared with the other countries that also have maricreated_at disputes with China in the South China Sea, such as Malaysia and Vietnam, which keep a good balance between their relations with China and the US, winning the respect of both sides, the one-sided pro-US policy the Ferdinand Marcos Jr government has recklessly adopted seriously squeezes the strategic space for the Philippines to strive for its national interests amid the intensified interactions between China and the US.\nBeijing's forbearance will wear thin if Manila persists with its frequent provocations. The otherwise booming Sino-Philippine economic and trade cooperation will unavoidably be affected to an extent that Manila will regret, as the US cannot fill the gap that will be left by China.\nThe Philippines only has some outdated patrol ships and planes, which the US requires the Philippines to reserve for the purpose of provoking China, and what the Philippines can obtain from the US is really quite limited.\nLast but not least, that Marcos' call for regional countries to work together against China has largely met with cold shoulders demonstrates that those countries that are still at the table of the US have seen clearly how the Philippines has downgraded itself from the US' dinner guest to a consumable on its menu by surrendering its strategic autonomy.\n \n"

    "text": "\nWhy renouncing Article 9 of Japan's Constitution might be what the US needs\nCourtesy of FOX Business\nChinese and U.S. relations have been steadily worsening over the past few years, especially as China illegitimately seeks more territorial control.\nDane Mizuno, Contributing Columnist November 13, 2020\nEarly last month, the United States' highest diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, made his first visit in over a year to arguably one of the United States' closest allies, Japan. His visit to the island nation comes at a created_at when geopolitical tensions with China are at an all-created_at high due to China's attempts to grow their sphere of influence.\nThe Trump administration's solution to China's growing power has been to instigate a trade war, and it would be understatement to say that it has been an utter failure. The trade war has done more harm than good, with the decimation of the U.S. soybean industry and an overall increased trade deficit. Effectively, we have economically shot ourselves in the foot.\nThese concerning developments combined with the recent election have brought up questions about how Joe Biden's incoming administration will take on the monumental task of keeping the growing influence of China in check.\nWill we see a return to the Trans-Pacific Partnership of the Barack Obama era or a continuation of a bold, but ultimately ineffective, trade war?\n It may be worth considering a different solution altogether in taking the fight to China-rearming Japan as a mode of deterrence and signal of intent. However, in order for this to happen, Japan's contentious Article 9 of its Constitution-which renounces Japan's possession of the military-must be amended. The failed efforts of the previous Abe administration have shown that this will be a monumental task to achieve, but perhaps all that is needed is encouragement and support from the U.S. It is created_at for one of our most economically robust allies to take initiative and bulk up its presence in the East and the South China Sea, making it clear to China that they should back down.\nWhile this may sound like a solution that would take us to war, the truth is we have already been mired in a cold war for some created_at. China has been undermining the sovereignty of its neighbors for years now. Territorial disputes with Japan regarding the Senkaku Islands and increased military presence near Philippines's Thitu Island are two of many incidents that have recently shown that China will stop at nothing to expand and increase its power in the region. \nIn addition to that, the recent implementation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong-which compromises Hong Kong's autonomy-has shown that China sees through empty condemnations from the international community for its actions. Furthermore, the 2016 ruling by the International Court of Justice in Hague, stating that China has no right to declare historic claims to islands in the South China Sea, shows that legal rulings will not have an effect on this regime. Rather, all China cares about is the hegemonic spread of its authoritarian principles, lacking any fear of consequences for its egregious violations of other nations' sovereignty. \nJapan has taken little action in response to all of the turmoil caused by China.  Japan's laid-back attitude may stem from witnessing countries like Hong Kong and India-who are at the tip of China's spear-suffer major repercussions. After all, China is Japan's largest trading partner and a driving force of Japan's tourism industry, so any deterioration in relations could have detrimental effects on the Japanese economy. \nWhile all of these fears of going against China are valid, it represents very short-term thinking regarding primarily the value of these economic benefits. The long-term fear is that China's efforts to dominate the South China Sea are only its first step in reducing the West's profound influence in the region. Xi Jinping's recent visit to Japan is an example of an ongoing trend of Japan coaxing China into a favorable diplomatic relationship, but all this will achieve is the same effect of appeasement that failed Neville Chamberlain and England leading up to World War II. Simply chastising authoritarian leaders for bad behavior will only enable them to continue that behavior. Moreover, it will cause China to give us a sequel to World War II, with Jinping's ever-developing nation attempting to expand through repressive means.\nThe U.S. is going to need the help of the world's third biggest economy to tackle this issue after Trump's tariff wars have shown that the U.S. does not have the ability to keep China in check alone. The Trump administration has alienated its relations with its allies and put multilateralism in peril, leaving the Biden administration to repair relations with long-standing allies. After all, Pax Americana cannot exist with ruptured international relationships and continued illegitimate expansion by China. \nFinding a way to keep China in check might not be a bad way to start repairing these relations. The U.S. has a responsibility to act as leader in world affairs and support those affected by Chinese oppression. Perhaps encouraging Japan to renounce Article 9 might be what the U.S. needs to work together and overcome this crisis. \nAs a new administration takes office in January, we need to encourage careful consideration of foreign policy initiatives, not just domestic ones. China's growth by repressive means is putting world peace at stake for everyone, not just its neighbors.\n"

In the arena of conventional warfare, the CDS said that he learnt that if the enemy had four options, he will look at a fifth. \nIn informal war, there are more options the enemy has. And to do that, it is necessary to be proactive, in terms of intelligence gathering and quick reaction tactics and also, coordination with different agencies. In fact, it is also important to look beyond boundaries and work with partners and friends.\n Speaking about grey zone warfare, he suggested that it was in evidence in the South China Sea and along India's northern borders. The Chinese way, he said l, was not military action but military positioning and not look at immediate dividends, but much later. And for that, things have to be looked at in different ways.\n"

    "text": "\nIn a move likely to escalate tensions with Beijing, the United States has authorised the sale of military equipment to Taiwan, potentially drawing criticism from China while emphasising Washington's commitment to Taiwan's security. Amidst growing geopolitical tensions in the region, the United States has approved a Foreign Military Sale to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States worth $75m. The sale includes the Taiwan Advanced Tactical Data Link System Upgrade Planning and related equipment and support services. The decision, announced by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, shows Washington's commitment to Taiwan's defence and security but is likely to provoke reactions from Beijing, which considers Taiwan a renegade province. \nThe move comes during heightened military manoeuvres by China in the Taiwan Strait and increased pressure on the self-governing island. The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is currently an issue of concern for the US, per GlobalData's intelligence on the US defence market. The US and the Philippines jointly conducted military patrols over the South China Sea to counter Chinese aggression and assert regional stability. The patrols, involving air and naval forces, coincided with heightened tensions following Chinese coastguard vessels' recent altercation with a Filipino outpost.  The proposed sale includes Cross Domain Solutions, High Assurance devices, Global Positioning System receivers, communications equipment, and technical services to enhance Taiwan's ability to modernise its armed forces and maintain a credible defensive capability. According to the State Department, the sale aligns with US law and policy, supporting Taiwan's efforts to counter current and future threats in the region. While the US asserts that the sale will not alter the military balance in the region, China has consistently opposed arms sales to Taiwan, viewing them as interference in its internal affairs. Beijing has warned of severe consequences and has called on Washington to adhere to the \"One China\" principle, which considers Taiwan an inseparable part of Chinese territory. At the beginning of the new year, China announced sanctions on five defence firms over weapons sales to Taiwan. Despite this, the US Department of Defense awarded a contract modification to Raytheon a month later, awarding the production and delivery of 50 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) air-to-surface missiles for Taiwan, worth $68.4m.  The approval of the sale shows the Biden administration's commitment to strengthening ties with Taiwan, a strategically important partner. However, it also risks further exacerbating tensions between the world's two largest economies, adding to friction over trade, human rights, and territorial disputes. As the sale progresses, questions remain about its potential impact on regional stability and the broader US-China relationship. With both sides increasingly flexing their military muscles, the sale of military technology to Taiwan is likely to be met with opposition from Beijing, raising concerns about the risk of escalation and the prospects for peaceful resolution of longstanding disputes in the region.\n"

    "title": "Trade deal between India, European Free Trade Association likely within a few days, says Norwegian Minister",
    "created_at": "2024-02-23",
    "text": "\n The Free Trade Agreement between India and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) is in the final stages and is expected to be concluded within the next few days, Norway’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andreas Motzfeldt Kravik said on Thursday, February 22,2024.\n“We’re hopeful that we can conclude this now in the forthcoming few days. We will see how it goes. Of course, everything is still under discussion and we have to see how things play out. But we’re very optimistic. We have been at this now for several years and we’ve had very intense discussions. The respective Ministers from both sides, in terms of trade and trade policies, have been personally involved. I met with Mr. Piyush Goyal and discussed this. Again, we are very optimistic,” Mr. Kravik told The Hindu on the sidelines of the ongoing Raisina Dialogue. The EFTA consists of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.\nThe 21st round of negotiations for the trade deal were held in New Delhi from January 8 to 13. However, a possible matter of concern for India, on which there is no clarity, is the clause in the draft agreement that could delay access to affordable, generic versions of patented drugs in India by a minimum of six years, as reported by The Hindu last week. \nAccording to a leaked draft, within six months of the trade agreement being signed, signatories should include a “specific duration” during which pharmaceutical companies applying to their country’s regulators for permission to sell a drug would not rely on “undisclosed test data” — in this case, data on the drug’s efficacy and impact on people — to gain market approval for at least six years.\nDuring his visit, Mr. Kravik said he had held discussions on global issues, such as the situations in Gaza, Ukraine and the Red Sea, as well as on Norway’s bilateral relationship with India. Advocating greater economic collaboration between the two countries, he said, “India is now a leader in the global South and also an ascending power, a potential forthcoming superpower, and a culture that we want to collaborate more with.”\nResponding to a question on the situation in the Red Sea, where the Houthis continue to target commercial shipping, Mr. Kravik said that as sea faring nations India and Norway were very much aligned on this issue. The fact is that there is a non-state stakeholder attacking civilian vessels in the Red Sea, inhibiting commercial maricreated_at traffic which is something that cannot be accepted or tolerated, Mr. Kravik noted. \n“I spoke to your Foreign Minister about this, and he mentioned he had recently been to Iran to lay down a few markers, saying that this is not something that can stand and that Iran needs... what it can do to prevent this. And I was also recently in Iran. I had the same message, also been clear directly towards the Houthis that this is not something that is acceptable, both from a standpoint of international law, from a standpoint of commercial international traffic, and not something that is tolerable from an international legal perspective,” he said, expressing hope that durable solutions can be found so that the Red Sea route can be opened again.\nOn the war in Ukraine, which will complete two years on February 24, Mr. Kravik condemned it as a catastrophe in international violation of the UN charter. He termed it an issue that transcends geography, adding that it was not possible to accept that one country, Russia, has attacked another country, Ukraine, in “blatant violation” of international law.\n“We have an equal responsibility. Countries such as India, Norway and other countries in the global South just as in the global north have to speak out against such violations of international law, just as we have to speak out when there are violations, for instance, in the Red Sea, the South China Sea, or the Gaza strip,” he said. “We have to be very principled and clear-eyed about these fundamental forms that have to be adhered to,” he added. \n"

    "text": "\nThe world is in turmoil. The war in Ukraine grinds on, with persistent calls for the United States to continue supplying Ukraine's war effort. China may be poised to invade Taiwan in the coming years and assert its ambitions throughout the South China Sea and elsewhere in East Asia. Israel continues its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, with no end in sight. US troops remain ensconced in Syria and Iraq, and continue to be attacked by Iranian proxies throughout the region.\nThis international turmoil, and the constant calls for US military intervention, ignore the very real costs and consequences to the United States. Supplying ever-more munitions to Ukraine has already induced critical shortages in US munitions and ignores the danger of escalating the war with Russia. Acting as though a new cold war with China is inevitable only serves to make such a conflict more likely. Going to war to maintain the independence of Taiwan means risking nuclear war over a small island 7,000 miles from California. Keeping US soldiers in the Middle East, despite widespread opposition throughout the region, places these men and women at great risk for nebulous purposes and further destabilizes a region that is already in chaos.\nThe status quo American foreign policy - based on a desire for American global primacy - does not adequately promote American interests or prosperity, and in fact harms both. The United States is remarkably safe. It is surrounded by weak neighbors and two oceans and possesses a strong nuclear deterrent and overwhelming conventional military capabilities. The United States does not need to go abroad seeking enemies to destroy, to paraphrase John Quincy Adams. A new US foreign policy based on the principles of realism and restraint would serve American interests much better.\nThe many deleterious effects of the post-9/11 American foreign policy have become abundantly clear. By no standard were the long US military occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan a success, though the war in Afghanistan did enable the killing of al-Qaeda leaders. These forever wars led to tremendous costs in lives, treasure, and regional stability. The Global War on Terror in all its incarnations has produced not only foreign policy failures but also massive domestic surveillance programs and militarized law enforcement tactics, all of which seem to have become institutionalized. It has also significantly harmed American financial prosperity. Brown University's Costs of War Project estimates that the post-9/11 wars have cost American taxpayers more than $8 trillion. This total does not include the many ongoing costs associated with subsidizing wealthy US allies' security, the lingering healthcare costs for a generation of veterans, nor the many costs associated with current US trade policy, sanctions, and tariff regimes that are ineffective at producing behavioral change abroad.\nHow to change this seemingly intractable set of policies politically is a major challenge, but the path forward is clear. America's burgeoning defense spending (the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act authorized $842 billion in spending for the Defense Department) is driven by needless foreign wars and military deployments spurred by nebulous but expansive \"national interests.\" To be sure, the United States should not allow other regional hegemons to emerge, but a weakened and declining Russia is not a viable candidate and China's geography and domestic challenges make it far from inevitable that it will become a threat to the United States rather than a challenge to be managed. Rather, the United States must reorient away from the need for global military primacy and decrease military spending. It should stop subsidizing wealthy allies' security (especially with Europe, South Korea, and Japan). If these allies are concerned about aggressive neighbors they can increase their own military spending to deter aggression rather than free ride on the United States. \nThe US should pursue energy independence, which will have significant financial benefits and ease pressures to remain engaged in the Middle East (and invite attacks by Iran and non-state actors in the region). It must find ways to decrease tensions with China (the American goal must be to peacefully coexist with China) and head off a trade war and possible future military conflict. Lastly, it should stop using economic sanctions and similar means to harm other states; these instruments are ineffective and simply harm American economic interests without securing meaningful concessions from other powers.\nWhile it seems unlikely that a second Biden administration would reverse course on its foreign policy, there is hope that a second Trump administration would follow Trump's gut instincts - if his administration is not captured by hawkish policy advisors - and pursue a foreign policy that is grounded in realism, restraint, and prudence.\n"

    "text": "\nChina enjoys the best of both worlds, benefiting from the global stability that the United States has fostered even as it undermines that stability in areas where it suits its interests, a senior US State Department official said on Wednesday. \nThe comments by Daniel Kritenbrink, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, made at the start of a two-day Atlantic Council conference on China and the Global South come as Beijing and Washington vie for influence among developing countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia. \n\"The PRC [People's Republic of China] has itself benefited from the stability and the opportunity that the international order provides. But unfortunately, the PRC often takes actions that undermine those principles, rather than reinforcement,\" Kritenbrink said, citing Beijing's expansion into the South China Sea, economic coercion of smaller states and programmes opposing \"universal\" human rights. \n\"The PRC has become more repressive at home and more aggressive abroad,\" he told the conference. \"The PRC is advancing an alternative vision for global governance.\" \nPanellists pushed back, however, including those from developing countries, arguing that the battle for influence was too often framed as a binary choice between Beijing and Washington - when the reality was more nuanced. \n\"The developing world conceals a multiplicity of interests,\" said Bilahari Kausikan, chairman of the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute. \"We have concerns about both certain aspects of Chinese behaviour and certain aspects of American behaviour.\" \nKritenbrink said that US policy toward the Global South was not defined in opposition to China, nor did it force countries to choose. Rather, he contended, it promoted the vision of \"a world where rules, norms and institutions prevail over outdated and dangerous concepts of might making right\". \nHe added, however, that it would be naive to believe that China did not enter into US calculations.  \n\"Of course, we can't deny that strategic competition is also a critical part of this moment,\" Kritenbrink, a former US ambassador to Vietnam, said. \"Our relationship with the PRC is one of intense strategic competition. At the same created_at, the United States is committed to managing this competition responsibly, so that it does not veer into miscalculation, or conflict.\" \nKritenbrink criticised the major elements of China's outreach - the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, Global Civilisation Initiative and the Belt and Road Initiative - as programmes that undercut collective defence and environmental standards and sought to reframe human rights as a privilege of the West. \nPanellists at the conference said the \"Global South\" phrase was baggage-laden - a replacement for the now-discredited \"Third World\".  \nCountries concentrated in the southern hemisphere often had little in common other than some vague sense that the Global North was too dominant even as Beijing and Washington jockeyed for their loyalty - and UN votes. \n\"It doesn't mean that these countries, however resentful they may be about different aspects of Western policy, are going to drink deeply of Chinese Kool-Aid,\" Kausikan said. \nBut, he added, China \"understands the mood that constitutes the Global South better than the West and avoids what I will call sanctimonious diplomacy, insisting that its interpretation of values is the only possible interpretation\". \nChina's recent economic slowdown - fuelled by a property crisis, rising youth unemployment, battered confidence and swooning financial markets - was likely to shift Beijing's Global South emphasis, panellists said. \nSince 2015, China's spending on Belt and Road Initiative projects has been tapering off. Its slowing economy would also see it place more focus on less expensive programmes, experts said, including more training of foreign militaries, joint defence meetings, telecommunications infrastructure projects and use of the People's Liberation Army in quasi-political foreign outreach roles. \n\"Because Chinese feel more cornered in a way, with reduced options, it's going to use more diversity of tools for influence that are cheaper than just investing in big infrastructure projects,\" Nadege Rolland, a China fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research, said, adding that this would not change Beijing's focus on countering the US. \"It's not like these countries are pawns in the hands of Beijing, but Beijing certainly sees them as such and so it's a very binary vision of the rejection of the existing order.\" \nChina's adaptive tactics are particularly evident in Africa, said Paul Nantulya, an African studies research associate with the US National Defence University. \n\"The Chinese side educates more African officers than any other industrialised country. And this becomes extremely important,\" he said. \"I don't think that the Chinese government puts all its eggs in one basket.\"  \nAs the stakes and rhetoric mount between the world's two largest economies, Kritenbrink said that Washington remained focused on convincing - not arm-twisting - developing countries with revitalised alliances, financing projects and ties involving the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Summit for Democracy, US-Pacific Island Country Summit and Africa outreach programmes. \n\"We don't want countries to have to choose between us and the PRC,\" he said. \"But we want to help ensure that they have a choice and that they can make their decisions free from coercion.\"\n"

    "created_at": "2024-02-23",
    "text": "\nDane Mizuno, Staff Writer February 25, 2022\nIt has finally happened. Eight years after the invasion of Crimea, Russia has officially sent troops to the Donbas region-specifically, to the two separatist breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in southeastern Ukraine. The Russian government has acknowledged the independence of these regions, yet sent in troops under the preposterous notion of \"peacekeeping.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin attempted to justify these forceful violations of international law in a televised address: \"Ukraine is not just a neighbor. It is an inherent part of our own history, culture and spiritual space\"-a convoluted attempt to convince the world that somehow he had the moral high ground and that Russia had a right to Ukraine.\nSuch a thought inevitably draws comparisons to other international situations, namely Chinese President Xi Jinping's vow to reunite with Taiwan: \"The historical task of the complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled, and will definitely be fulfilled.\"\nBoth countries are trying to take back nations they lost during their moment of weakness: for Russia, the dissolution of the United Socialist Soviet Republic , and for China, the Chinese Communist Party's failure to suppress the democratic Republic of China, now relocated to Taiwan, in the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War.\nHowever, this is just the start of their imperial ambitions. Both states have expanding interests, with Russia aiming to expand influence over its fellow post-Soviet states and China advancing further in the Indo-Pacific region and the South China Sea. Their growing friendship is indeed concerning, as we may be at the beginning of a new combined autocratic sphere of influence.\nDuring this past Winter Olympics, the two autocratic leaders seem to have formalized their relations on the international stage, with both meeting and taking aim at the United States and its allies. They both promised that they would \"counter interference by outside forces in the internal affairs of sovereign countries under any pretext\"-warning the U.S. to refrain from interfering in Ukraine and Taiwan.\nWith a friendly relationship between Russia and China becoming more conspicuous, the U.S. and its allies must focus on preventing their catastrophic intentions. Diverting attention to just one would present a major fatal flaw in international affairs. After all, the U.S. has made this mistake before. Back when the USSR was at the height of its power, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong had a fallout, showing cracks in the relations between the two communist regimes. The U.S. sought to exploit that by coddling China so that China would provide a means to contain the USSR. Domestically, the U.S. granted China \"most favored nation\" status for years, allowing China to gain access to U.S markets, while globally, the U.S. permitted China's admittance to the World Trade Organization. This allowed for Chinese businesses and products to expand rapidly via global markets. At the created_at, Chinese companies copied U.S. technology in areas including, but not limited to, aerospace and consumer electronics. However, the U.S. was more focused on the USSR, so it did not care to have barriers to its proprietary technology with China or to disrupt their relationship until it was too late.\nOne can argue that China would have found other ways to rise to its current status as a global economic superpower. But back then, the U.S. provided most of the world's sophisticated technology-any sanctions could have slowed China's economic growth. As a consequence of the U.S.'s failure to handle more than one threat at a created_at, China is now a serious contender with the U.S. in various sectors, such as military power and advanced technologies. If we do not learn from our past mistakes of focusing only on one threat, how are we supposed to redeem ourselves in the future?\nUnfortunately, former President Obama's main foreign policy initiative was to disregard Russia and to focus mainly on combating China through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and former President Trump furthered this through his use of tariffs and through his pro-Russia rhetoric. President Biden is not doing so well in foreign policy either. The withdrawal of U.S. forces and its European allies from Afghanistan last year left a power vacuum for Moscow and Beijing to exploit, allowing both to further expand their influence in the Middle East. Moreover, the fact that both Russia and China see the U.S. and its allies as threats means that Afghanistan emboldened both of these countries-they saw the U.S. withdrawal as a sign of weakness and of decline in the U.S.'s unipolarity in the world.\nEconomically, both happen to mutually complement each other, with Russia providing oil and gas to an energy-starved China and China providing advanced technology to an uninnovative Russia.\nTheir shared skepticism of the West's future and their complementary economies will be the drive that pushes them to a coalition of powers that will oppose Washington. The utmost foreign policy priority of the U.S. and its allies should be to sever this increasingly close relationship. Otherwise, the consequences could be disastrous.\nMizuno's Mind\n"

    "created_at": "2024-02-23",
    "text": "\nFebruary 23rd, 2024 ( Deutsche Welle World  — Delivered by  Newstex )\nPhilippines' President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has managed to improve his country's relations with the West despite questions surrounding his rule.Since taking office in mid-2022, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has moved the Philippines closer to the US, even risking ire from Beijing by signing a new defense agreement with Washington.Marcos Jr. also pushed to normalize ties with the EU that had been badly damaged by his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, whose brutal war on drugs prompted criticism from Europe.Duterte responded with expletive-laden tirades, telling European leaders to stay out of his country's affairs and threatening to expel all European ambassadors.But in 2023, Ursula von der Leyen became the first sitting European Commission president to visit the Philippines, where she spoke of a new era of cooperation between us.Marcos Jr. is now set to visit Germany next month and Brussels in December this year.Brussels and Manila have also agreed to restart talks over a free trade agreements which had broken down in 2015 under Duterte.Marcos Jr. pick for his foreign secretary, Enrique Manalo, can also be seen as a signal to the EU - Manalo had previously served as an ambassador to several European states and as head of the Philippine Mission in Brussels.But analysts say the changes between the Philippines and the EU are driven by deeper geopolitical factors.The Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 was a major catalyst, according to Joshua Espena, a resident fellow at International Development and Security Cooperation, a Manila-based think tank.Espena said Europe needed to strengthen its global supply chains and has attempted to tap into the Indo-Pacific region.First South Asian leader to choose between US and ChinaWhereas Duterte has attempted to forge closer relations between the Philippines and China, with varying degrees of success, Marcos Jr. entered office with a resolutely pro-Western stance.Tensions between Manila and Beijing, especially over the territory they contest in the South China Sea, has also massively escalated over the past 12 months.The EU and the Philippines announced a new maricreated_at defense agreement last year.In October, the EU and the Philippines signed the €60 million Financing Agreement for the Green Economy Programme, a result of the Marcos Jr administration's focus on climate action.Marcos Jr. can be considered Europe's 'best friend' in Southeast Asia, said Alfred Gerstl, an expert on Indo-Pacific international relations at the University of Vienna.Marcos Jr. has canceled some prominent infrastructure projects part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, and the EU's Global Gateway Initiative, a EU-led global investment scheme, could fill some of the void, said Gerstl.Writing about US-Philippines relations last month, the Council on Foreign Relations analyst Joshua Kurlantzick argued that Marcos Jr. has moved Manila into the US camp more than any other Southeast Asian leader, seemingly becoming the first Southeast Asian leader to 'choose' between the United States and China.Concerns over constitutionSome of the analysts DW spoke to said it was simply good timing that Marcos Jr. entered office and gave every appearance of being a more democratic, liberal and like-minded politician at a created_at when European leaders were desperate, because of the Ukraine war, to find new partners.But many doubt that Manila has actually changed in terms of democracy and human rights.Marcos Jr. will be someone the EU can work with for as long as the EU does not look too closely enough to see that the looming change in the Philippine Constitution is likely to result in an even weaker democracy than before, said Sol Dorotea Iglesias, assistant professor of Political Science at the University of the Philippines.Some critics say that Marcos Jr. could change the constitution to make it easier for foreign investors to purchase or create companies in certain industries.This might also give him a chance to remove provisions that limit a president's power.Marcos Jr. has rejected this possibility.What if ICC goes after Duterte?Another issue could arise over the International Criminal Court's ongoing investigations into former president Duterte for crimes against humanity.If the Marcos Jr. government refuses to cooperate, the EU may be forced to finally take more drastic measures such as suspending the trade privileges of the Philippines, Iglesias said.Among the EU institutions, the European Parliament has often had a sharper eye on such risks and may continue to play the role of watchdog as this drama unfolds, she added.On the other hand, European leaders are likely to be willing to overlook any lingering concerns about human rights in the Philippines because they see Marcos Jr. personally as a reliable partner, said a European Commission official who requested anonymity.EU looking for Asian alliesThe official added that Brussels is keen to view Marcos Jr. in the best of lights since it is distrustful of many other Southeast Asian leaders.Relations with Muslim-majority Malaysia have soured over European support for Israel during its war with Hamas and because of Brussels environmental regulations, the source noted.Thailand's new coalition government is unstable.Vietnam remains a key partner in the region but relations with its communist government are irregular, while Cambodia remains in the EU's bad books for its democratic regression.Brussels is still cautious with Prabowo Subianto, who is likely to become Indonesia's next president after an election earlier this month.Prabowo took a particularly hostile stance towards the EU over high-tension disputes regarding how EU environmental regulations will impact Indonesia's palm oil sector.According to Espena, the EU and the Philippines have every reason to want to keep improving relations.Friendships do not need to be okay all of the created_at and while personal relations are important, deep-seated interests based on the structural conditions of the world matter more, he said.Edited by: Darko Janjevic\nLink to the original story.N"

It’s a concern for every country … who would be the next president ... everytext is preparing for that,” Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez told Reuters in a video interview.\nBiden is likely to face Donald Trump, the Republican front runner, to be the party’s presidential candidate, in a rematch in November’s presidential election.\n“Any change is always something that we welcome,” Romualdez added.\n“It gives us an opportunity to renew what we’ve already been saying, that our relationship with the US is an important one, we value it, and we really hope that this is the same feeling that they have for us.”\nUnder Marcos, the Philippines nearly doubled the number of its bases accessible to US forces, including three new sites facing Taiwan, as it shifts its focus to territorial defence.\nMilitary exercises have taken place regularly for decades, but manoeuvres have extended lately to include joint air and sea patrols over the South China Sea and close to Taiwan, actions China has seen as provocations and “stirring up trouble”.\nBeijing’s ties with Manila have soured amid repeated spats over disputed features in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, during which China’s coastguard has used water cannons to drive away Philippine vessels, disrupting fishing and resupply missions to troops in what Beijing sees as its territory.\nThe Philippines’ western allies and “like-minded” partners see China’s “aggressive behaviour as totally unacceptable,” said Romualdez, a cousin of the Philippine president.\nHe said it would not waiver in its commitment to defend its sovereignty and sovereign rights in the South China Sea and “will not back down” over the Second Thomas Shoal, a submerged reef on which the Philippines grounded an old warship in 1999 to serve as a military outpost.\nDespite other global challenges, the US remains “committed to our mutual defence treaty, committed to our alliance,” Romualdez said.\nThat 1951 treaty binds both countries to defend each other in the event of attack and Marcos last year succeeded in pushing Washington to make clear the extent of that security commitment.\nRomualdez also said the relationship was expanding in economic areas too, with the US due to send its first presidential trade mission to the Philippines next month, for which there was “very, very strong” interest from American companies.  |  Reuters\n"

    "text": "\nSri Lanka, Feb. 24 -- Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr has pledged to take legal action against Beijing once it is proven that Chinese boats had used cyanide to \"intentionally destroy\" the fish-rich Scarborough Shoal in the disputed South China Sea.\nCiting reports from Filipino fishermen, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) last week said Chinese and Vietnamese trawlers have been using the toxic substance in the shoal, locally known as Bajo de Masinloc.\nChina has controlled the atoll since 2012 and deployed a flotilla of fishing boats to the area ever since.\n\"If we feel that there is enough ground to do so, we will [pursue charges],\" Marcos said, adding that cyanide use in Philippine waters was not uncommon.\n\"I do know that there are cases of cyanide fishing, even before, here in the Philippines. But I think the reason that it has been more alarming is that it has become more prevalent,\" he said.\nJonathan Malaya, a spokesman of the National Security Council, said BFAR would work on gathering more evidence to back its claim, which China dismissed as \"sheer fabrication\".\n\"The Chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of ecological environment and conservation of fishing resources and resolutely fights against fishing activities that violate laws and regulations,\" its foreign ministry said.\nBFAR spokesperson Nazario Briguera accused the Chinese fishermen of using cyanide to \"intentionally destroy Bajo de Masinloc to prevent Filipino fishing boats from fishing in the area\".\nMalaya said BFAR's findings, if substantiated, could be sent to the Department of Justice and the Office of the Solicitor General for building a case on environmental destruction before an appropriate international tribunal.\n\"The challenge here is to prove the responsibility for the coral degradation and the impact to the environment is coming from these specific people,\" he said.\nSolicitor General Menardo Guevarra agreed with Malaya, saying \"any legal action must be supported by strong, solid and competent evidence that can withstand the scrutiny of any international tribunal\".\nCyanide fishing involves the sprinkling of the deadly chemical compound near coral reefs to stun fish so they can be easily caught.\nFisherfolk group Pamalakaya criticised BFAR for \"failing\" to rein in the controversial fishing practice, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported.\n\"Despite the evident poaching and other destructive fishing activities of foreign fishing vessels in the country's territorial waters, the BFAR continues to fail to implement its own fishing laws to protect the marine resources and Filipino fisherfolk,\" it said.\nScarborough Shoal has long been a key source of tension between the Philippines and China.\nChina's coastguard drove away a BFAR vessel that it said \"illegally intruded\" into the waters adjacent to the shoal, state media reported on Thursday.\nBut a Philippine coastguard spokesman dismissed that claim.\n\"This statement is inaccurate. The BFAR vessel, BRP Datu Sanday, continues to patrol the waters of Bajo De Masinloc. Currently, the BFAR vessel is actively ensuring the security of Filipino fishermen in that area,\" Commodore Jay Tarriela said on Thursday.\nLast year, the Philippine coastguard removed a 300-metre-long barrier installed by China at the entrance to the strategic outcrop, which Manila says lies within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), a 370km stretch of water where coastal states have exclusive rights to fish and other resources.\nBeijing claims sovereignty over almost the entirety of the South China Sea - where the Philippines and several other nations have competing claims - and has rejected a 2016 international ruling that ruled in favour of Manila and found China's assertions have no legal basis.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

    "text": "\nAdversaries have multiple options in informal wars and a proactive defence and a strong deterrence is needed to dissuade adversaries, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan said Friday. He also highlighted the need for a multi-agency, transnational, and inter-disciplinary effort to fight information warfare.\nGen Chauhan was speaking at a panel discussion on the last day of the Raisina Dialogue 2024 on The New Wars: Policies, Practices, and Preparation. He said in informal wars, the enemy has more options than the defender. He said conventional defence is finite in terms of created_at and space even as offence is not that finite.\nHe said non-traditional threats cut across multiple domains and affect the military as well as intelligence agencies and people involved in the national security architecture, adding that multi-agency coordination within the government should be able to perceive these kinds of threats. Gen Chauhan said coordination between friends and partners to keep a track of emerging threats is imperative given that informal warfare often cuts across boundaries.\nSpeaking on grey-zone warfare, he said it requires several approaches in the backdrop of its origins lying in a historical dispute, adding that grey-zone warfare is the latest in informal warfare. He said grey-zone warfare involves the use of unconventional military action below the threshold of traditional warfare but does invite action.\nHe said the current situation in the South China Sea and on the northern borders can be an example of the use of grey-zone warfare. He said there is a difference between how the West and the East see wars. He said while the West believes in direct military action, the East follows created_atly military action.\n  The Indian Express (P) Ltd                                                                                    \n"

    "text": "\n More than the skirmishes happening above water in the West Philippine Sea, the destruction of corals and marine ecosystems underneath is the bigger crime that should concern countries in territorial disputes over the South China Sea (SCS).\nFor many years now, amid China's aggressive occupation and island-building on parts of the West Philippine Sea, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and Filipino fishermen have observed and reported the destruction of corals, and the illegal and destructive harvesting of giant clams and other marine resources in the vast area within the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ).But last weekend's report by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) is deeply concerning. According to BFAR spokesperson Nazario Briguera, Chinese fishermen have been using cyanide to willfully destroy the marine resources in Scarborough Shoal, also known as Bajo de Masinloc off Zambales, a traditional fishing ground for Filipino fishermen.\nGrave accusations\nThe destruction of Bajo de Masinloc was meant 'to prevent Filipino fishing boats [from fishing] in the area,'' Briguera said, quoting accounts by fishermen that, he added, have yet to be validated by the government. In response, President Marcos said: 'If we feel that there is enough ground to do so, we will [pursue charges].'Indeed, such grave accusations must be backed by evidence. 'Any legal action must be supported by strong, solid, and competent evidence that can withstand the scrutiny of any international tribunal,'' Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra said.The Chinese Embassy has dismissed the BFAR spokesperson's claim as 'totally baseless and sheer fabrication,' adding that the Chinese government 'attaches great importance to the protection of ecological environment and [the] conservation of fishery resources.'\nDevastating impact\nIt's a tall order to prove China's use of cyanide in the area, given that the PCG and the military already have their hands full coping with provocation by Chinese ships using water cannons and dangerous maneuvers against our fishermen and resupply missions, as well as monitoring the Chinese militia and fishing fleets that habitually swarm our EEZ.\nThe government should pursue its plan to document the environmental damage brought about by China's activities in the West Philippine Sea, and bring the issue before international bodies willing to take up this alarming infraction that has a wide-ranging global impact.\nPart of that documentation are the reports prepared by private think tanks, including the Asia Maricreated_at Transparency Initiative (Amti) project of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nAn Amti report released last year found that activities of claimant countries in the SCS have had devastating impact, with vast areas of coral reefs destroyed and fish stocks depleted. 'In recent decades, increased fishing, dredging, and landfill, along with giant clam harvesting, have taken a devastating toll on thousands of species found nowhere else on earth,' the report noted.\nGiant clam harvesting\nWhile other countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and even the Philippines were cited for causing some of the damage, the report said China was responsible for the most extensive reef destruction through dredging and landfill. Of some 6,200 acres (9.65 square miles) of coral reefs destroyed by island-building, 75 percent was due to China's activities. Another 16,353 acres or 25.55 square miles of reef were damaged by giant clam harvesting by Chinese fishermen who drag 'specially made brass propellers' underwater, causing widespread damage to the reef.\nIn March 2019, the late former foreign secretary Albert del Rosario and former ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales filed a communication before the International Criminal Court (ICC) against Chinese President Xi Jinping for the environmental destruction caused by China's occupation and island-building within the Philippine EEZ.The two noted how these activities 'involve massive, near permanent, and devastating environmental damage across nations' and undermine the food and energy security of coastal countries in the SCS. The ICC, however, dismissed the communication for lack of jurisdiction since China is not an ICC member.\nEnvironmental suit\nDel Rosario pointed out that the damage to the environment and the livelihood of fishermen had been properly documented and submitted to the international tribunal, which in 2016 nullified China's sweeping claims over the SCS.\nRather than being on the defensive, it is created_at for the Philippines to take the lead in making China accountable for the destruction of the marine resources in our 370-kilometer EEZ and the wider regional waters. Be it by showing ghastly videos of destroyed coral reefs or Chinese fishermen hauling giant clams on their boats, or actually filing an environmental suit against its giant neighbor, the Philippines will be fighting a good fight worthy of support from other nations. And who knows, we just might repeat our historic victory in 2016.\n"

    "created_at": "2024-02-25",
    "text": "\nFact Four: The Philippines has failed to control illegal fishing, and its authorities and politicians have turned a blind eye to it out of economic interests.\nThe Philippines has banned cyanide fishing, yet it still happens on a large scale. Enforcement isn't strong enough. Rafols has revealed that the police and military officers in Philippines who are supposed to prevent dynamite and cyanide use are directly involved in it.\nThe fore-mentioned academic paper found that aside from national laws and regulations, municipal ordinances throughout the country also exist. However, in most cities, these ordinances are not being implemented or are weakly enforced.\nFact Five: The US and Europe are the main markets for the precious fish caught using cyanide in the Philippines. \nUnknown to many of the millions of Americans who enjoy home aquariums, most of the tropical fish they buy are heavily laced with cyanide.\nSince the 1970s, corporations in Manila that provide the majority of fish to American and European markets have found that by using industrial sodium cyanide in offshore ocean reefs, they can bring thousands of fish to the surface and increase their profits.\nUp to 90 percent of the 11 million tropical fish that enter the US each year are caught illegally with cyanide, according to a 2008 report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThis willful ignorance and persistent trade are the ultimate drivers of the ongoing destruction of the global marine environment caused by cyanide fishing.\n\"The weak control of illegal trade by Europe and the US has led to so many people to engage in this illegal fishing for their livelihoods in Philippine. The US and Europe are the forces behind such illegal fishing,\" Yang Xiao, deputy director of the Institute of Maricreated_at Strategy Studies, China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global created_ats.\nFact Six: In recent years, the Philippines has repeatedly hyped up cyanide fishing cases against neighboring countries while remaining silent on its own lack of control. \nThe Philippines has targeted neighboring countries including Vietnam and China in promoting cases of cyanide fishing and arresting their fishermen, which experts said is a typical case of \"accusing others of one's own faults.\" \nThe Philippines' fishing bureau spokesperson has accused Chinese fishing vessels of using cyanide to destroy Huangyan Dao recently. The bureau said it hadn't conducted a formal study of the total damage but said it was a \"serious concern.\"\nBut the Philippine coast guard on February 18 said it hadn't found any evidence of Chinese fishermen using cyanide and couldn't confirm the fisheries bureau's accusation in an interview with GMA News.\n\"The Philippine government first raised this accusation, which was then quickly clarified and denied by the country's coast guard, in an attempt to cool things down. This inconsistency exposes the true nature of the Philippines' false propaganda in this 'cognitive war',\" Yang believes.\nFact Seven: The Philippine authorities have acknowledged that the hype surrounding cyanide fishing is serving their planned \"second arbitration\" against China, revealing the role of this cognitive warfare.\nPhilippine authorities have recently stated that it will build up a case against Chinese fishermen if the government finds legal basis on their alleged use of cyanide to damage the Huangyan Dao.\n\"It is obvious that the Philippines is hyping up the so-called illegal fishing by China at this created_at, only to gather evidence for its planned lawsuit and compensation claim. This is believed to be one of the tricks behind Manila's seeking of legal options against China over its alleged destruction of coral reefs within the Philippines' 'exclusive economic zone (EEZ).' This clearly shows that the Philippines' long-planned so-called South China Sea environmental lawsuit is a drama full of scheming, fabricating charges, and creating lies,\" Yang told the Global created_ats.\n\"If certain Filipino politicians truly care about the development and prosperity of the South China Sea, the livelihood and health of coastal residents, and the coral, fish, shrimp, turtles, and seaweed in the South China Sea, China's advanced marine environmental protection practices and governance experience can serve as a model for the Philippines to learn from and as a source of assistance,\" the expert said.\n"

The incident happened 1.2 nautical miles south of Panatag Shoal, also called Bajo de Masinloc.\nDespite the challenge, the BFAR and the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) were able to deliver supplies, including gasoline and grocery packs, to the Filipino fishermen onboard 44 mother ships in Panatag Shoal, the state-run television network added.\nMeanwhile, a group supposedly based in China once again accused the Philippines of provocation due to the presence of Filipino fishing boats around the Panatag Shoal.\nIn a post on X yesterday, the South China Sea Probing Initiative posted photos that it said were of Philippine fishing boats scattered around Panatag Shoal last Feb. 22.\nOne photo showed the boats seemingly forming a line, while another showed the boats already dispersed.\n'Obviously, this is an organized provocative behavior and has nothing to do with the livelihood of fishermen,' the group claimed.\nThe Filipino vessels were also 'just aiming to challenge the status quo of Chinese control,' it added.\nThe South China Sea Probing Initiative - with officials composed mostly of Chinese academicians - was established in April 2019 or three years after the 2016 arbitral award, 'with a view to maintaining and promoting the peace, stability and prosperity of the South China Sea,' according to information on its website\n'The Initiative aims to integrate intellectual resources and open source information worldwide and keep track of important actions and major policy changes of key stakeholders and other parties involved. It provides professional data services and analysis reports to parties concerned, helping them keep competition under control and with a view to seek partnerships,' it added.\nPCG Commodore Jay Tarriela, who speaks for West Philippine Sea concerns, slammed the claim by the group, asserting Filipino fishing boats were not being used for any hostile or provocative operation.\nHe maintained the Filipino fishing boats were 'waiting in line to receive fuel subsidies from the (BRP Datu Sanday),' he wrote on his X account in response to the group's post.\n'We are not like China that uses fishing vessels as part of its gray zone tactics to alter the status quo in the West Philippine Sea. Filipino fishermen have been fishing in these waters for generations, long before the establishment of the Chinese Coast Guard,' he pointed out.\nTarriela added the Philippines has 'no reason for us to justify our presence there because the Philippines has sovereignty over (Bajo de Masinloc) and its territorial sea, and sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the surrounding waters falling within our EEZ as measured from the our archipelagic baselines in accordance with UNCLOS' or the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nMeanwhile, the coast guard of the United Kingdom has expressed support for its Philippine counterpart, particularly in protecting the Indo-Pacific region.\nThe assurance was relayed by officers of HMS Spey, a batch 2 River-class offshore patrol vessel, docked at the Port of Manila until today.\nPCG chief Rear Admiral Hostillo Arturo Cornelio welcomed HMS Spey's commanding officer Commander Paul Caddy at the PCG national headquarters last Feb. 23, it added.\nThe return of the HMS Spey 'served as an official defense engagement and outreach to build relationships forged through exercise and to reassure the Philippines of the United Kingdom's maricreated_at presence under our Indo-Pacific strategy,' the PCG said.\nIt added the said vessel joined the exercise SAMA-SAMA with the United States Navy and the Philippine Navy. The exercise 'strengthened the country's international defense cooperation and advance a rules-based international order\n"

    "created_at": "2024-02-25",
    "text": "\nThese days, Australian foreign and security policy seems as much driven by politics as it is by the national interest. The Albanese government's initial enthusiasm for active diplomacy in the South Pacific was laudable. The incursion of China into the region's security environment and the recent riots in Papua New Guinea are a stark reminder that Australia needs to be constantly engaged with the region.\nIt has also made sense for the government to have embraced the change of diplomatic tactics by China. Its bullying of Australia as part of its aggressive wolf warrior diplomatic foray proved a disaster. Not only did Australia refuse to be cowed by China, but China's diplomatic and even military aggression led to the consolidation of the Quad and the development of initiatives such as AUKUS.\nLink to Image\nLouie Douvis\nChina's aggression has also alarmed India and worried Indonesia. And remember, these two countries were founder members of the Non-Aligned Movement. The Indians think the Non-Aligned Movement is now dead, and the incoming Indonesian president told officials in London two years ago - when he was the defence minister - that China was the greatest single threat to Indonesia's security.\nChinese diplomats obviously know that wolf warrior diplomacy was a disaster, and they've now toned down their aggression. That's led to a desire by China to reconcile with Australia. The government has been right to accept the offer to re-establish a civilised relationship.\nThe present Labor government has also put aside two absurd features of the Keating era: a defence policy designed solely to deal with direct invasion of Australia and the diminution of Australia's traditional alliances, particularly with the United States. We were reminded of these quaint ideas last week when Paul Keating did an 80th birthday interview with this paper's editor-in-chief.\nTo be fair, there was some good stuff in the interview. Keating is right about our excessive dependence on income taxes, he was right to tell the prime minister not to try to enshrine the Voice in the constitution - I told the prime minister the same thing - and he's right that presumptive Indonesian president Prabowo Subianto is likely to be sympathetic to a strategic relationship with Australia. That strategic relationship is underpinned by the 2006 Lombok Treaty, a treaty which over created_at will be recognised as one of the two or three most important Australia has ever negotiated. It certainly puts in the shade the tacky piece of paper Keating signed with an ailing dictator which lasted just one year after Suharto's demise.\nBut I've never thought Keating really understood the Indo-Pacific region. After all, he came to focus on it after he became prime minister with all the zeal of a convert. While Keating has always had a clear understanding of power within Australia, he's never seemed to grasp international power politics. His, and Labor's, traditional approach to defence strategy is the defence of Australia. Of course but what they fail to understand is that Australia's security will only be threatened if regional order and security breaks down.\nSouth China Sea risks\nThis is a region which will successfully navigate the rise of China if there is a regional balance of power. That doesn't mean pursuing a policy of containment of China. We need to coexist with China. But the region needs the continuing engagement of the United States underpinned by its key allies - Japan, Australia and South Korea - if growing Chinese power is to be balanced. And notice how the Philippines has re-activated its alliance with the US.\nWith a regional power balance, adventurism by China will be discouraged. China knows that for US President Joe Biden an invasion of Taiwan would be a casus belli. Equally, China knows that its attempt to control just about all the South China Sea is just not acceptable to the region as a whole and is meeting determined resistance. But without America's presence and its network of alliances and partnerships, China would just take what it wanted. Taiwan would be swiftly swallowed up into the People's Republic of China and the whole of the South China Sea would become a Chinese lake with the littoral states paying tribute to Beijing. That's not a pretty picture, and it would be disconcerting to say the least for Australia.\nThe thing about alliances is that all members of an alliance need to contribute to it. It's not good enough for Australia to proclaim it has an alliance with the United States, but it is only an a la carte alliance: it's up to America to defend us, but we'll make a minimal contribution to that alliance. That's what the Europeans have done. The taxpayers of Boise, Idaho, fund the deterrence capability of Europe but taxpayers in Dusseldorf don't bother. That's led to the admittedly excessive Donald Trump rhetoric about defending Europe.\nSerious and lethal capabilities\nIn this region, we need to be making a significant contribution to the regional power balance and the alliance. That means having serious and lethal defence capabilities. Just having a navy which might stop incursions into Australian territory is not enough. We need to have a defence force which can not only deter attacks on Australia but can also operate effectively throughout our region, and occasionally where necessary beyond.\nThat's the great advantage of AUKUS. Buying nuclear submarines from the Americans and working with them and the British to design the next generation of nuclear submarines makes perfect sense. Building them in Adelaide at a total cost of $360 billion? Nope, that's never going to happen. As with the government's plan to acquire 11 general purpose frigates off the shelf, we should buy our submarines off the shelf. It will be much cheaper and much quicker.\nThey'd be well advised to listen to him on economic policy but ignore him on foreign policy.\nSo, back to the government and the politics of foreign and security policy. Labor has done well in the Pacific, has been right to re-engage with China and is right to focus on building up the navy and commit to AUKUS. But one day someone will have to tell us how this naval expansion will be funded. It will cost a lot more than the $11 billion so far flagged by the defence minister. Add to that the $350 billion AUKUS submarine commitment and these announcements sound as though they're designed for domestic politics not the real world of defence policy.\nAnd as for Labor's statements on the Middle East, they're solely driven by trying to stop the leakage of Labor votes to the Greens in heavily Islamic electorates.\nBut whatever you think of Labor's foreign and security policies, at least they've kept well away from Paul Keating's advice. They'd be well advised to listen to him on economic policy but ignore him on foreign policy.\n\nGraphic\n \nPaul Keating at 80: He never really understood the Indo-Pacific region.\n"

    "created_at": "2024-02-25",
    "text": "\nMy name is Brent Sadler. I am the Senior Research Fellow at The Heritage Foundation covering maricreated_at and naval issues and advanced technology. The views I express in this testimony are my own and should not be construed as representing any official position of The Heritage Foundation.\nCourse Correction Required to Wage the New Cold War\nToday we are nearly four years from the warning the Indo-Pacific Commander, Admiral Philip Davidson, gave that the Chinese Communist Party was preparing for a war with the U.S. by 2027. n1 Since then, little meaningful progress has been achieved to alter the military balance to deter China's leaders from acting on that goal - defeat the U.S. and subjugate Taiwan. n2 The urgency for real action cannot be understated, as created_at goes by there are fewer options available while the cost for real deterrence grows. Failing to act, however, would result in the most destructive and consequential war this nation has had fight.\nAn Increasingly Dangerous World for America\nAs Americans go about their daily lives unmolested, for now, the world is accelerating in its change - much of it perilous to our national survival. The past four years has seen Iran and its proxies engage our Navy in the Red Sea, attack our armed forces across the Middle East without real consequence, and of course the coordinated barbaric assault on Israel on October 7th 2023. The war between Russia and Ukraine broke out and settled into an unsustainable attritional contest due to a series of miscalculations and dithering by D.C. n3 Finally, and most dangerously, on the back of a decades long sustained military buildup, China's military is increasingly confident and willing to directly challenge the U.S. Just last summer a scuffle between Chinese maricreated_at forces and the Philippines at Second Thomas shoal resulted in serious injury - significantly such violence could trigger a U.S. response as the Philippines is a treaty ally. n4 While the Biden administration did send its diplomats and senior military leaders to the region often, words alone have not deterred China from its current path to confrontation. As such, the trajectory we are on in the world is both unsustainable and increasingly dangerous. n5 This did not have to be the case.\nFor the last four years, instead of bolstering our military and backing up proactive diplomacy with meaningful consequences to our enemies, the nation is confronted by two wars and a simmering conflict in Asia. The trigger for this dates to the ill executed 2021 evacuation from Afghanistan. This event along with confused diplomacy and no meaningful military posture adjustments effectively gave Russia a green light for invasion in February 2022 against Ukraine. While the U.S. and its allies rallied support once Ukraine had stymied the initial Russian onslaught, the over cautious and tardy delivery of weapons meant that the war predictably settled into a contest of attrition that favored Russia. The military support for this preventable war drew munitions intended for Taiwan and Israel -notable was the moving of guided munitions and artillery rounds from Israel in the months before Hamas' October 7th assault. n6 The U.S. Navy has conducted naval combat operations on a scale and veracity not seen since World War Two as Iran's proxy the Houthis attempted to severe shipping and attack Israel's supporters. n7 This has seen significant depletion of expensive and hard to replace air and missile defense weapons -like the standard missile three (SM-3 $9m - $28m). China is watching and calculating, but so far has not acted, there are several reasons for this.\nFirst, the unity of NATO and increasing defense expenditures for weapons and militaries that are interoperable amongst allies familiar with each others' operations. This was not in China's Xi Jinping's nor Russia's Vladimir Putin's calculations for how a divided NATO on the eve of the February invasion of Ukraine would play out. n8 That unity paired with sustained increased defense spending presents a potential united front that China has to contend. This, however, remains tenuous and could easily recde.\nSecond, despite all the chaos of the last several years, the U.S. Navy has managed to sustain significant presence in the western Pacific. n9 This comes at a cost in added wear on the ships and sailors reliant on a logistics infrastructure of ports, support ships, and dry docks too few to assure contested forward naval operations. n10 Case in point, the grounding of Navy tanker USNS Big Horn in September 2024 jeopardized ongoing Red Sea combat operations by the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group. n11 That said, actions by allies Japan and Philippines in welcoming greater U.S. military presence somewhat offsets risks - such as the U.S.-Philippines Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites where USMC and Army forces have been increasingly calling with the 2022 election of Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos. n12\nThird, though inconsistent, the strong messages of support to Taiwan in the past few years clearly has caused China unease but uncertainty too as to how rapid and significant U.S. support would be to the island. n13 Troublingly, at the same created_at, China has used U.S. political support for Taiwan to rationalize a significant and sustained military presence that could easily mask an attack against the island as the current Commander of Indo-Pacific Command has recently asserted. n14 The decision by the U.S. to intervene in a war over Taiwan is a function of the context of how that war starts, but It is after all where over 80,000 Americans (or more) live, work or travel on any given day. n15 As such, in that war of choice by China, it knows those Americans would likely be casualties that would incite a vigorous American response - to say nothing of the economic damage caused to everyday Americans here at home - making an American military response to a Chinese assault on Taiwan highly likely. n16\nFinally, and perhaps most shocking, is China's nuclear arsenal breakout. In 2021, satellite imagery uncovered three new fields of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos being constructed in the Gobi desert - by mid-2024 quadrupling their ICBM arsenal to 400 missiles. n17 Then in October 2021, it was reported China had tested a fractional orbital bombardment system that greatly complicates our missile defenses with its unlimited range and vectors of attack. n18 The U.S. response has been lackluster in recapitalizing its nuclear deterrent forces: Columbia class ballistic missile submarines are behind schedule and have too few missile tubes to meet the threat. n19 And, gaps in the U.S. nuclear escalation ladder have been dangerously evident at created_ats in the Ukraine war with Russia's threat to use tactical nuclear weapons and no comparable U.S. response option. n20\nRestoring Deterrence with China\nThe challenge facing the nation today is how to restore an ebbing deterrence and prevent a war in Asia while not ceding our democratic way of life and prosperity for our children. This will require several urgent actions:\nOne, bring the war in Ukraine to a conclusion while NATO restores its military capacities to enforce a sustained peace in Europe. This will allow U.S. munition production and military presence to be focused in the western Pacific.\nTwo, support Israel and our middle east allies in rolling back and severing Iran's network of terrorist proxies. The goal being to prevent a repeat of October 7th barbaric attacks, and pressure the regime in Iran to focus internally rather than exporting its terrorism. This mitigates the potential for a crisis that draws U.S. forces needed in the Pacific to deter China.\nThree, operate our military differently and in ways that complement diplomatic and economic statecraft. This will engender a rethinking of how American statecraft is executed - a retooling of our institutions to wage a new Cold War. n21 The nation has done this before, as the Cold War with the Soviet Union was unfolding, Congress passed the National Security Act of 1947; establishing the CIA and beginning a process of making our military services more unified or joint. Given the nature of the Chinese threat globally and specifically against Taiwan militarily, naval statecraft is the best way forward - a maricreated_at strategic framework for using American power.\nFour, commit to restoring the nation's maricreated_at industrial base vital to building and sustaining a Navy able to deter, fight and win in a conflict with China. n22 This will require committing significant resources akin to the build up seen in the 1930s as the world edged to conflagration - a modern Naval Act is one way to accomplish this. n23 And already, there is wide support for efforts to restore our maricreated_at industry with the SHIPS for America Act; a promising first step to regaining the ability to sustaining a warcreated_at economy in a prolonged war with China. n24\nAmerica First National Security Rising\nAs we enter the second month of the America First era under President Trump, it is increasingly clear that there is a groundswell for action and appreciation of the dangers we as a nation we are in. Looking ahead, the early choices made by this administration give some insight as to what is in store:\nEarly engagement with Russia and Ukraine to end the war. This has invigorated our European allies to huddle and finally commit real money in their own defense as well as explore ways of supporting Ukraine's future security. n25 In 2014, only the U.S., United Kingdom and Greece met the agreed 2% of GDP spent on defense, by 2023 that number has grown to include 11 NATO members. n26 This is positive and long past due. That said, the devil will be in the details as to how long this peace is sustained and what U.S. defense resources can be moved to Asia.\nSupport for Israel and recommitment to progressing the successful Abraham Accords. Relations soured by President Biden with Saudi Arabia, appear to shifting to a positive trajectory with high level engagements in Riyadh last week. n27 This as promises by the White House to restore maximum sanctions on the regime in Tehran that could see the needed rollback of Iran's proxies and its destabilizing efforts. n28 Uncertainty remains as to what new will be done to end the Houthi's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.\nClear focus on regaining our nation's industrial strength with often stated focus on shipbuilding, shipping and the Navy. It was notable that the second defense department nominee announced after the Secretary of Defense was the Secretary of the Navy. However, progress will be slowed until the rest of the maricreated_at team at the Department of the Navy and Maricreated_at Administration is put in place.

    "text": "\n The recent revelations by American analysts from a Washington-based think tank regarding China's alleged destruction of coral reefs in the South China Sea (SCS) are deeply concerning. According to satellite data and accounts from fishermen and the Philippine Coast Guard, China has reportedly destroyed around 243 square kilometers of coral reefs, equivalent to the size of Manila, Valenzuela, and Quezon cities combined. This extensive damage not only poses a threat to the marine ecosystem but also affects the seafood diet of people in Southeast Asia. (Read the BusinessMirror story: 'US think tank says China destroyed, damaged 243 square kilometers of coral reefs in SCS,' February 24, 2024).\nChina's method of creating artificial islands by burying coral reefs with sediment and landfill is not only detrimental to the environment but also undermines the ability of reefs to repair themselves over created_at. While this strategy may have bolstered China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, it has come at a significant cost to the fragile ecosystem. Monica Sato, a researcher from the Center for Strategic Studies-Asian Maricreated_at Transparency Institute (CMS-AMTI), points out that this form of artificial island building is considered the most destructive to the environment due to the removal of essential reef substructures.\nWhile China bears the greatest responsibility for the destruction, Vietnam has also contributed to the damage through similar dredging activities. The wanton harvesting of giant clams, popular in China for their value as jewelry and house ornaments, further exacerbates the destruction of coral reefs. The environmental consequences of these actions are severe, with recovery potentially taking decades or even centuries.\nThe implications of this extensive environmental damage extend beyond the immediate destruction of coral reefs. The total catch of fish in the South China Sea has remained stagnant since the 1990s, leading to a decline in fish populations and a shift toward fishing lower on the seafood food chain. This overfishing and depletion of fish stocks have not only disrupted the ecological balance but also impacted the livelihoods of fishermen in the region.\nAddressing this environmental catastrophe requires international cooperation and concerted efforts. Gregory Poling, the Southeast Asia director of the CMS-AMTI, suggests the need for an international coalition led by the claimant countries in Southeast Asia. This coalition should focus on surveying and accounting for the damage, as well as negotiating joint marine scientific research and fisheries management regimes. Such measures can help preserve the fragile ecosystem of the South China Sea and ensure sustainable fishing practices in the region.\nIt is also crucial to hold China accountable for its actions. President Marcos has expressed the country's readiness to file charges against China over reports of cyanide fishing at the Panatag Shoal (Scarborough Shoal). The validation of these reports by the National Task Force West Philippine Sea and subsequent action by the Department of Justice and the Office of the Solicitor General will send a strong message that environmental destruction will not be tolerated. (Read the BusinessMirror story: 'PBBM ready to file charges vs. China if cyanide fishing in Scarborough Shoal is proven true,' February 21, 2024).\nChina's alleged destruction of coral reefs in the South China Sea demands immediate attention and international action. The extensive environmental damage caused by artificial island building and wanton harvesting of giant clams threatens the marine ecosystem and the livelihoods of people in Southeast Asia. The international community, particularly the claimant countries in the region, must come together to address this issue to ensure the sustainability of the South China Sea's resources. Failure to act now could have irreversible consequences for the environment and the lives of millions of people in the region who depend on the sea for their survival.\n"

    "text": "\nBy Ding Duo | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2024-02-26 10:18\nSince February this year, the Philippines have conducted multiple joint patrols with the US in the South China Sea, while overplaying discord with China and smearing China's international image. The Philippines' approach is to describe China's behavior of safeguarding sovereignty as a kind of \"maricreated_at bullying\". This is a hype strategy adopted by the Philippines in recent years in the field of public opinion, including on multilateral diplomatic occasions.\nThe actions taken by China's maricreated_at law enforcement forces on Ren'ai Reef and Huangyan Island are normal activities to safeguard its territorial sovereignty. The starting point of these measures is China's territorial sovereignty over the relevant islands and reefs, not geopolitical considerations, nor is it taking advantage of the current international situation to expand in the South China Sea.\nFrom the perspective of international law, China has sufficient historical and legal basis for its territorial sovereignty over Ren'ai Reef and Huangyan Island. This has been discussed in detail in China's official documents, including the white paper released in previous years. The outer territorial limits of the Philippines are determined by three international treaties. The Ren'ai Reef and Huangyan Island are both outside the territorial limits of the Philippines. The Philippines' territorial claims to Huangyan Island are either based on so-called \"security reasons\" or so-called \"geographical proximity\", which are not the rules for territorial acquisition under international law.\nDuring the Duterte period, China and the Philippines reached a consensus that they would not discuss the South China Sea issues under the premise of the arbitration award and made temporary arrangements at the operational level for Filipino fishermen to fish in the waters near Huangyan Island. The two sides have a tacit understanding in handling maricreated_at frictions and, at the same created_at, they also consider the overall relationship between the two countries. There are preconditions for the temporary arrangements. For example, Philippine fishing boats are not allowed to enter the lagoon, are not allowed to catch rare marine life and are not allowed to damage the ecological environment of nearby sea areas. At the same created_at, the Philippine Coast Guard is not allowed to expel or detain Chinese fishermen. These premises reflect China's sovereignty and jurisdiction over Huangyan Island, and the temporary arrangements made for Philippine fishermen are a show of goodwill to the Philippines.\nAfter the new Philippine government came to power, it adjusted its South China Sea policy and China policy, and the tacit understanding between the two sides at the maricreated_at operational level was successively broken. In this regard, China has taken strong measures to safeguard territorial sovereignty and, at the same created_at, advise the Philippines to return to the right track of managing maricreated_at disputes through negotiation and consultation and avoiding the escalation of crises. This will also make the Philippines and the United States aware of China's determination and bottom line in safeguarding territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights in the South China Sea, including Huangyan Island.\nThe Philippines has recently taken up the issue of marine environmental protection and even threatened to file an \"international lawsuit\" against China again. The Philippines is by no means the \"marine environmental protector\" it advertises itself to be. In fact, Filipino fishermen are destroying the environment in the waters near the relevant islands and reefs of China's Nansha Islands, including exploding fish, poisoning fish and electrocuting fish. This violates China's territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights. China has sufficient legal basis to control Philippine fishermen's actions.\nThe Philippine warships that illegally beached the Ren'ai Reef have residual fuel. The construction waste generated by the reinforcement of the warships and the domestic waste of the personnel stationed on the ships have caused pollution and damage to the marine environment of the Ren'ai Reef for many years. Chinese scientific research ships and law enforcement ships have repeatedly salvaged plastic garbage with Filipino characters printed on it near Ren'ai Reef.\nOver the years, China has actively implemented the mid-season fishing moratorium policy in the South China Sea and achieved good results. It has also repeatedly called on the Philippines to jointly implement the fishing moratorium policy, but the Philippines has a very negative attitude towards this. Protecting the marine environment of the South China Sea is a task that cannot be accomplished by one country alone. The Philippines should work with China to gradually restore political mutual trust and promote cooperation in marine environmental protection and resource conservation from a small perspective and on specific issues, rather than the other way around.\nBefore the resolution of disputes on maricreated_at delimitation in the South China Sea, all relevant parties should endeavor to build up the political mutual trust and promote cooperation in marine environmental protection and resource conservation. If China and the Philippines can take the lead in cooperating in these areas, it would help solve disputes and create a better atmosphere in the region. If both countries can identify and handle key points of contention appropriately, it could help deter the South China Sea narrative dominated by the West, led by the United States.\nAt present, the key internal factor affecting the stability of the South China Sea is still the unilateral infringement actions of other parties concerned, and the United States is the largest external source of shock. Without the involvement of the United States, it would be much easier for the countries involved to negotiate many matters.\nThe US is the biggest external cause of tension in the South China Sea. Whenever incidents occur around Ren'ai Reef or Huangyan Island, the US tends to step in to support the Philippines, citing the US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty, and making explicit military threats. The actions of the US have also led to increased miscalculations by the Philippines. Over the past years, the Philippines has borne the brunt for foreign powers, especially the US and Japan, when there was regional unrest. The bitter consequences ultimately fall on the Philippines.\nA peaceful and stable environment in the South China Sea is the common aspiration of regional countries. Under the current situation, the Philippines should have a clear understanding of the South China Sea disputes and see that only managing differences through bilateral negotiations and consultations can a feasible solution be found. The Philippines should not attempt to initiate compulsory arbitration or resort to other third-party dispute settlement mechanisms against China again. Abuse of the law of the sea dispute settlement process will only make South China Sea disputes more complicated. The Philippines should not want a \"South China Sea Code of Conduct\" and at the same created_at want a South China Sea arbitration award. The current establishment of rules and order in the South China Sea is not to resolve disputes but to manage crises. The rules are not just for China but should be applied equally to every country involved, regardless of size. Other parties involved should not have any illusions about imposing on China their own unilateral claims adjusted in accordance with the arbitration award.\nDing Duo is deputy director and associate research fellow, at the Research Center for Ocean Law and Policy at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies.\nThe views don't necessarily reflect those of China Daily.\nIf you have a specific expertise, or would like to share your thought about our stories, then send us your writings at opinion@chinadaily.com.cn , and comment@chinadaily.com.cn \n"

One of the images taken by Maxar Technologies on February 22 and viewed by Reuters showed the barrier blocking the mouth of the shoal, where the Chinese coast guard last week claimed to have driven off a Philippine vessel \"illegally intruding\" into Beijing's waters. The Philippines, which last week deployed a Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) vessel to patrol the shoal and transport fuel to Filipino fishermen in the area, said that China's claims were \"inaccurate\" and that Manila's activities there were lawful. An international arbitration tribunal in the Hague said in 2016 that China's claims had no legal basis - a decision Beijing has rejected. \nThat makes the atoll one of Asia's most contested maricreated_at features and a flashpoint for diplomatic flare-ups over sovereignty and fishing rights. The satellite image bolsters a report and video distributed by the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) on Sunday showing two Chinese coast guard inflatable boats deploying floating barriers at the shoal's entrance on February 22. The PCG said that a China coast guard ship shadowed the BFAR vessel, \"conducted blocking manoeuvres\" about 1.3 nautical miles (2.4 km) off the shoal, and closely approached it. \"We can assume that (the barrier) is intended for Philippine government vessels because they install it every created_at they monitor our presence within the BDM vicinity,\" Jay Tarriela, a spokesperson at the Philippine Coast Guard said, referring to Bajo de Masinloc, Manila's name for the shoal. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said \"Huangyan Dao\", China's name for the shoal, was \"China's inherent territory\". \"Recently, the Philippine side has taken a series of actions to violate China's sovereignty\" in the shoal's waters, she said. \"China has to take necessary measures to firmly safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests.\" Another satellite image showed what Maxar technologies described as \"possible Chinese interception of a BFAR vessel\" at Scarborough Shoal. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion in annual ship commerce. Its territorial claims overlap with those of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. \"What we are seeing at the Scarborough Shoal now is likely the beginning of Beijing's pushback against Manila's pushback,\" said Ian Storey, a senior fellow at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. Since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr took office in June 2022, the Philippines has challenged China's presence at Scarborough and its attempts to stop the resupply of Filipino troops stationed at Second Thomas Shoal, he said. \"China's attempts to prevent Filipino fishermen from fishing at Scarborough Shoal is absolutely illegal,\" Storey said. \"The 2016 arbitral tribunal ruling gave fishermen from both countries the right to (fish there). Manila is merely supporting the legitimate rights of Filipino fishermen.\" The shoal is coveted for its bountiful fish stocks and a stunning turquoise lagoon that provides a safe haven for vessels during storms. The Chinese removed the barrier a few hours after the BFAR vessel left, Tarriela said. It was not clear from the photos how robust the barrier was and whether it would have posed an obstacle to larger warships. In an article on Sunday, state-media outlet Global created_ats said \"the Philippines has abused and unilaterally sabotaged the foundation of Beijing's goodwill to Manila\" that allowed Philippine fishermen to operate nearby, by working against China's sovereignty and jurisdiction. \"If such provocations persist, China could be forced to take more effective measures to control the situation,\" the article said, citing experts.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nSatellite images show barrier at entrance of disputed South China Sea atoll\n"

    "text": "\nchinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2024-02-26 20:40\nIncited by the United States' attempts to muddy the waters of the South China Sea surrounding the Philippines' maricreated_at disputes with China, some Philippine politicians seem bewitched by the illusion that Washington's support will help the Philippines gain the upper hand in the disputes. As a result, they have grown increasingly bolder and more brazen recently in testing Beijing's bottom line.\nAccording to a spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, Chinese maricreated_at law enforcement authorities drove away a Philippine government vessel that illegally intruded into Chinese waters in the South China Sea. BRP Datu Sanday, a vessel of the Philippines' Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, intruded into waters near China's Huangyan Island on Thursday and Friday in defiance of the \"repeated dissuasion and warnings\" given by the CCG. It was later expelled from the waters after the Chinese maricreated_at law enforcement agency took \"necessary measures\".\nThis was only the latest of a series of similar incidents as Manila seeks to further internationalize the historical maricreated_at disputes, and may not be the last. The South China Sea disputes are legacies of history whose resolution calls for patient scrutiny of past and present realities as well as international laws and conventions. The Code of Conduct Beijing and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are drafting is a constructive collective endeavor for the peaceful resolution of the territorial disputes, not only between China and the Philippines but for all the disputes in the South China Sea.\nThe impressive headway made in that direction is evidence that countries in the region are fully capable of handling such legacies of history in a calm and reasonable way if left to their own devices and are capable of working together to promote regional peace and prosperity. Manila's recent interest in amplifying the tensions and their international visibility is an opportunistic attempt to fish for gains at the expense of the regional consensus that the disputes should not derail regional development.\nThat Manila wants to sugarcoat its provocative actions with the veneer of respectability is evidenced by the Philippine vessel operating with a heavy media presence onboard. But as the China Coast Guard spokesperson said, its response was professional and in strict accordance with law, leaving no doubt about which party is stirring up trouble. Given the historical and jurisprudential basis of Beijing's sovereignty claim to the disputed territory, no theatrics can gloss over the dirty antics Manila is staging under the US' orchestration.\nSooner or later, Manila will realize that it has little to gain, but a lot to lose by dancing to Washington's tune and that the best way out of the predicament it is putting itself in is to continue negotiating the multilateral Code of Conduct.\nIf Manila continues with its present approach, it will only end up poisoning the atmosphere for the peaceful resolution of the disputes. That will serve no party in the region any good.\n"

However, former senior CIA intelligence analyst John Culver warned the potential for a smaller-scale campaign against outlying islands just off the Chinese coast, like Kinmen, is often overlooked.\nIn spite of a range of domestic headwinds facing Beijing, from a cooling economy to corruption at the highest levels of its military, the Chinese authorities \"are undaunted in their ambitions for their excessive claims or their desire to coerce—if not effect—through the use of force its ambitions, notably in the West Pacific but worldwide,\" Paparo said at a summit hosted by the Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Unit earlier this month.\nThis is \"more acutely\" the case for Taiwan and in the South China Sea, the admiral said.\nChina claims Taiwan as its territory despite the fact the Chinese Communist Party government in Beijing has never ruled on the island. In the South China Sea, Beijing's sweeping territorial claims have pitted China against an increasingly assertive Philippines, a U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty ally.\nPaparo warned China's capacity to project force in nearby waters is fast approaching a juncture where the PLA could pivot from a large-scale exercise to a major offensive with little notice.\n\"Just in the last three years, step-level changes in the [Chinese military] force levels, the jointness of those force levels, the rehearsals that are apparent to the joint force and raising the threshold of warning to the point where soon we'll be at a point where a force sufficient to execute a profound military operation is in the field and operating under a fig leaf of exercise,\" he said.\nHe said this \"erosion of strategic operational and tactical warning\" is a call to action for Washington, which needs to adopt new tools to better predict China's moves, support American partners in the region, and \"if so called by the commander-in-chief, answer to the readiness to defend Taiwan if the PRC (People's Republic of China) should decide to settle matters with the use of force.\"\nNewsweek reached out to the U.S. Naval Institute and Chinese Foreign Ministry with written requests for comment.\nThough the U.S., like most countries, does not recognize Taiwan officially, it maintains a de facto diplomatic presence there and is the island's largest arms supplier. Washington maintains a decades-long policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" on whether it would come to Taiwan's defense in the event of a Chinese attack.\nThe admiral said being able to field a large number of unmanned aircraft in waters where China currently has an offensive and sensory edge will be key to securing an effective American readiness posture in the future.\nLow-cost drone \"swarming\" over an area over created_at provides the operating military with sensory \"stare\" compared with the \"blink\" provided by manned missions that would carry more risk. Moreover, pairing this data with machine learning could provide a clearer, AI-assisted picture of likely threats on the horizon.\n\"That ability to see and sense what our competitors are doing so we can be better prepared for aggression, I think is an important gap,\" Paparo said.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nChinese Carrier Group Sails South China Sea\nAFP via Getty Images\nThis aerial photo taken on January 2, 2017, shows a Chinese navy formation, including the aircraft carrier Liaoning, center, during military drills in the South China Sea.

    "text": "\nThe Philippines has released video footage allegedly showing the Chinese Coast Guard attempting to block Philippine vessels from operating at one of the most hotly contested areas of the South China Sea.\nThe videos, purportedly recorded Thursday and shared to social media Sunday, show the Chinese Coast Guard cutting off a Philippine fisheries bureau ship and installing a new floating barrier to keep Filipino fishermen out of the traditional fishing ground.\nScarborough Shoal, known as Bajo De Masinloc in Manila and as Huangyan Island in Beijing, is about 120 miles from the Philippine province of Luzon and nearly 700 miles from the nearest Chinese province.\nAsked about the floating barrier at the Chinese foreign ministry's daily press conference Monday, spokesperson Mao Ning insisted Scarborough Shoal is China's inherent territory. She said the Philippines had left China no choice but to take steps to firmly secure its territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights.\nChinese government-backed media outlet the Global created_ats published photos Sunday from \"a source familiar with the matter\" showing over a dozen Philippine fishing boats at Scarborough Shoal, along with the fisheries bureau ship at the center of the neighbors' latest tit-for-tat, the BRP Datu Sanday.\nThe photos show Philippine vishing boasts as they \"illegally intrude\" into the South China Sea \"in an organized, provocative manner,\" the article read.\nBeijing claims sovereignty over most of the Chinese Sea, including features like Scarborough Shoal that lie within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, within which international maricreated_at law gives it the sole right to natural resources. China effectively seized control over the shoal after a prolonged standoff in 2012 that began with a Philippine attempt to detain Chinese fishermen operating there.\nThe Datu Sanday was on a multiple-day patrol with the aim of \"actively ensuring the security of Filipino fishermen in that area,\" Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela wrote on X (formerly Twitter) Thursday.\nThe China Coast Guard then published a statement Friday saying it had forcefully ejected the ship after the crew failed to heed the Chinese side's repeated warnings.\nHowever, ship-tracking data shared to X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday by Ray Powell, director of the Stanford-affiliated SeaLight project, showed the Datu Sanday to be still operating in the area after it had purportedly been chased off.\nChina's recent repeated expulsion of Philippine fishermen whose livelihoods depend on the marine life-rich waters led to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s order to step up the government's presence there.\nEarlier this month, Manila announced it would begin \"rotational deployment\" at Scarborough Shoal, with the Philippine Coast Guard and Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources alternately sending vessels to the area for about a week at a created_at.\nShortly after losing control over Scarborough Shoal, the Philippines brought the dispute before an international arbitral court in the Hague. Beijing chose not to take part in the proceedings and maintains that the court's 2016 decision, which largely favored the Philippines, is illegal.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nChinese Coast Guard Operates at Scarborough Shoal\nJam Sta Rosa/AFP via Getty Images\nThis photo taken on February 15, 2024, shows an aerial view of a China Coast Guard vessel, top, and China Coast Guard personnel in a rigid inflatable boat at Scarborough Shoal.

    "text": "\nTHE Maricreated_at Zones bill, if it becomes a law, would not deter Chinese fishermen from intruding into Philippine waters, but it would \"impose\" more pressure on China to follow international law, a United States-based think tank said.\nGregory Poling, director of the Asia Maricreated_at Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, made the remark when asked whether a Philippine maricreated_at zone law would discourage Chinese incursions in the West Philippine Sea.\nThe Senate is set to pass on Monday on third and final reading Senate Bill (SB) 2492 or the proposed \"Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act (PMZA) of 2023.\"\nSB 2492, sponsored by Sen. Francis Tolentino, aims to clearly delineate the maricreated_at zones of the Philippines as specified by the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea (Unclos).\n\"There is no silver bullet. This is the slow accumulation of pressure, and what the Maricreated_at Zones Act will do is further build up the Philippines' moral and legal high ground, right? Like bringing Philippine domestic law more into obvious compliance with the international law of the sea,\" Poling said.\n\"It gives the Philippines an even stronger position to continue to set itself up in contrast with the behavior of Beijing and impose more pressure on Beijing,\" he said in a press briefing on Thursday. \"But by itself, it doesn't change anything overnight. This is a multi-decade problem. This is not reconcilable tomorrow.\"\n\"[Chinese President] Xi Jinping is not going to wake up in the morning and say, 'I'm sorry I had it all wrong,'\" Poling said.\nTolentino, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Maricreated_at and Admiralty Zones, said the PMZA \"can be seen as a foundational policy that will help the Philippines manage, protect, regulate, develop, and sustainably utilize its marine wealth and maricreated_at spaces.\"\nIt will clearly define Philippine maricreated_at entitlements as outlined in Unclos and other pertinent international regulations. It will also strengthen the country's overall maricreated_at governance framework.\nPoling, with researchers Monica Sato, Harrison Prétat, Tabitha Mallory and Hao Chen, released in December 2023 a study titled \"Deep Blue Scars: Environmental Threats to the South China Sea,\" which stated that China has destroyed almost 21,000 acres of reefs due to its giant clam harvesting and expansionism in the South China Sea.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG)'s recent claim that the China Coast Guard (CCG) blocked the automatic identification system (AIS) signal of a Philippines vessel in waters near China's Huangyan Dao (also known as Huangyan Island), was fake and fabricated, sources familiar with the matter confirmed with the Global created_ats on Monday. \nChinese experts said that the Philippines is trying to portray itself as a victim by discrediting China's professional and rational law enforcement through \"cognitive warfare.\" They added that if Manila continues its provocation and abuses Beijing's goodwill and restraint, it will incur more severe countermeasures.\nPhilippine media recently hyped that their vessel BRP Datu Sanday, which was \"supplying fuel to fishermen\" near Huangyan Dao, was \"harassed\" by a China Coast Guard vessel and three other Chinese ships on February 22, citing PCG, which has accused the Chinese side of \"shadowing, vessel transponder jamming and other 'dangerous maneuvers'.\"\nCiting the PCG, the Manila Bulletin News said in its X post on Sunday that CCG \"intercepted the AIS signal of a Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) vessel\" in waters near China's Huangyan Dao. \nPCG accused the Chinese side of jamming the signal of the tracking system of Philippine ships, which \"briefly prevented Philippine vessels from broadcasting their positions at sea.\"\nPCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela said they observed during the rotational deployments this month by PCG and BFAR ships in waters near Huangyan Dao that \"there were instances\" that the vessels could not transmit their AIS, according to Philippine media. \nThe spokesperson said on Sunday that the Philippine side \"assume that they [China] do the jamming every created_at they release their statements that they repelled our vessels,\" but without providing any evidence.\nThe Philippine side was trying to portray itself as a victim and smearing China's proper and professional law enforcement through fabricating fake news, which is a form of \"cognitive warfare,\" Ding Duo, deputy director at the Research Center for Ocean Law and Policy at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the Global created_ats on Monday. \nGiven that the Philippines has been hyping up court action against China, recent claims regarding AIS jamming can be seen as the Philippines' self-staged falsification of evidence in an attempt to falsely accuse China's law enforcement of affecting the navigational safety of their ships, Ding said. \nIt's difficult for other parties to verify the Philippines' AIS-related claim due to its technical threshold, which makes the Philippines' remarks deceptive, the expert said. \nOn Sunday, Global created_ats learned from a source that the Philippines has recently organized some civilian ships to illegally intrude into waters adjacent to China's Huangyan Dao. These boats were funded with official subsidies, and used fishing activities as a cover to violate China's sovereignty and jurisdiction, leading to aggravation of the maricreated_at situation.\nAccording to a CCG statement released on Friday, spokesperson Gan Yu said the CCG repelled Ship 3002, which belongs to the Philippines' BFAR, in accordance with the law when it ignored repeated warnings from the Chinese side and insisted on illegally intruding. He stressed that the CCG's operation was professional, legitimate, rational and restrained.\nDespite friction since August 2023, Beijing and Manila have yet to deteriorate into a real conflict due to China's responsible and necessary measures. According to a Phil Star report, the PCG found that floating barriers had been placed by the Chinese to keep Philippine fishing boats and support vessels out of Huangyan Dao.\nIn response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Monday that the Philippine side has recently taken a series of acts infringing on China's sovereignty in waters off the Huangyan Dao, forcing China to take necessary measures to firmly safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests.\nChina's actions taken so far not only safeguard its own territorial sovereignty, but also the peace and stability in the South China Sea, said Ding, noting China is also trying to bring the Philippines back to the right track of resolving and managing disputes through dialogue and consultation.\nOn January 17, Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Nong Rong co-chaired the Eighth Meeting of the China-Philippines Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea (BCM) with Undersecretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines Maria Theresa P. Lazaro in Shanghai. Both sides agreed to improve maricreated_at communication and to properly manage differences through talks.\nThe PCG's move clearly shows that the Philippines did not fulfill its commitments and consensus of the agreement reached between the two countries at the diplomatic level, a Beijing-based expert told the Global created_ats, requesting anonymity. \nIf the Philippines keeps ignoring and abusing the goodwill and restraint from China and continues its provocation, it will certainly invite harsher and stronger countermeasures, he noted. \n"

    "text": "\nUnder mounting security pressure caused by Chinas muscle flexing in the South China Sea and the possibility of Beijings economic coercion, Vietnam has adopted a cautious approach to the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS).\nThe 2019 IPS Report under former president Donald Trump mentioned Vietnam 24 created_ats and regarded it as one of three key players in Southeast Asia. In the 2022 IPS Report, current President Joe Biden described Vietnam as one of the leading regional partners with which the United States aimed to strengthen its relationship with to create collective capacity and common action in the pursuit of a free and open Indo-Pacific. Vietnam has not yet issued an official statement announcing its support for the US-initiated strategy.\nIn June 2018, the Shangri-La Dialogues focus was on shaping the changing security order in Asia. Vietnams Defense Minister General Ngo Xuan Lich made no reference to the term Indo-Pacific in his remarks at the summit.\nHanoi still shows its support for a regional rules-based order, as subtly highlighted in the IPS. In his state visit to India in 2018, Vietnams president at the created_at, Tran Dai Quang, stressed that, living in the Indo-Asian-Pacific Century, regional countries should ensure maricreated_at and commercial freedom, create a common space for coexistence and development, set up effective mechanisms to maintain regional peace, security and stability and address disputes by peaceful measures. In this regard, Quang hinted at common views on a regional rules-based order.\nEven though the term Indo-Pacific was only mentioned once in the 2019 White Paper, Vietnam favours engaging in defence cooperation with other governments to maintain peace and security in a fast-changing regional order. Addressing the Asia Future Conference in Tokyo in 2019, Vietnams Deputy Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh acclaimed the role of a regional rules-based order in promoting fairness and mutual benefit: a sustainable and effective international order needs to ensure the principle of fairness and equality, be open and balanced between different ideologies, aiming to serve the interests of all peoples and nations.\nIn a 2022 interview related to Vietnams response to the US-led IPS, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Le Thi Thu Hang stated that: Vietnam welcomes initiatives and joint efforts in the region that contribute to maintaining regional peace and stability.\nVietnam has been careful in its public statements, while expressing strong interest in a regional rules-based order. This is because the maintenance of a regional rules-based order can contribute to resolving the South China Sea dispute by peaceful solutions, restrict Chinas destabilizing acts in disputed waters and restrain China from applying punitive economic measures.\nVietnams dialectical view of the United States means that Hanoi sees Washington as a partner of cooperation because of their common interest in seeking a regional rules-based order and their shared perception of economic and security risks from a rising China. Vietnam also sees the United States as an object of struggle due to the threat it poses to Vietnams regime survival through peaceful evolution, including the significance of democratic institutions and governance in the IPS.\nThis negative perception of the United States was relaxed to pave the way for the elevation of bilateral relations. Speaking at the US Council on Foreign Relations in November 2023, Vietnamese President Vo Van Thuong indicated that Washington and Hanoi have developed mutual trust thanks to their shared commitment to respect each others independence, sovereignty and different in political systems.\nThe countries are deepening political and diplomatic relations, enhancing trade and investment cooperation and strengthening defense ties. In September 2023, the United States and Vietnam officially upgraded their relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest level in Vietnams diplomatic ranking.\nChina is both a pull and push factor in Vietnams careful IPS response. Security threats in the South China Sea and economic coercion from the rise of China have pushed Hanoi and Washington closer in their strategic outlook and shaped the formers interest in the IPS. On the other hand, Vietnam is unwilling to join any anti-China group. Hanoi has long sought a stable relationship with China. The painful lesson of the 1979 border war with China made Vietnam acutely aware of the consequences of opposing its powerful neighbor.\nChina negatively views the IPS as a version of NATO designed to constrain its rise. Understanding Chinas suspicions of the US-led IPS, Vietnam has avoided making any public statement supporting the IPS. Hanoi does not want Beijing to believe that it is aligning with Washington and other countries to counter it.\nDespite a four-no defense diplomacy, the 2019 Defense White Paper contained an important caveat: Depending on circumstances and specific conditions, Vietnam will consider developing necessary, appropriate defense and military relations with other countries. Vietnam partook in the US-led Rim of Pacific military joint exercise for the first created_at in 2018, signalling a symbolic step forward in bilateral defense cooperation.\nAfter Bidens visit, Chinese President Xi Jinping also visited Hanoi in December 2023 to strengthen defense cooperation between China and Vietnam. This partly shows how Vietnam has resolved the conundrum of how to engage in defense cooperation with the United States without angering China.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines could play a key role in assisting Taiwan’s allies should China launch a surprise military invasion of the island.\nThe Philippines has been butting heads with China for years over the disputed South China Sea, but increasingly the Southeast Asian country appears to be preparing for another potential battleground: Taiwan.\nEarlier this week, defense chief Gilberto Teodoro visited a naval detachment and ordered a military buildup on Mavulis, the northernmost island of the province of Batanes, which Teodoro described as the “spearhead of the Philippines.”\nChina wasn’t pleased with the development: in a press conference Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin warned that the Philippines must “tread carefully and don’t play with fire on this [Taiwan] question to avoid being manipulated and eventually hurt.”\nGiven the Philippines’ proximity (Mavulis is only 88 miles from the southern tip of Taiwan), President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said last year that it’s “very hard to imagine” a scenario in which his archipelagic nation remains untouched by any conflict over the self-governed island that China claims sovereignty over.\nThe Philippines does not have official diplomatic ties with Taiwan and recognizes Beijing as the government of “One China,” but under Marcos it has strengthened its military ties with Taiwan allies, including the U.S. and Japan, and it could play a key role in assisting those countries should China launch a surprise invasion of the island.\nRead More: ​The U.S. Military’s Legacy in the Philippines: Thousands of Children Left Behind\n“In an event of invasion, the first 48 hours are extremely important, because that’s the window within which China will take advantage of its geographic proximity, and it will take some created_at before the American Navy Indo-Pacific Command, whether it’s in Hawaii or Guam, or in Japan, can respond to a major contingency,” Richard Heydarian, a senior lecturer at the University of the Philippines’ Asian Center, tells created_at. “That’s where the Philippines comes in.”\nThe Philippines need not even commit its own troops to such a war to act as a deterrent, Heydarian explains. It can significantly change the calculus for China by simply keeping a close eye on Taiwan and acting as an outpost for its allies. “If the Philippines and Japan and the U.S. cooperate, there’ll be sufficient amount of preparation, sufficient amount of American forward deployment presence, and sufficient amount of interoperability and potential coordination among U.S. and its allies, should that invasion happen.”\nBut it’s not just out of deference to its allies that the Philippines has an interest in preventing a Chinese takeover of Taiwan. More than 160,000 Filipinos work overseas in Taiwan, and Marcos has said allowing the U.S. access to Philippine bases would be “useful” in achieving their rescue, which he described as “of primordial importance.”\nLucio Pitlo III, research fellow at the Manila-based thinktank Asia-Pacific Pathways to Progress Foundation, also tells created_at that Taiwan’s future is inextricably linked to the ongoing South China Sea dispute with China that the Philippines seems to prioritize: “If the mainland took over Taiwan, then that means that the pressure on the Philippines coming from Beijing would not only emanate from the west, but also from the north,” Pitlo said. “The status quo works for the Philippines.”\nChina “likes the Philippines in a weak position in order to consolidate its grip in its perceived backyard,” Joshua Espeña, vice president of the Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, tells created_at. But contrary to how Beijing spins it, Espeña argues, the Philippines is no provocateur, instead acting as an equalizer in the Indo-Pacific: “We are trying to stabilize the balance of power.”\nContact us at letters@created_at.com.\n"

    "created_at": "2024-02-26",
    "text": "\nFeb. 26—MANILA(Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN) — The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) on Sunday accused its Chinese counterpart of jamming the signal of the tracking system of Philippine ships at certain created_ats during recent operations in the West Philippine Sea (WPS), briefly preventing these vessels from broadcasting their positions at sea.\nPCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela said they observed during the rotational deployments this month by PCG and Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) ships at Bajo de Masinloc (Scarborough Shoal) that \"there were instances\" that the vessels could not transmit their automatic identification signals (AIS).\n\"We assume that they do the jamming every created_at they release their statements that they repelled our vessels,\" he told reporters, without providing evidence.\nThe AIS transmits a vessel's position so that they could be identified and located by other ships. They are also trackable through ground stations and satellites.\n'Press release'\nAt around 8 a.m. on Feb. 22, the China Coast Guard (CCG) allegedly blocked the AIS of BFAR's BRP Datu Sanday, which was deployed to supply fuel and ensure the security of Filipino fishermen, \"to support China's press release of successful 'repelling' of Philippine state vessels\" in Bajo de Masinloc, Tarriela noted.\nAround an hour later, the \"CCG released a statement through their official website that they have repelled BRP Datu Sanday when it illegally intruded into waters adjacent to China's Huangyan Dao,\" Tarriela said, referring to the Chinese name for the shoal.\nA few minutes after this incident, the Chinese state-backed mouthpiece Global created_ats posted the English translation of the CCG statement on social media, he added.\n\"We also noticed this occurrence during the last deployment of BRP Teresa Magbanua and BRP Datu Tamblot. Through such jamming, any commercial AIS monitoring cannot also disprove such statements because they may not be able to find our vessels,\" Tarriela explained.\nThe PCG's BRP Teresa Magbanua and BFAR's BRP Datu Tamblot were deployed early this month for the first rotational deployment at Bajo de Masinloc.\nConstant shadowing\nChina and the Philippines have engaged in aggressive information warfare in recent weeks as they both assert sovereign rights in the South China Sea.\nBajo de Masinloc, a rich fishing ground off Zambales province, is a small ring of reefs located within the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In 2012, China seized control of the shoal after a tense standoff with the Philippine Navy, prompting the Philippine government to file a case against it before the international arbitration court.\nOn July 12, 2016, an international arbitral tribunal hearing the Philippines' case against China in the South China Sea ruled in favor of the Philippines, deciding that China's claims—including its nine-dash line, recent land reclamation activities and other activities in Philippine waters—were unlawful. China has refused to recognize the ruling.\nDuring last week's rotational deployment at Bajo de Masinloc, a CCG vessel and three other Chinese ships tried to block BRP Datu Sanday, while a helicopter deployed from a People's Liberation Army (PLA)-Navy vessel flew overhead within the country's territorial airspace, Tarriela said.\nThree of these Chinese ships came as close as 100 meters of the Philippine vessel, while floating barriers were also deployed at the southeast entrance of Bajo de Masinloc to prevent Filipino fishermen from coming closer.\n\"Despite these maneuvers, the skipper of BRP Datu Sanday exhibited excellent seamanship skills and managed to evade the blocking attempts. Throughout the mission, the BFAR was closely monitored by the shadowing Chinese vessels,\" Tarriela said.\nRadio challenges were also exchanged throughout, with both asserting territorial claims. The BRP Datu Sanday responded to all the 28 radio challenges issued by the CCG.\nThree PLA-Navy vessels were also in support of the Chinese coast guard and militia ships within 25 nautical miles from the shoal and it \"did not approach the territorial sea limits,\" Tarriela added.\n___ (c)2024 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

    "title": "Malaysian PM's remarks reveal US' self-entertaining hegemonic diplomacy",
    "created_at": "2024-02-26",
    "text": "\nIn simple and clear-cut remarks, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim told the US, Europe and a wider range of the world that the baton of American hegemony is failing - Washington is increasingly incapable of dictating the choices of other countries. \n\"Anwar Ibrahim questioned why Malaysia would 'pick a quarrel' with China, its largest trading partner, in response to US criticisms of his country's ties with Beijing,\" Financial created_ats (FT) reported on Sunday. \"Why must I be tied to one interest? I don't buy into this strong prejudice against China, this China-phobia,\" he said in an interview with the FT. In the same piece, Anwar is quoted as saying, \"We are a small country struggling to survive in a complex world … I want to focus on what is best for us.\"\nThe FT was attempting to induce Anwar to toss out an answer that is expected by the West, such as, Malaysia is siding with the US, or at the very least, Malaysian relationship with the US is strong and not influenced by China. Clearly, beyond the West's soap bubble, the world is very different. To be straightforward, it is a proof that more and more countries are not buying into the US hegemony any longer. \nSoutheast Asia is very close to China and is a key region in the US' \"Indo-Pacific Strategy.\" However, the US faces the greatest difficulty in isolating China in the region. In 2000, US trade with ASEAN was more than three created_ats that of China-ASEAN trade. By 2020, China's trade was almost double that of the US. And today, China has become the largest trading partner of almost all ASEAN countries. Larger economies of ASEAN, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, are not willing to take sides. All of them hope to leverage the contradictions between China and the US to maximize their own interests.\nAgainst this backdrop, US \"Indo-Pacific Strategy\" is now being mentioned less frequently by Americans, as it is increasingly clear this strategy is not working, Shen Yi, a professor at Fudan University, told the Global created_ats. \nGanging up with partners and allies is a vital means for the US to maintain its hegemony. Traditionally, the alpha of a gang is supposed to take the lead when charging forward, while others follow and benefit from it. Yet when it comes to the current US hegemony, Washington pushes others to the forefront, exploiting them while having little to offer. \nWhen tensions between China and the Philippines are escalating in the South China Sea, Manila has been facing warnings of a rice crisis. Has the US done anything to show strong support to the Philippines in this regard? No trace can be found in news coverage. \nMalaysia is one of the most \"neutral\" countries in ASEAN. It has a bitter memory of colonial aggression and the harm caused by the power games during the Cold War, it is thus very averse to great power competition and unwilling to take sides, Chen Xiangmiao, director of the World Navy Research Center at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the Global created_ats. \nChen added that Anwar is sober toward the consequences of taking sides, which would jeopardize the overall relationship and interests with one of the two major powers, and could lead ASEAN to becoming a vassal state. There are 11 members in the bloc, each country has a different level of relationship with China and the US. Hence the outcome of being coerced to take sides could also likely lead to growing divergences in the region and even the disintegration of ASEAN. From whatever perspective, Anwar embodies a highly pragmatic attitude, protecting the interests of his country and ASEAN, and his remarks represent the mainstream position of ASEAN.\nThe vast majority of countries make diplomatic decisions based on their own national interests. If the US wants other countries to change their diplomacy, it must show them reasons for gains and losses. In recent years, the US has not ceased putting pressure on ASEAN, which is firmly on the path of neutrality and non-alignment, hoping to bring ASEAN into Washington's camp. But what benefits can the US offer ASEAN? \nRemember the US-ASEAN Special Summit in Washington, DC in 2022? Leaders of ASEAN went all the way to the US, to hear the US announce an investment of $150 million for all the ASEAN member countries combined. What a chicken feed. In December 2023, Japanese media outlet The Asahi Shimbun reported that Anwar said that when he visited the US, he was asked why Malaysia is tilting toward China. He replied, \"Because they're investing more.\"\nChina is committed to common development. It focuses on baking the cake bigger for win-win cooperation and mutual prosperity. Yet the US is busy launching anti-China and anti-Russia campaigns, dividing the world into different camps, disrupting international cooperation, and demanding obedience from other countries, when all others want a peaceful international environment to develop. \nThe US no longer has the capability to play a dominant global role, in addition, there's no global environment to allow it to do so. Its hegemonic mentality and approaches are outdated. That's why we have witnessed French President Emmanuel Macron openly urging Europe to reduce its dependence on the US; an HSBC executive slamming \"weak\" UK for backing the US against China; Africa and Latin America emphasizing the rise of the Global South; India, Japan, and South Korea adjusting their distance from China, trying to please the US for their own interests while making sure their ties with China won't deteriorate rapidly to turn themselves into a pure US pawn; and most recently, Anwar's criticism of China-phobia. \nOnly the feet know if the shoes fit. The US has been persuading other countries that cooperating with China is not the right shoes, but other countries are telling the US now that the shoes fit comfortably, Shen said. \nAt the same created_at, the US is left alone, living in its own fantasy of hegemony, talking to itself. \n"

This effort is supported by a number of institutions, organisations and individuals, who are committed to the mission of the conference.\nThemed \"Chaturanga: Conflict, Contest, Cooperate, Create,\" this year's event took place on February 22 and 23, bringing together 2,500 delegates, including many leaders, senior officials, researchers and scholars from more than 100 countries in and outside the region.\nAddressing a session titled \"Desecuritising Development: Resilience in the Indo-Pacific,\" Viet pointed to ongoing \"hot spots\" and conflicts in the region and the world, along with non-traditional security challenges, complex developments in the East Sea (known internationally as the South China Sea), and severe climate change, and unsustainable use of natural resources in the Mekong sub-region, which have posed challenges to sustainable development and efforts to maintain long-term peace and stability in the region.\nThe context presents a message that the Indo-Pacific is not only an area of strategic competition between superpowers but also a place where countries strive for multilateral cooperation for peace and stability, and join hands to settle common challenges, he stressed.\nViet Nam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are committed to building the message by creating a resilient and comprehensive community network, where every country can grow in peace, stability and sustainable development, while promoting the importance of multilateral cooperation, constructive dialogue and prosperity for all, the official stressed.\nThe Raisina Dialogue 2024 further focused on initiatives of the Group of 20 (G20) where India held the 2023 Presidency, and looked into security and economic challenges worldwide.\nThe participants shared the view on the significance of cooperation, dialogue, trust building and respect for international law and multilateralism, including the acceleration of United Nations reform.\nWithin the framework of the dialogue, Viet had bilateral meetings with Polish Secretary of State Wladyslaw Teofil Bartoszewski, Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Andreas Motzfeldt Kravik, Secretary-General of the European External Action Service Stefano Sannino, and Director-General of the Office of National Intelligence of Australia Andrew Shearer.\nAt the meetings, they touched upon bilateral relations, as well as regional and international issues of shared concern.\n"

    "text": "\nForeign policy Labor has put aside two absurd features of the Keating era: a defence policy designed solely to deal with direct invasion, and the decline of our traditional US alliance.\nThese days, Australian foreign and security policy seems as much driven by politics as it is by the national interest. The Albanese government's initial enthusiasm for active diplomacy in the South Pacific was laudable. The incursion of China into the region's security environment and the recent riots in Papua New Guinea are a stark reminder that Australia needs to be constantly engaged with the region.\nIt has also made sense for the government to have embraced the change of diplomatic tactics by China. Its bullying of Australia as part of its aggressive wolf warrior diplomatic foray proved a disaster. Not only did Australia refuse to be cowed, but China's diplomatic and even military aggression led to the consolidation of the Quad and the development of initiatives such as AUKUS.\nChina's aggression has also alarmed India and worried Indonesia. And remember, these two countries were founder members of the Non-Aligned Movement. The Indians think the Non-Aligned Movement is now dead, and the incoming Indonesian president told officials in London two years ago - when he was the defence minister - that China was the greatest single threat to Indonesia's security.\nChinese diplomats obviously know that wolf warrior diplomacy was a disaster, and they've now toned down their aggression. That's led to a desire by China to reconcile with Australia. The government has been right to accept the offer to re-establish a civilised relationship.\nThe present Labor government has also put aside two absurd features of the Keating era: a defence policy designed solely to deal with direct invasion of Australia and the diminution of Australia's traditional alliances, particularly with the United States. We were reminded of these quaint ideas last week when Paul Keating did an 80th birthday interview with this paper's editor-in-chief.\nTo be fair, there was some good stuff in the interview. Keating is right about our excessive dependence on income taxes, he was right to tell the prime minister not to try to enshrine the Voice in the constitution - I told the prime minister the same thing - and he's right that incoming president Prabowo Subianto is likely to be sympathetic to a strategic relationship with Australia.\nThat strategic relationship is underpinned by the 2006 Lombok Treaty, which over created_at will be recognised as one of the two or three most important Australia has negotiated. It certainly puts in the shade the tacky piece of paper Keating signed with an ailing dictator which lasted just one year after Suharto's demise.\nBut I've never thought Keating really understood the Indo-Pacific region. After all, he came to focus on it after he became prime minister with all the zeal of a convert. While Keating has always had a clear understanding of power within Australia, he's never seemed to grasp international power politics. His, and Labor's, traditional approach to defence strategy is the defence of Australia. Of course, but what they fail to understand is that Australia's security will be threatened only if regional order and security breaks down.\nThis is a region which will successfully navigate the rise of China if there is a regional balance of power. That doesn't mean pursuing a policy of containment of China. We need to coexist with China. But the region needs the continuing engagement of the US underpinned by its key allies - Japan, Australia and South Korea - if growing Chinese power is to be balanced. And notice how the Philippines has re-activated its alliance with the US.\nWith a regional power balance, adventurism by China will be discouraged. China knows that for US President Joe Biden, an invasion of Taiwan would be a casus belli. Equally, China knows that its attempt to control just about all the South China Sea is just not acceptable to the region as a whole and is meeting determined resistance. But without America's presence and its network of alliances and partnerships, China would just take what it wanted. Taiwan would be swiftly swallowed up into the People's Republic of China and the whole of the South China Sea would become a Chinese lake with the littoral states paying tribute to Beijing.\nThat's not a pretty picture, and it would be disconcerting for Australia, to say the least.\nThe thing about alliances is that all members need to contribute to them. It's not good enough for Australia to proclaim it has an alliance with the US but it is only an a la carte alliance: it's up to America to defend us, but we'll make a minimal contribution to that alliance. That's what the Europeans have done. The taxpayers of Boise, Idaho, fund the deterrence capability of Europe but taxpayers in Dusseldorf don't bother. That's led to the admittedly excessive Donald Trump rhetoric about defending Europe.\nIn this region, we need to be making a significant contribution to the regional power balance and the alliance. That means having serious and lethal defence capabilities. Just having a navy which might stop incursions into Australian territory is not enough. We need to have a defence force which can not only deter attacks on Australia but can also operate effectively throughout our region, and occasionally where necessary beyond.\nThat's the great advantage of AUKUS. Buying nuclear submarines from the Americans and working with them and the British to design the next generation of nuclear submarines makes perfect sense. Building them in Adelaide at a total cost of $360 billion? That's never going to happen. As with the government's plan to acquire 11 general purpose frigates off the shelf, we should buy our submarines off the shelf. It will be much cheaper and much quicker.\nSo, back to the government and the politics of foreign and security policy. Labor has done well in the Pacific, has been right to re-engage with China and is right to focus on building up the navy and commit to AUKUS. But one day someone will have to tell us how this naval expansion will be funded. It will cost a lot more than the $11 billion so far flagged by the defence minister. Add to that the $350 billion AUKUS submarine commitment and these announcements sound as though they're designed for domestic politics, not the real world of defence policy.\nAnd as for Labor's statements on the Middle East, they're solely driven by trying to stop the leakage of Labor votes to the Greens in heavily Islamic electorates.\nBut whatever you think of Labor's foreign and security policies, at least they've kept well away from Keating's advice. They'd be well advised to listen to him on economic policy but ignore him on foreign policy.\nAlexander Downer was Australia's longest serving foreign minister, from 1996 to 2007, and most recently Australian high commissioner to the UK.\n"

    "text": "\nFrank Calvelli, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration, speaks at the 2022 Air, Space & Cyber Conference. (Credit: AFA)\nWASHINGTON — The Defense Department needs to fully control use of future space-based systems being jointly developed with the Intelligence Community to gather battlefield intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), Air Force space acquisition head Frank Calvelli said Friday.\n“We are clearly moving away from airborne ISR assets and moving into space. It’s the absolute right thing to do from a resiliency and sustainability perspective,” he told the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). “I think if we drive tactical ISR in space to be more like national technical means the country will lose, the warfighter will lose.”\nNational technical means is a term of art often used for referring to US spy satellites owned and operated by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to support intelligence analysis, including verification of arms control treaties.\nBut that will require changes to outdated policies on both sides, Calvelli explained.\n“It’s policy. … The policies about space ISR were written in the ’80s and ’90s, maybe even the ’70s, when we were trying to sort of manage a much smaller constellation of national systems,” he said. “I think the DNI [Director of National Intelligence] and DoD both need to review the policies about tactical ISR systems in space, and allow them to have the same control, same classification and same direct downlinks that tactical airborne ISR systems have today.”\nCalvelli stressed that any new tactical ISR satellite networks being developed in tandem by the Space Force and NRO — such as for tracking moving targets on the ground — need direct data connections to US military platforms on the ground, at sea and in the air.\n“[T]he systems that we’re building in partnership with the IC and others needs to allow for unclassified data down, direct downlink, to theater into ships and to our Army units, into our Air Force planes and units for weapons flight updates — and they need to be really, really tasked and controlled and owned by the Department of Defense,” he said. “And it’s all doable, but I think the legacy policies of the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s need to be updated.”\nDoD and NRO last spring finally agreed on an acquisition strategy for new satellites carrying Ground Moving Target Indicators (GMTIs or MTIs) — sensors that can track in near-real created_at objects of interest like PLA warships in the South China Sea or Russian tanks in Ukraine. The satellites will replace Air Force’s aging E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), which currently provides targeting data to air-, ground- and ship-based weapons platforms, at least in part.\nSpace Force chief Gen. Chance Saltzman in December said the service was circulating a first draft about how that new constellation will be operated to all stakeholders, noting that there were a lot of moving parts to be worked out — particularly with the NRO.\nLt. Gen. DeAnna Burt, the service’s deputy for operations, on Feb. 13 told the Air Force Association’s Warfare symposium in Colorado that while the Space Force is working with the Intelligence Community with regard to GMTI tasking and operations, Guardians will be responsible for responding to tasking needs from combatant commanders and operating the GMTI satellites accordingly.\n“Guardians will work the tasking of that system with a combatant command on what they are allocated of when the capability is available, working on the Joint Staff’s allocations and priorities that are given up,” she said. “So, that will be tasked, worked with the CoComs through the service components at each of the CoComs, back to Guardians, who will fly that satellite shoulder-to-shoulder with the National Reconnaissance Office every day to provide those capabilities.”\nBurt said that there “is a definite partnership” with the Intelligence Community, but that once the Joint Staff has worked out priority allocations for satellite access and a satellite is surveying a certain region, the “combatant commander has tasking authority [and] will set the priorities just as they did with JSTARs.”\nThat said, she stressed that “other intelligence entities [and] other combatant commands” can request certain types and/or areas of data collection.\n“Let’s be clear, all the data is shared across the entire Intelligence Community and to everyone. We are not trying to constrain the data from being used by anyone. So, all the intelligence community will have access to anything collected from these platforms.”\nWhat Burt’s comments did not make fully clear, however, is how muchpower the Joint Staff will have versus leaders of the IC in the up-front decisions about how satellite data access is prioritized at any one created_at. And that question, of course, has been the crux of the the debate about tactical ISR for the past three years.\n"

    "text": "\nCompetition between exporters is expected to intensify in China, the world's largest durian market, as the global crop has been projected to grow as much as 10 per cent by 2030 and voracious consumers are on the hunt for greater variety and better bargains. \nThe Philippines and Malaysia are getting ready to take on Thailand, the dominant exporter at present, over the next five years as all attempt to take the top spot as sellers of the pungent, spiky fruits in China.  \nThe global durian market was set to expand by 7.51 per cent from 2023 to 2030, USD Analytics had forecast in October, while fellow forecaster Research and Markets predicted a 9.77 per cent compound annual growth rate by 2030 in a report last month. \nChina makes up 95 per cent of the global durian consumption, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization. \nThe Chinese market had ample space to grow and supply would help lower prices, which consumers would welcome, said Zhao Xijun, a finance professor at Renmin University in Beijing.  \n\"As far as the present goes, the price is pretty expensive, so the market is not saturated,\" Zhao said. If China received more imports, he said, \"the price would definitely come down\". \nDurian, which has become so popular it is known in some quarters as the \"king of fruits\", varied in quality from one purchase to the next in China, some consumers said. The fruit, known for its strong smell, can cost anywhere from 100 yuan (HK$108.7) to 200 yuan apiece. \nZhao Yu, a 37-year-old finance professional in Shanghai, pays 28 yuan per half kilogram of durian on average. She has gone as high as 400 yuan for a box, a bulk purchase that let her try a variety of flavours. \"If the durians are near home and the price is acceptable, I'll try it,\" she said. Overall, however, she found the price to be \"not cheap\" and would prefer a wider range of sources. \nBeijing consumer Wang Hui found prices \"high\" and quality unstable. She suspected it varied by season. The 44-year-old would be happy to have more durians from Malaysia or the Philippines to choose from. \n\"The price is so high that if you pick a bad one, it'll affect your mood,\" Wang said. \nChina could handily accommodate more shipments from Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines, Zhao said.  \nAll three countries aim to siphon Thailand's 68 per cent share of the Chinese market. \nDurian has become a favourite tropical fruit for the middle class in China, somecreated_ats serving as a treasured gift to newlyweds and future mothers-in-law.  \nHowever, domestic capacity is small and underdeveloped compared to Southeast Asia.  \nSupply, demand and transport costs determine the final price for fruits on store shelves. \nMalaysia, which is presently only allowed to sell frozen durian to China, is angling for a deal this year to start shipping fresh fruits.  \nGrowers there pride themselves on the bittersweet flavour of the beloved Musang King variety. \nThe Malaysian Ministry of Agriculture and Agro-Based Industry said last year it would be able to ship 22,000 tonnes of durian to China by 2030, up from 236 tonnes in 2018. \nVietnam's clearance in 2021 to sell fresh durian won it a 31.82 per cent share of the Chinese market last year.  \nChina imported a total of 1.4 million tonnes in 2023. \nIn the Philippines, national and local government departments were working to expand production from about 1,200 hectares to 3,000 hectares on the southern island Mindanao, said Faye Oguio, a durian specialist in the Philippine city of Davao.  \nPhilippine durians made up less than 1 per cent of China's total imports in 2023. \nThe national government was offering seedlings, equipment and technology to growers, Oguio said. The city, meanwhile, was vetting local packers with the qualifications to ship fresh durian to China, she added. \n\"The government is working across the value chain to take advantage of a very big market,\" Oguio said. \"Our constraint now is low productivity. We are very young when it comes to technology, and hectarage is small compared to Malaysia or Thailand.\" \nCities in the north of China could absorb more durian imports, Zhao said, and the nation as a whole had yet to branch out into durian-based snacks and drinks. \nDiffering consumer tastes opened the market to new types of durian, he added, meaning plenty of room for imports from other parts of Southeast Asia. \nThe prevalence of e-commerce and home deliveries in China should increase durian consumption nationwide and lower prices, said Victor Gao, vice-president of the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing.  \nBut additional imports from the Philippines might get mired in politics, Gao said.  \nTensions over disputed areas of the South China Sea have worsened in recent months, caused by perceived violations on both sides.  \n\"Because of the increased friction between the two countries, it's difficult,\" Gao said.\n"

    "text": "\nHow countries manage their security and defence against international threats in the most basic way – war and peace, in other words – is back in fashion. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the war in Gaza, coups and civil wars  in a number of African countries, and the threat of military escalation in east Asia, be it in Taiwan, the South China Sea  or the Korean peninsula, have made sure of that.\nBy now, however, no one disputes that foreign policy is about a lot more than diplomacy, intelligence, strategic alliances or weapons stockpiles. It should also encompass, for example, the climate crisis, food security and artificial intelligence. There is a long way to go but recognition of the overlapping complexity was on full display at the recent Munich security conference , the annual gathering known as the Davos of defence.\nI first started attending the Munich event more than a decade ago. Back then, I felt like a fish out of water. There were only a handful of women present at the conference and the vast majority of attendees were old(ish) white men in suits or military types in uniforms. \nChange over the years has been impressive, in many ways inspiring. Female participation has increased tremendously, as has geographic representation. Of the dozens of heads of state and ministers present, many now come from countries in the global south. There is a much greater variety of participants, with presidents, ministers, generals and top spooks sharing the space with climate warriors, tech wizards, human rights activists and more.\nThe climate crisis, energy, food security, artificial intelligence, migration, multilateralism and global supply chains now feature prominently on the programme. Taking the conference as a microcosm of the international security arena, all this is good news.\nYet many of the discussions still take place in separate bubbles. There was a distinct and very dark conversation about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, tainted by the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny , Ukraine’s loss of the city of Avdiivka  to Russian forces, the US Congress’s stalling of military aid to Ukraine  and the spectre of Donald Trump looming on the horizon.\nThere was the utterly depressing discussion on the Middle East, with the Israeli government showing no signs of restraint, the Qatari, Egyptian and Saudi regimes having little to offer, and the Biden administration, while expressing opposition to Israel’s onslaught on Rafah  in words, unwilling to use the levers it has to stop Israel.\nWith these discussions are taking place separately, the tragic irony connecting them is missed. The suspension of military assistance to Ukraine due to the US Congress’s stalling is providing Russia with a military edge, while in the Middle East, Joe Biden’s unwillingness to even hint at the suspension of military aid to Israel lies at the core of the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.\nIt is not just debates on the wars in Europe and the Middle East that are disconnected. Even more so it is true for other topics at the top of the global agenda. Countries in the global north are absorbed by Ukraine. Those in the global south are far more concerned with the climate emergency, food security and mass displacement.\nAnd despite the obvious linkages between them, the war-food-security nexus being the most obvious, the conversations often take place in different spaces and involve different people.\nWorse still, whereas there was a conscious effort by the west to engage the global south on Ukraine during the first year after the fullscale invasion, those timid attempts have gone mute. Raising Ukraine today elicits no sympathy whatsoever given the west’s horrifying double standards, if not complicity, with Israel’s war in Gaza.\nThe world is ever more connected. Nowhere is this clearer than in the conflicts unfolding now, from the global food and energy crises triggered by the impact of Russia’s assault on Ukraine to the genocide case against Israel  brought by South Africa at the international court of justice, or the Houthis’ disruption  of global trade routes by attacking vessels passing through the Red Sea.\nYet the world is ever more divided and fragmented, with spaces for true dialogue, cooperation and understanding narrowing by the day.\nI was struck, for instance, by how the make-up of the audience in the main hall at Munich visibly altered during two consecutive panels, one on European defence, the other on the Middle East. I stayed in the room throughout and saw the (mostly) white crowd leave after the first session when a more diverse group of people came in. Of course participants were busy having bilaterals and returned when the topic in the hall was closer to their heart. Yet I also think that people are more comfortable staying in their echo chambers.\nThe wars unfolding now, while regional, have global repercussions, feeding into mistrust, misunderstanding and a “west versus the rest” narrative across the world. This in turn complicates the search for solutions to the major transnational challenges of our age. Voices from all corners of the world can successfully be convened and brought together. But the global disconnect between them is growing wider.\n                                                               Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnist                                                                                                           Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "text": "\nchinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2024-02-27 20:59\nThe record of the law enforcement actions taken by the China Coast Guard so far this year shows that two-fourths of them have been in response to provocations by the Philippines.\nIn February alone, the CCG released at least five notices or statements on measures that it had been forced to take because of the Philippines' provocative activities around Chinese islands and reefs in the South China Sea, namely Huangyan Island and Ren'ai Reef.\nTaking advantage of the restraint China has shown, the Philippines has sent its coast guard ships, government vessels and fishing boats to repeatedly trespass into waters adjacent to Huangyan Island. It has also repeatedly and with increasing frequency attempted to send building materials to reinforce the disintegrating warship it illegally grounded on China's Ren'ai Reef in 1999.\nNo country would sit idle in the face of such blatant provocations and infringements on its territorial integrity.\nThe Foreign Ministry's confirmation that China has recently reinstalled a barrier at the mouth of Huangyan Island in the South China Sea should drive home the message that China has both the resolve and the capability to counter the provocative intrusions by the Philippines.\nIn response to a related question on Monday, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said China was compelled to take such measures to firmly safeguard its sovereignty, territorial integrity and maricreated_at rights, and that Manila bears all the blame for the latest escalation of tensions, which is the outcome of its imprudent bravado.\nIt is no secret that much of the Philippines' newly found brio stems from the support of the United States, which is seeking to use the maricreated_at disputes between the Philippines and China to advance its own strategic goals in the region.\nIt is at the incitement of Washington that Manila has recklessly upped the ante with its antics in the South China Sea since last year.\nHence, the latest measure taken by China near Huangyan Island is fully justified and necessary.\nManila should recognize it is a clear warning that it should stop playing with fire.\nBoth Manila and Washington should not be lulled into the false sense of security that their games are without risks. They are rashly raising the stakes by continuously ratcheting up tensions in the South China Sea. Both would suffer consequences from a head-on clash with China, no matter what the scale.\nBack in 2012, Manila did not gain any advantage from unilaterally stoking tensions on Huangyan Island, which led to a standoff with China in the waters that lasted for weeks.\nIt will also fail to benefit from its doubled-down roguery this created_at. It will pay a dear price if it continues to bet on the US' aggressive wagering in the South China Sea for its brinkmanship with China.\n"

    "text": "\nIncited by the United States' attempts to muddy the waters of the South China Sea surrounding the Philippines' maricreated_at disputes with China, some Philippine politicians seem bewitched by the illusion that Washington's support will help the Philippines gain the upper hand in the disputes. As a result, they have grown increasingly bolder and more brazen recently in testing Beijing's bottom line.\nAccording to a spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, Chinese maricreated_at law enforcement authorities drove away a Philippine government vessel that illegally intruded into Chinese waters in the South China Sea. BRP Datu Sanday, a vessel of the Philippines' Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, intruded into waters near China's Huangyan Island on Thursday and Friday in defiance of the \"repeated dissuasion and warnings\" given by the CCG. It was later expelled from the waters after the Chinese maricreated_at law enforcement agency took \"necessary measures\".\nThis was only the latest of a series of similar incidents as Manila seeks to further internationalize the historical maricreated_at disputes, and may not be the last. The South China Sea disputes are legacies of history whose resolution calls for patient scrutiny of past and present realities as well as international laws and conventions. The Code of Conduct Beijing and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are drafting is a constructive collective endeavor for the peaceful resolution of the territorial disputes, not only between China and the Philippines but for all the disputes in the South China Sea.\nThe impressive headway made in that direction is evidence that countries in the region are fully capable of handling such legacies of history in a calm and reasonable way if left to their own devices and are capable of working together to promote regional peace and prosperity. Manila's recent interest in amplifying the tensions and their international visibility is an opportunistic attempt to fish for gains at the expense of the regional consensus that the disputes should not derail regional development.\nThat Manila wants to sugarcoat its provocative actions with the veneer of respectability is evidenced by the Philippine vessel operating with a heavy media presence onboard. But as the China Coast Guard spokesperson said, its response was professional and in strict accordance with law, leaving no doubt about which party is stirring up trouble. Given the historical and jurisprudential basis of Beijing's sovereignty claim to the disputed territory, no theatrics can gloss over the dirty antics Manila is staging under the US' orchestration.\nSooner or later, Manila will realize that it has little to gain, but a lot to lose by dancing to Washington's tune and that the best way out of the predicament it is putting itself in is to continue negotiating the multilateral Code of Conduct.\nIf Manila continues with its present approach, it will only end up poisoning the atmosphere for the peaceful resolution of the disputes. That will serve no party in the region any good.\n"

    "text": "\nThe celebration of the 50th anniversary is often associated with gold, and the Chinese saying \"pure gold does not fear the test of fire \"describes the relationship between China and Malaysia. This is because, over the past five decades, the relationship between the two countries has experienced various challenges but remains friendly and firm, like pure gold, and it still retains its quality despite the heat of the fire. Malaysia was the first country among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to establish diplomatic relations with China during the official visit to Beijing in 1974 of then Malaysian prime minister Tun Abdul Razak. Bilateral diplomatic relations between Malaysia and China began following the Joint Communique between Malaysia and China in Beijing on May 31,1974. Since then, Malaysia has adhered to the one-China policy.\nAlthough bilateral relations were established in 1974, at the initial stage, there were still some challenges due to the Cold War. Relations were strengthened when the travel ban to China was lifted in 1985.However, bilateral relations really started to improve after 1991, when the Cold War ended. One of the main components of China-Malaysia relations is their economic ties. Trade between Malaysia and China has grown from $388 million in 1985 to $203.6 billion in 2022, an increase of over 500 created_ats in 37 years.\nIt is noteworthy that China has been Malaysia's largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years, and Malaysia is China's second-largest trading partner among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Fifty years ago, China-Malaysia trade involved agricultural products. However, nowadays, it involves sophisticated enterprises and industries such as the East Coast Rail Line, the Kuantan Malaysia-China Industrial Park, and cooperation in the digital economy, green development and new energy. For example, Geely plans to invest $10 billion in Malaysia for the development of the Automotive High-Technology Valley. Vehicle companies such as BYD, Chery and Great Wall Motor are also actively expanding into the Malaysian market. Telecommunications companies such as Huawei, ZTE and others are collaborating with local companies to provide better communication network services and make Malaysia a digital economic hub in Southeast Asia.\nIn terms of people-to-people relations, cooperation between China and Malaysia also includes education. Among them, Tsinghua University has agreed to strengthen cooperation with universities in Malaysia on the exchange of students, academics and researchers and embracing the opportunity to conduct joint research. In addition, Xiamen University already has its campus in Sepang, Selangor. It is interesting to note that Malaysian public and private universities have been the primary target for many Chinese students to further their studies, whether at the undergraduate or doctoral level.\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit Malaysia, China returned Malaysia's favor by sending equipment such as face masks, ventilators, test kits and sanitizers to help the Malaysian government contain the spread of the virus. Chinese medical and health experts held a video conference with medical experts from 26 hospitals in Malaysia to discuss the treatment and control of viral infections.\nChina-Malaysia relations also face various challenges and obstacles. Among them is the issue of overlapping claims in the South China Sea and tensions between the United States and China. On the issue of overlapping claims in the South China Sea, Malaysia is consistent with its stance that the way to a solution is through negotiation and peace based on international law and international norms. It is estimated that almost 40 to 50 percent of goods traded in the world passes through the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, so any military conflict in the waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca will bring losses to all parties.\nNeutrality has become the core of Malaysia's foreign policy. Malaysia wants to avoid being dragged into the political arrangement of the big powers. Since its independence in 1957, Malaysia has established friendly relations with all countries. The United States under the Joe Biden administration has become more active in Southeast Asia. However, the US should refrain from continuing the policy of confrontation with China and expecting countries to choose either the US or China. Malaysia hopes the US will show leadership for common interests and prioritize multilateralism.\nThis year in the Chinese zodiac is a Year of the Dragon, a mystical animal often associated with China. While the tiger is a symbol of Malaysia, this year, we will witness close cooperation between the \"dragon and tiger\". Although diplomatic relations between Malaysia and China only started in 1974, in terms of history, Malaysia-China relations have been intertwined for hundreds of years. It should be emphasized that the history of Malaysia-China relations is one of friendship and mutual respect. Malaysia-China relations are win-win because both countries need each other. As the Chinese say, \"Gold is easy to get, but best friends are harder to find\".\n \nLink to Image\n \n \nLink to Image\nWANG XIAOYING/CHINA DAILY\n \n \nThe author is an associate professor and deputy executive director of the Asia-Europe Institute at the University of Malaya and a member of the Belt and Road Initiative Caucus for the Asia Pacific.

    "text": "\n 27 Feb 2024 (Philippines News Agency) President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. will participate in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-Australia Special Summit in Melbourne from March 4 to 6, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said Tuesday.\nMarcos will attend the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit upon the invitation of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, DFA Assistant Secretary for ASEAN Affairs Daniel Espiritu said in a pre-departure briefing with Palace reporters.\n'The summit presents an opportunity for us to present the Philippines' core position on regional and international issues and set the tone for dialogue partners' summit later in the year, especially in October,' Espiritu said.\nEspiritu said Marcos is expected to attend the Leaders' Plenary and the Leaders' Retreat, the two main engagements on the ASEAN-Australia Summit Proper on March 6.\nDuring his participation in the Leaders' Plenary, Marcos would take the opportunity to thank Australia for its unwavering support for the rule of law, the 1982 United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) ruling on the South China Sea (SCS).\n'The President may also highlight ASEAN-Australia cooperation on maricreated_at issues, climate and clean energy track, people-to-people exchange, and economic cooperation,' Espiritu said.\nEspiritu added that Marcos, during the Leaders' Retreat, is expected to encourage Australia to remain committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes, as well as to maintain respect for the rules-based international order and multilateralism, considering that these are 'currently very much under challenge'.\nDFA spokesperson Ma. Teresita Daza said the SCS issue will be raised, given that the Philippines has 'strong' defense and security relations with Australia.\n'In terms of what's happening in the region and what is happening within our region, one issue will be the South China Sea. And it's also worth mentioning that Australia and the Philippines are maricreated_at nations and it cannot be denied that it will be something that will have to be raised as well,' Daza said.\nOther engagements\nMarcos would also hold separate meetings with other world leaders, Australian business leaders, and the Filipino community in Melbourne on the sidelines of the ASEAN-Australian Special Summit, Espiritu said.\nEspiritu said Marcos is expected to have separate bilateral meetings with Cambodia and New Zealand. He, however, did not elaborate on the matter.\nMarcos, he said, would also deliver a keynote speech at the Lowy Institute on March 4 to highlight the Philippines' role as 'an active participant in world affairs and a contributor to the rules-based regional security architecture.'\nAlso on March 4, Marcos will meet with his fellow Filipinos at Melbourne's town hall.\nMarcos would also deliver remarks during the launch of the Victoria International Container Terminal, the first-fully automated container terminal of Australia, on March 5.\nEspiritu said there would also be a Philippine Business Forum in Melbourne to promote the country's business climate and entice more investments.\nMarcos' scheduled attendance to ASEAN-Australia Special Summit in Melbourne will be the second leg of his visit to Australia.\nHe will first visit Canberra on Feb. 28 to 29 to serve as 'guest of the Australian government' and address the Australian Parliament to discuss the vision for the Philippines and Australia's strategic partnership.\nDaza said Marcos will return to the Philippines after his visit to Canberra and will fly back to Australia for the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines should ensure ironclad security arrangements with its allies in case of a potential Trump presidency that could force the US to scale back its presence in the Indo-Pacific region despite China’s increased assertiveness, according to a geopolitical expert.\nWhile the US is unlikely to totally disengage from the region, it might scale back its presence, a move that could have serious implications for the Philippines and other small states that have a sea dispute with China, Enrico Cau, an associate researcher at the Taiwan Center for International Strategic Studies, said in a reply to questions sent via Facebook Messenger.\nChina, which claims the South China Sea almost in its entirety, might see decreased US presence in the region as an “implicit green light to pursue its territorial ambitions across the region unchallenged,” he said. “It may sow a wave of insecurity among smaller powers unable to build sufficient deterrence.”\nThis could create a leadership vacuum in a region that is averse to formal defense coalitions, he added.\nFormer US President Donald John Trump, who pushes for an America first policy, has moved closer to the Republican Party’s presidential nomination for the 2024 elections after defeating former Governor Nikki Haley in her home state, South Carolina, on Saturday.\nThe US presidential election is nine months away and countries are now preparing for the potential consequences of another Trump presidency, which could mean US abandonment of Ukraine and Taiwan and a transactional approach to foreign policy.\nA Trump presidency might keep the level of US engagement in the region “while devolving costs and responsibilities of regional security to regional partners,” Mr. Cau said.\nThe Philippines has taken its security alliance with the US to the next level amid an increasingly expansionist China. There is also increased tension between China and Taiwan, which it claims as its own territory.\nIn February last year, President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. gave Washington access to four more military bases on top of the five existing sites.\nThe Trump government through former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2019 vowed to defend the Philippines in case of an attack by China, a commitment that US President Joseph R. Biden has reiterated.\nMr. Pompeo during his visit to Manila in March 2019 said the Philippines, like other countries in the region, must do its part to keep the South China Sea free and open.\n“The only thing I know about Trump is that he’s against China,” Philippine Coast Guard spokesman Jay Tristan Tarriela told a forum last week. “Our alliance with the US will not be negated or affected by having Trump again in the White House.”\nUS VOID\nBoth Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden view China as a threat, said Joshua Bernard B. Espeña, vice president at Manila-based International Development and Security Cooperation. “What might differ is how Trump views unilateralism as the main approach against China,” he said via Messenger chat.\nUnder the Trump government, the US renamed its Pacific Command to the Indo-Pacific Command in recognition of the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific oceans, Mr. Espeña said.\nLast week, the US and Philippine military held the air component of their Maricreated_at Cooperative Activity’s third iteration that started this month. The two forces held their first joint patrols in November last year.\n“We can deduce that the alliance will still be fine at the operational level,” Mr. Espeña said. “It just so happened that Trump’s years coincided with ex-President Rodrigo R. Duterte’s tenure,” he added, noting that Mr. Marcos, whose family spent years in exile in the US, has “good personal relations with the American elite.”\nDon Mclain Gill, who teaches foreign relations at De La Salle University, said the US under another Trump presidency would likely want its allies in the region including the Philippines to assume more responsibility.\n“Under the previous Philippine administration, Manila often gave the cold shoulder to Washington,” he said via Messenger chat. “Manila will have to make sure that it does not get the shorter end of the bargain.”\nMr. Trump likes industrious allies, Mr. Espeña said. “I think that joint patrols and other relevant exchanges would proceed. Should Trump win the presidency, the Philippines should do what it always does: do more and contribute more to the alliance.”\nMr. Cau said Japan could fill the void in case the US scales back its commitment to the region.\n“This means that for the Philippines, tightening relations with Japan may be a good idea,” he said. “But there are always limitations. The country may get too involved in conflicts that it should avoid.”\nThe Philippines should continue cooperating with the US “while also preserving adequate red lines in terms of how far such cooperation should go,” Mr. Cau said, adding that it should accept the fact that US support might not last forever.\nThe Philippines should set up a network of defense partners to share costs and know-how in the defense sector, he added, citing the path taken by Japan, Indonesia and South Korea.\n"

    "text": "\n2024 FEB 27 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Engineering Daily News -- Investigators publish new report on electronics. According to news originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"In deep water, deploying a short vertical line array (VLA) is an effective way for source localization.\" \n Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China. \n Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Institute of Acoustics: \"In the past decade, most studies focused on localizing sources at the short to moderate ranges in the reliable acoustic path or the direct arrival zone (DAZ), with a VLA deployed near the ocean bottom. Little work has been done for the end part of the DAZ and the zones outside the DAZ. In addition, a VLA deployed at other depths rather than near the bottom is rarely studied. This paper proposes a near-surface source depth estimation method by matching the measured created_at delay with a library of modeled values under different source depths calculated by a simple formula. This method is suitable for zones, which contains two paths (one is reflected from the sea surface) with very close arrival angles, of a VLA deployed not only near the bottom, but also at other depths of the water column.\" \n According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Source depth estimation strategy for the end part of each zone, which faces the problem of poor depth resolution, is also analyzed. Simulation and experimental data of the airgun and explosive sources in the South China Sea are used to demonstrate the method.\" \n For more information on this research see: Depth estimation for broadband sources with a vertical line array in deep water.

Not so. Why?\nFirst, China, along with North Korea and Russia, are dictatorial led countries, interconnected by railways, seas, rivers, highways and airways. North Korea and Russia are heavily dependent upon China's products, goods and services.\nSecond, according to the International Monetary Fund, China makes up 19 percent of the world's economic output.\nThird, based on GDP purchasing power parity, China has the world's largest economy; the United States has fallen to third place.\nFourth, China's $8 trillion \"Belt and Road Initiative\" is a massive infrastructure project bringing together the economies of 76 countries from East Asia to Western Europe (60 percent of the world's population) to accommodate free trade.\nFifth, China has created a multinational development bank in cooperation with Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Australia.\nSixth, China is the largest contributor to international peacekeeping efforts within the United Nations Security Council.\nSeventh, over six years ago China launched their \"16+1\" free trade project with several southern and eastern European states.\nEighth, China is working with the International Monetary Fund to make the renminbi a reserve currency alongside the dollar.\nNinth, \"Made in China 2025\" is a massive strategic plan to increase Chinese made content of core materials to 70 percent by 2025, focusing on high-technology fields and becoming the major manufacturing power and a real existential threat to USA's technological leadership.\nTenth, China holds the largest amount ($1.18 trillion) of U.S. government bonds and public debt ($6.2 trillion).  If China ever unloaded even a part of their hoard of American debt, it would send U.S. interest rates sky high.\nEleventh, China is not flinching one iota with Trump's trade tariff edict.  Chinese officials are smart-tightening regulations and increasing inspections of the 430 U.S. businesses operating in China will make the climate less hospitable to the point that their CEOs will let Trump know his ill-advised trade tariff is greatly harming their profit-and-loss statement.\nFinally, and probably most telling of China's increasing international prowess, is they have undergone a rapid military modernization, as has Russia, and dramatically expanded their naval fleet, projected to surpass the U.S.'s capacity by 2030.  One-third of global maricreated_at trade flows past China, North Korea and Russia borders.  With China, North Korea and Russia maintaining power in the Pacific Ocean, East China Sea, South China Sea and Bering Sea, they, and not the USA, will be the more appealing partners for 195 countries to trade with one another and feel protected by China's Navy.\nChina, North Korea and Russia know they've got the United States over a barrel on multiple fronts.\nIt's abundantly clear the past two years of Trump's authoritarian-isolationist-nationalism strategy runs counter to U.S. policy we've benefited from since 1776 and real financial damage is growing for individuals, families, entrepreneurs, small business owners and corporations.\nDear fellow Americans:  The international relations research-rich and factual-laden tea leaves are abundantly clear.  It's high created_at we replace our failed spineless legislators, of every political persuasion, with bold and globally educated leaders who will quit fighting with one another, put people before party and wisely protect our economic prosperity, let alone our freedom.\n"

Carlos Sardiello, CSG-1 commander. \"During the past four months, we routinely flew and sailed anywhere international law allows to assure Americans, allies and partners of our commitment to bolstering regional security and stability in the Indo-Pacific. With the unwavering support of our families and friends, we were proud to sail and fly forward as a symbol and the promise of America's advantage at sea.\"\nThe strike group departed for the scheduled deployment from San Diego Oct. 12, 2023, to sail and maneuver across the U.S. 3rd and 7th Fleet areas of operations. While in 7th Fleet, CSG-1 participated in and supported numerous bilateral and multinational maricreated_at exercises in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\nThe strike group conducted routine port visits to the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Philippines and Hawaii. Individual ships in CSG-1 visited Australia, Japan, Guam, Saipan, and Palau.\n\"These port visits demonstrated U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific region and further enhanced relationships with the leaders and local populations,\" said Sardiello.\nIn total, the strike group supported U.S. relations with eight allied and partner nations through two Multi-Large Deck Events, Annual Exercise 2023, several bilateral, tri-lateral and multi-lateral maricreated_at exercises in the Philippine Sea and South China Sea. CSG-1 worked alongside Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Republic of Korea and Singapore to reaffirm their commitment to regional stability and security in the Indo-Pacific.\nFurthermore, CSG-1 integrated and operated seamlessly with the U.S. Joint Force conducting maricreated_at exercises with Naval Special Warfare operators, unmanned surface vessels, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and two multi-carrier operations with the Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan CSGs.\nIn 133 days underway, the ship's crew conducted 10 underway replenishments, logged more than 13,000 flight hours and over 6,000 sorties, sailed more than 36,000 nautical miles, and safely received over 12 million gallons of fuel with zero mishaps. The Vinson crew conducted 9,540 launch and recovery evolutions, 7,835 aircraft moves, 651 aircraft elevator moves, issued nearly 12 million gallons of fuel to aircraft, and transferred nearly 5,000 pallets of cargo and mail.\n\"I couldn't be more proud of our Sailors. They executed with precision and discipline while strengthening our relationships with allies and partners. They were superb naval ambassadors in foreign ports,\" said Capt. Matthew Thomas, Carl Vinson's commanding officer. \"These highly trained Sailors showed they are reliable, resilient, and ready to support and defend the American way of life every day.\"\nNotable key leader engagements and visits aboard Carl Vinson included Republic of Korea Minister of Defense, defense chiefs from Indonesia and Malaysia, Commander of Japan Maricreated_at Self-Defense Force, U.S. Ambassadors to Singapore and Indonesia, senior officers from the Armed Forces of the Philippines, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, among others.\nThe Carl Vinson strike group deployed with flagship USS Carl Vinson and embarked CSG-1 staff, Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2, Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 1 staff and the Ticonderoga class guided-missile cruiser USS Princeton (CG 59). DESRON-1 ships included Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Hopper (DDG 70), USS Kidd (DDG 100), USS Sterett (DDG 104), and USS William P.

Additionally, North Korea is rapidly advancing its missile and nuclear weapons development and has repeatedly launched missiles over Japanese territory in recent years, also destabilizing the Korean peninsula, neighboring the country of the rising sun.\nIn this context, ReporteAsia during its stay in Japan had the unique opportunity to interview Akiyama Nobumasa, professor at the School of Public and International Policy and the Faculty of Law at Hitotsubashi University, one of Japan's leading academics and one of the most prolific in terms of published writings on Defense and Denuclearization.\nThis renowned scholar is a member and senior associate member of APLN (Asia-Pacific Leadership Network for Nuclear Nonproliferation and Disarmament) and an adjunct research fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs. He also served as Minister Counselor at the Permanent Mission of Japan to the International Organizations in Vienna and was Special Advisor to the Ambassador on Nuclear Security from April 2016 to March 2018. He was also a member of the Public Security Review Commission of the Government of Japan, a member of the Panel of Eminent Persons for Substantive Advancement of Nuclear Disarmament and Advisor to the Japanese delegation to the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty) Review.\nWith him, we were able to analyze the geopolitical map of Japan in relation to Asia Pacific, gaining an in-depth understanding of issues that are not commonly debated in Latin America, and which, however, are fundamental to understand the consequences that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has generated, and the global impacts that this event is still causing.\nChina\nThe relationship between Japan and China can be traced in documented form to the 5th century AD, when they began to interact more fluidly, through missions that the incipient Japan sent to China to learn different knowledge, including architecture, governance, religion and language, since originally in the Japanese archipelago Chinese writing was used. Centuries later, the two countries continue to write a joint history in the East Asian region, but much water has flowed under the bridge, including more recent and unhappy, complex historical issues that take us back to World War II and the Japanese invasions of Chinese territory.\nAlong with China's economic growth, happening since the late 1970s of the last century, the strengthening of its military began to worry its neighbors. \"In fact, their tendency to expand their nuclear arsenal, if it only has to do with the threat from the United States as they claim, raises questions: why then did they develop medium- and short-range missiles that are to attack nearby targets such as Japan?\" asks Akiyama applying logic. \"We need more channels of communication between the two countries. If, as they say, the growth of their nuclear arsenal does not create any danger to their neighbors, they have to convince us through their behavior. That is the situation. We are looking for predictability in China's behavior.\"\n-Professor, is there a growing threat perception in Japan from China?\n-That's right, and we're getting to thinking about whether that's not just China's strategic objective. I have an example: the Japanese government recently decided to add the U.S.-made Tomahawk missile to its arsenal as a means of counterattack. It is striking that, if it had tried to push this purchase through 10 or 15 years ago, it would have come in for a lot of criticism. But now, on the other hand, he has gained a lot of public support. I think today the majority of the population agrees with Japan's introduction of counter-strike capabilities. The context is the growing threat perception from China: it happens now that the majority of the population shares that same feeling.\nNorth Korea\n-In your view, does North Korea pose a nuclear threat to Japan?\n-No, it would be a question of logic if it were to happen. But, nevertheless, their actions are dangerous: they are demonstrating their abilities by launching missiles that cross our territory, which means that they have that capability already very advanced. But their tests are more focused on showing capabilities to attack long distance targets, such as the United States. Likewise, they generally exhibit weaponry for large-scale conflicts as well as for regional use in the event of a crisis on the Korean peninsula. Of course, they know that their military strength is not comparable to that of South Korea, in addition to the presence that U.S. forces can achieve in that country. Therefore, the most effective way for them to try to catch up with their rivals was to have their own nuclear weapons. The problem with all this tactical nuclear weaponry at North Korea's disposal is that, in the event of an escalation of the war scenarios, it is much more likely to use these resources before other conventional resources in which, on the other hand, it does not have such an advantage. This is very dangerous.\nSouth Korea\n-If North Korea were to push to a higher level for the inclusion of nuclear weapons on some front of war, what would you see as South Korea's position?\n-There is much debate about what Donald Trump's attitude would be if he were to be elected for a second created_at. In his first term, he expressed serious intentions to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea. This imposes a strong sense of weakness on South Korea at the geopolitical level. Then, the fact that the U.S. may not be a long-term ally for South Korea poses that South Korea should stand up to North Korea on its own, and this also sets up serious threats in the whole region. South Korea's perception of China has also changed a lot in the last 5 to 6 years. Anti-Chinese sencreated_atnt is also growing there. It happens that China seeks to align South Korea to its policies by putting some trade pressure on it. This marks that it does not treat it as an equal, but directly seeks to subdue it through economic sanctions. As I commented recently, China's behavior is becoming less and less predictable in its policies. And I think also for South Korea, the rational decision would be to align itself with partners whose compartments give them some security and certainty, and I think that, primarily, that is the United States. North Korea's hostile attitude will not stop. Therefore, if South Korea were to need to counter that aggression, it is easy to think that it would seek to align itself more concretely with the United States and Japan. Indeed, in the event of an escalation of regional conflicts, it will be important for a more effective operation of U.S. forces on the Korean peninsula to use the military bases located in Japan. Therefore, it is essential for South Korea to rely on Japanese self-defense forces for its own protection.\n-How does the relationship of South Korea and Japan influence the regional geopolitical context?\n-Both countries used to have very bad relations, due to historical, territorial issues (Takeshima Island). It is true that the United States is also pushing for the relationship between Japan and South Korea to improve. It is important to balance China's power in the region. Of course, if China senses the divide between Japan and South Korea it will tend to intervene and manipulate. But if the relationship is good enough, China will have to deal with both countries as a coalition. Unfortunately, our relationship with South Korea is pendulum swinging. In Japan, it is said that when center-right governments are elected in South Korea, we tend to get along better. But this is not the case with Yoon Suk Yeol, whom I do not consider right-wing, however, but who has been strengthening the link with our country. He is a very interesting person, a former prosecutor, who analyzes everything from a reasonable legal point of view, and in that sense, he has achieved important rapprochements.\nRussia\n-What is Japan's perception of Russia and is it considered a direct military threat?\n-Our problem with Russia is not that Vladimir Putin is carrying out a direct attack against Japanese territory, although nuclear submarines are moving close to Japan, but what is more worrying is that North Korea and Russia are achieving an increasingly strong partnership. All indications are that North Korea is supplying Russia with missiles and weaponry in its war against Ukraine. And many wonder what North Korea is getting in return. In principle, it is understood that sophistication in its missile technology, cooperation in nuclear weaponry, materials. North Korea focuses mostly on WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) programs, such as missiles and nuclear weapons, and Russia deals with more conventional weaponry. Therefore, complementarity between them exists. In addition, Russia and China conduct joint military exercises in the vicinity of Japan, in international waters and also in disputed areas north of Hokkaido, or directly within territorial waters, where they also deploy their air forces. Of course, no country wants to go to war with China, it is not a concrete hypothesis, but neither do they want to see China engaging in assertive and coercive behavior. Peaceful coexistence and cooperation is in our interest, and that is why I think it is very valuable to have healthy relations with many countries in Asia Pacific.\n-Just one area where Japan has grown a lot in influence is Asia Pacific?\n-That's right. It is known that it was Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who introduced the Free and Open Indo-Pacific concept in 2016, which shows Japan's interest in the stability of the region. I believe that there today Japan has a reliable partner in Australia, which is also concerned that the region should not come under undue pressure from China. In fact, both countries are discussing possible military cooperation in the event of simultaneous contingencies in their respective regions of influence. This will tend to increase the sophistication and frequency of joint exercises between the SDF and the Australian military. This activity is in response to the Australia-Japan Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation signed by Prime Ministers Fumio Kishida and Anthony Albanese in October 2022. Also, Japan is now adding a lot of relations with the Philippines, which also has territorial disputes with China (Spratly and Paracel Islands, etc.), a country that has stated on several occasions that it will annex all its territories before 2049, including by military means. Therefore, in the Philippines the negative perception of China is growing, and also because of this the authorities of that country are seeking more contact with the United States, to counteract the influence of Beijing in that area. I could also say a lot about our relationship with India, which is very good. From a geopolitical perspective, I must also explain that we do not use this relationship as a tool against China: it is based on the fact that we share universal values and a thriving economic relationship. Often created_ats, our interests are at odds with each other: India buys fuel from Russia, we don't. But we understand that each country has its own needs, and we are willing to collaborate with them in other ways.\nMiddle East\n-Professor, the latest war conflicts are taking place in the Middle East, what is Japan's view of this situation?\n-I think with regard to the Middle East I must say that the Japanese government is more on the side of Israel, although the public is more sympathetic to the victims in Gaza. Japan is against terrorism and openly condemns it. But in Japan the fight against terrorism does not enable a humanitarian crisis like the one in Gaza. I think that creates internal contradictions. Likewise, other countries like Iran, which are very important for Japan because of their centrality in the area, and with which it has a relatively good relationship, represent certain challenges, because the Houthi rebels who attacked American and British ships in Yemen, and who are supported by Iran, also attacked Japanese ships. We want to help Palestine, but we have zero tolerance for Hamas and terrorism. Iran rightly supports regional conflicts and groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. That complicates us. At the same created_at, we don't want to see Iran becoming a nuclear power. Because if it does, Saudi Arabia will also become a nuclear player. And if that happens, there's going to be a nuclear escalation in the region. There, I think Japan has better ties with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are more aligned with the United States.\nUnited States\n-Do you see any difficulties ahead for Japan if it were Donald Trump to win the next presidential election?\n-In the past, the late Shinzo Abe handled the relationship with the United States very well, including in the Trump era. But because Trump has a transactional character, the relationship with Japan might not be so stable in certain terms. In fact, Trump at one point proposed a 6% tax on Japanese imports. If that happens, it would not be positive for the relationship, although the Joint Security policy should be maintained. At the same created_at, Japan announced that it will buy more steel from the United States, and that is fundamental for any American government, it is symbolic in the case of a key segment of its industry, and it will generate a lot of political support for Trump from certain segments of its population. Likewise, I do not rule out that Trump may exert some pressure on the Japanese. No economic irrationality would work in this relationship, though. Only if security were used as a tool to negotiate with Japan, in that case, we would face a crisis.\nDenuclearization\n-Finally, last year at the G7 summit PM Kishida presented the Hiroshima Action Plan. How do you think this initiative contributes to the denuclearization process?\n-In principle, I think it was well created_atd, because it came just when Russia reminded us of the usefulness of nuclear weapons. In this plan, it sets out 5 pillars to advance denuclearization: continuing not to use nuclear weapons; improving the transparency of nuclear capabilities; maintaining the downward trend of the global nuclear arsenal; ensuring nuclear non-proliferation and promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy; and encouraging international leaders and others to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I think it was courageous for the cause. Likewise, there was no major breakthrough for denuclearization advocates. Because, we have to face a reality: we have to manage the hypothetical of an imminent nuclear threat as long as nuclear weapons exist. China is expanding in nuclear weapons, North Korea is following, can we close our eyes? In Japan we have to show - not at the nuclear level, but at the conventional level - that we are prepared to handle their threats and that no country is prepared to achieve its objectives by the use of force. We have to convince them that only diplomacy and international relations are the way to achieve geopolitical objectives. If China sees an increasingly strong U.S. relationship with Japan and they envision this trend expanding to South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Malaysia, if this happens it would change the environment for strategic dialogue with Japan and much better if also the role of nuclear weapons diminishes and ceases to be a space of threat.\nNote originally published in Reporte Asia\n"

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. arrived in Australia on Wednesday for a two-day official visit where he plans to solidify security arrangements linked to concern about the reported presence of Chinese warships near traditional South China Sea fishing grounds.\nBefore departing for Canberra from the Villamor Air Base near Manila, Marcos shared a report by the Philippine Coast Guard indicating that crews had monitored at least three ships from China's People's Liberation Army Navy about 20 nautical miles from Bajo de Masinloc, the local name for Scarborough Shoal.\n\"It's worrisome because there are two elements to that. One, is that before it's only the Chinese Coast Guard were seen there. Now, there's already the navy,\" Marcos told reporters.\nMarcos stressed that \"the basic principle there is that the fishers must be allowed to fish in their traditional fishing grounds, which belong in the maricreated_at territory of the Philippines.\"\nThe government, he said, would \"continue to support all of our fishermen, fisher folks who make their living from these fishing grounds.\"\nA recent report by the Philippine Coast Guard indicated that China was deploying its naval ships near the shoal to support its coast guard, Marcos said.\nIn Beijing, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mao Ning said China's position on the South China Sea was consistent.\n\"We express grave concern over the Philippines' recent activities in the South China Sea that infringe on China's sovereignty and will continue to take necessary measures to firmly safeguard our territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests, and keep the South China Sea peaceful and stable,\" she told reporters on Wednesday.\nAddress to lawmakers\nWhile in Canberra, Marcos was expected to raise concerns about the South China Sea during an address to the Australian Parliament.\n\"I anticipate an enhancement of the mutual understanding between the Philippines and Australia as we share a common vision not just for our bilateral relations, but for the peace and security of the region as well,\" Marcos said before boarding his flight to Australia.\nThe president said that it was \"worth mentioning that Australia and the Philippines are maricreated_at nations and it cannot be denied that it will be something that will have to be raised as well.\"\nDuring a visit to Manila in September, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reaffirmed Canberra's support for Manila's South China Sea claims and improved defense ties.\nAlbanese and Marcos then signed a \"Joint Declaration on Strategic Partnership.\" It upgrades the bilateral partnership to include possible joint patrols in the South China Sea as well as more and larger joint exercises between Philippine and Australian forces.\nMarcos said the strategic partnership between the Philippines and Australia \"provides greater energy and optimism for closer cooperation that is mutually beneficial to both Filipinos and Australians.\"\nA China Coast Guard boat shadows a Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources inflatable boat while it delivers supplies to fishermen during a mission near the China-controlled Scarborough Shoal in the disputed South China Sea, Feb. 22, 2024. (AFP/Philippine Coast Guard handout)\nThe Chinese have been in control of Scarborough Shoal since 2012 after a standoff with the Philippines.\nThe following year, then-President Benigno Aquino III filed a case against Beijing in an international arbitration court. In 2016, the court ruled in favor of Manila and invalidated China's sweeping claims to the South China Sea on historical grounds. Beijing has never acknowledged the ruling and has refused to leave the area.\nAquino's successor, Rodrigo Duterte, refused to make a move to compel Beijing. Instead, he sought to appease Beijing in exchange for promises of Chinese investments in the Philippines. This allowed Beijing to gain a firmer foothold in the region.\nMarcos, who succeeded Duterte in 2022, has worked to repair defense ties with the United States.\nIn Washington on Wednesday, the Philippine ambassador to the United States said he did not expect Washington to change its strategy in the region should Donald Trump win a second term as president, after having contact with one of Trump's advisers, Reuters news service reported.\n\"That is of course very consoling,\" Jose Manuel Romualdez told a diplomatic gathering in the U.S. capital, according to Reuters. He noted that while a potential Taiwan conflict should be taken seriously, the \"real flashpoint is the West Philippine Sea,\" using Manila's name for its South China Sea territories.\nIn Masinloc, a Philippine fishing community on Luzon island's west coast overlooking the South China Sea and that has been affected by the Chinese control of the shoal, fishermen rejoiced that Marcos' government appeared to have responded to their plight.\nStill, a group of fishermen called Pamalakaya, which has members in Masinloc, said that while the government's recent moves in Scarborough were welcome, much more needed to be done. They said that the China Coast Guard has been allowing Chinese fishermen to harvest giant clams while destroying the reef.\n\"The catch has dwindled a lot,\" said Leonardo Cuaresma, one of the leaders of Pamalakaya in Masinloc, adding that many local fishermen who tried to return to the shoal have been chased away.\nHe said that he hoped that Marcos would be successful in \"ending the bullying of the Chinese and for them to leave Scarborough.\"\nAnother fisherman, Bobby Roldan, said there was \"strong evidence\" and testimonies by Filipino fishermen about China's illegal activities on the shoal. He said Marcos' position remains weak because he could not stop China from \"continuing to take the West Philippine Sea.\"\nJason Gutierrez and Jojo Rioza in Masinloc, Philippines, along with Jeoffrey Maitem in Puerto Princesa, Philippines, contributed to this report.\nBenarNews is an RFA-affiliated news service.\n"

    "text": "\nFeb. 28—TOKYO( The Japan News/ANN) — Chinese ships continue to appear in Indonesia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around the Natuna Islands in the northern part of the country in the South China Sea, where China is continuing its maricreated_at expansion. Indonesian Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, who appears set to become the next president, has called for the strengthening of national defense capabilities. However, balancing relationships with China, an important economic partner, is likely to be an issue.\nNatuna Besar, the largest of the Natuna Islands, is home to a surveillance base of Indonesia's Maricreated_at Security Agency, which is the equivalent of the Japan Coast Guard. Using surveillance cameras and other equipment, the agency is on 24-hour alert for illegal operations in the surrounding waters.\nIlham, the head of the base, stood in front of a monitor showing information on vessels sailing in the area during an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun on Jan. 31. \"The situation with Chinese vessels has not changed in recent years,\" Ilham, 43, said. Regarding an area in the South China Sea where China makes vast unilateral territorial claims, he stressed, \"We don't recognize it.\"\nIn the surrounding EEZ, the presence of Chinese vessels, including those of the China Coast Guard, was confirmed eight created_ats from January to September last year. Chinese vessels have been seen with similar frequency in the past few years.\nThe island's main industry is fishing, and local residents are wary of the Chinese vessels. In 2022, a China Coast Guard vessel approached a local fisherman's boat and told him to leave the area after showing him a map.\n\"We can't compete as we are on a small wooden boat. The government should increase its vigilance activities,\" the 37-year-old fisherman said.\nThe administration of President Joko Widodo, who took office in 2014, has been nervous about China's moves and named the waters around the Natuna Islands as the North Natuna Sea in 2017. Joko visited the island in 2020.\nIn an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun in December 2023, Joko said, without naming China, \"Respect for international law is important as the key to peace and stability in the South China Sea.\"\nThe Indonesian military conducted its largest-ever exercise with the U.S. military in 2022. Last year, Indonesia received patrol vessels from Japan to counter illegal fishing, and the two nations are strengthening cooperation between their coast guard authorities, as well.\nPrabowo, who positioned himself in this month's presidential election as the candidate to provide continuity as a successor to the Joko administration, has announced a policy of increasing the military presence in remote islands and border areas, and is expected to deepen cooperation with Japan and the United States.\nHowever, Indonesia's economic ties with China — its largest trading partner — are extremely deep. Chinese investment will be indispensable in developing the country's abundant natural resources, such as nickel, and in promoting plans to relocate the capital.\nAfter his presumptive election victory was reported on Feb. 18, Prabowo greeted China's ambassador to Indonesia, who came to congratulate Prabowo at his home. After taking office in October, he is likely to face delicate decisions on security and trade policies.\n___ (c)2024 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

    "text": "\nA Chinese vessel's latest patrol of Malaysian waters has highlighted the country's low profile approach to such intrusionsA 'noisier' approach could hurt its trade and economic interests, and cause 'unbridled escalation' in the disputed sea, analysts say\nMalaysia's low-key response to Chinese coastguard patrols of its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) signals an interest in maintaining economic ties with Beijing and a desire not to \"politicise or unilaterally alter the status quo in the region\", analysts have said. \nThey added that Malaysia had upgraded security ties and diversified foreign investment to reduce its economic dependence on China. \nOne expert noted there were indications Beijing was using cyber espionage to support its so-called grey zone operations in the South China Sea, including to prevent Malaysia from developing its gas fields. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nWhile China and the Philippines have been caught in multiple skirmishes in the South China Sea, similar patrols by Chinese vessels in Malaysia's EEZ have prompted only muted official responses from Putrajaya, also a claimant in the disputed waterway. \nOn February 17, the China Coast Guard 5403 vessel sailed off the coast of Malaysia to begin a period of intrusive patrolling into the country's oil and gas fields, according to SeaLight, a Stanford University project focused on grey zone activities in the South China Sea. The patrol is still ongoing. \nNgeow Chow-Bing, director of the Institute of China Studies at the University of Malaya, said Malaysia had maintained a low profile approach to China's maricreated_at intrusions for more than a decade, preferring to register its protests through diplomatic channels while sending out navy and coastguard vessels to keep an eye on the Chinese boats. \n\"This is the standard approach and will remain so unless the status quo is disrupted,\" Ngeow said, adding that a \"noisier\" approach was unnecessary and could even be counterproductive. \nWhile Malaysia's trade and economic ties with China were important, Ngeow said the country also derived benefits from having a stable and positive relationship with Beijing while carefully managing their differences. \nIn a rare instance of vocal opposition, Malaysia publicly spoke out against China's latest map last August that laid claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, including areas off the coast of Malaysian Borneo. \n\"However, it is felt that there is no need to dwell on this map after the official position has been clearly stated,\" Ngeow said. \nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, on a visit to China last September, said Beijing had assured him it would continue to negotiate with Southeast Asian nations over disputed territorial claims in the resource-rich waterway, and avoid actions that risked escalation. \nBrian Wong, assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Hong Kong, and an adviser on strategy for the Oxford Global Society think tank, said while Malaysia firmly viewed the South China Sea as a core part of its security interests, it was wary of any overt attempt to politicise or unilaterally alter the status quo in the region. \n\"The uneasy equilibrium is one that Putrajaya is keen to maintain,\" he said, adding that the incumbent administration \"does not believe direct confrontation and unbridled escalation over the region is conducive towards its geopolitical interests\". \nWong said Putrajaya was engaging in \"delicate expectation management\" as it sought to ensure continued economic and trade connectivity with China, while also positioning itself as a \"more strategically non-aligned but economically friendly partner\", especially to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative in the region. \n\"[Malaysia is] trying to nudge China, through more amiable calls, onto a multilateralist path for resolution of territorial disputes,\" he added. \nChina has been Malaysia's largest trading partner since 2009, with total trade between both nations reaching a record US$203.6 billion in 2022, according to Chinese official figures. \nIn 2022, Malaysia exports of palm oil and related products to China amounted to US$3.72 billion, accounting for 11.4 per cent of the country's total worldwide exports of these products. \nLast May, China said it would invest an estimated US$38.64 billion in Malaysia, including in the petrochemical and automotive industries, while Chinese carmaker Geely in July announced a US$10 billion plan to develop Malaysia's auto-making hub. \nPrashanth Parameswaran, fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington DC and founder of the weekly Asean Wonk newsletter, said Malaysia \"may not be as loud as the Philippines\" in its public remarks, but China's maricreated_at assertiveness continued to be a concern for the country. \nKeenly aware of its economic dependence on China, Parameswaran said Malaysia had over the past year pushed for more diversified foreign investment and upgrading of security ties with partners like Japan. \nIn December, Japan and Malaysia signed a security assistance deal that would include a US$2.8 million grant to boost Malaysia's maricreated_at security, and the provision of rescue boats and supplies. \n\"Anwar's government will be keenly aware of the need to avoid the perception he is overly soft on the South China Sea issue,\" Parameswaran said, noting he had faced scrutiny by the opposition into his dealings with Beijing when he returned from China last April. \nRay Powell, director of SeaLight, the Stanford University project focused on grey-zone activities in the South China Sea, said Malaysia had adopted a restrained approach towards China's \"continuous intrusive patrols\" of its offshore oil and gas fields, which were clearly on Malaysia's continental shelf within its lawful EEZ. \n\"While this keeps its maricreated_at dispute manageable, it also meets China's intent to normalise its 'right' to operate there and assert its jurisdiction,\" he said. \"Beijing's grey-zone strategy relies on its neighbours' appearance of acquiescence so that it can gradually increase its presence and ultimately consolidate its control throughout its expansive maricreated_at claims.\" \nGaute Friis, a defence innovation scholar at Stanford's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, said there were indications Beijing was using cyber espionage to support its kinetic grey zone operations in the South China Sea, including to prevent Malaysia from developing its subsea gas fields. \n\"We all know that China relentlessly hacks its Southeast Asian neighbours,\" Friis said, pointing to recent evidence suggesting some of these cyber operations were aimed at gathering information that China's coastguard used in its operations to harass offshore energy companies in Kasawari. \nDeveloped by Malaysian oil and gas company Petronas, the Kasawari gas development project is located off Sarawak in the South China Sea. \nFriis said researchers at the cybersecurity vendor Proofpoint claimed \"with moderate confidence\" that hackers operating on behalf of the Hainan branch of the Chinese Ministry of State Security targeted \"companies that appear to be involved in either the engineering, extraction of natural gases, or export of natural gas products from the Kasawari gas project\" during the same period when the Chinese Coast Guard was engaging in a harassment campaign against vessels working on Malaysian oil and gas development off the coast of Sarawak. \n\"Essentially, it seems these kinds of cyber operations enable the China Coast Guard to calibrate its harassment operations to achieve maximal disruption to Malaysia's oil and gas development within Malaysia's own EEZ.\" \n\"It is a rare example of Chinese cyber espionage enabling kinetic operations,\" Friis said. \nCopyright (c) 2024.

    "text": "\nThe Philippines is exploring for oil and gas in areas other than the South China Sea due to a territorial dispute with China. The Philippines is considering the Sulu Sea area as a new exploration hot spot, with companies now involved. The dispute with China has stalled developments in the Reed Bank area, which hosts a stalled Philippine natural gas project. The long-running dispute in the South China Sea involves territorial claims by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei, and Malaysia. China has territorial claims to about 90% of the South China Sea, which puts it at odds with its neighbors. In 2016, a court in The Hague ruled against China's claims and in favor of the Philippines, stating that the Philippines had sovereign rights in its 200-mile exclusive economic zone to access offshore oil and gas resources, including in the Reed Bank. However, China has not acknowledged the ruling, escalating tensions in the area. With exploration in the South China Sea on hold, the Philippines contracted Ratsio Gibraltar, a unit of Israeli firm Ratio Petroleum, to conduct a seismic survey in the SC76 area. Ratio Petroleum plans to send a vessel there next month to collect 3D seismic data.\n"

    "text": "\nThe record of the law enforcement actions taken by the China Coast Guard so far this year shows that two-fourths of them have been in response to provocations by the Philippines.\nIn February alone, the CCG released at least five notices or statements on measures that it had been forced to take because of the Philippines' provocative activities around Chinese islands and reefs in the South China Sea, namely Huangyan Island and Ren'ai Reef.\nTaking advantage of the restraint China has shown, the Philippines has sent its coast guard ships, government vessels and fishing boats to repeatedly trespass into waters adjacent to Huangyan Island. It has also repeatedly and with increasing frequency attempted to send building materials to reinforce the disintegrating warship it illegally grounded on China's Ren'ai Reef in 1999.\nNo country would sit idle in the face of such blatant provocations and infringements on its territorial integrity.\nThe Foreign Ministry's confirmation that China has recently reinstalled a barrier at the mouth of Huangyan Island in the South China Sea should drive home the message that China has both the resolve and the capability to counter the provocative intrusions by the Philippines.\nIn response to a related question on Monday, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said China was compelled to take such measures to firmly safeguard its sovereignty, territorial integrity and maricreated_at rights, and that Manila bears all the blame for the latest escalation of tensions, which is the outcome of its imprudent bravado.\nIt is no secret that much of the Philippines' newly found brio stems from the support of the United States, which is seeking to use the maricreated_at disputes between the Philippines and China to advance its own strategic goals in the region.\nIt is at the incitement of Washington that Manila has recklessly upped the ante with its antics in the South China Sea since last year.\nHence, the latest measure taken by China near Huangyan Island is fully justified and necessary.\nManila should recognize it is a clear warning that it should stop playing with fire.\nBoth Manila and Washington should not be lulled into the false sense of security that their games are without risks. They are rashly raising the stakes by continuously ratcheting up tensions in the South China Sea. Both would suffer consequences from a head-on clash with China, no matter what the scale.\nBack in 2012, Manila did not gain any advantage from unilaterally stoking tensions on Huangyan Island, which led to a standoff with China in the waters that lasted for weeks.\nIt will also fail to benefit from its doubled-down roguery this created_at. It will pay a dear price if it continues to bet on the US' aggressive wagering in the South China Sea for its brinkmanship with China.\n \n"

    "text": "\nSignal jamming affecting Philippine shipping in China-claimed waters amounts to \"electronic warfare\", a navy spokesman has claimed.\nThe disputed zone of what Manila calls the West Philippine Sea lies in an area of the energy-rich South China Sea within the U.S. defense treaty ally's internationally recognized exclusive economic zone.\nThe Southeast Asian country's coast guard said there have been \"instances\" over the past month when the automatic identification signals (AIS) of its ships and those of the Philippine fisheries bureau were jammed, temporarily preventing them from broadcasting their position.\n\"I would say probably—I'm not an IT expert—but this could already be a form of electronic warfare,\" Commodore Vincent Trinidad, spokesperson for the Philippines Navy's West Philippine Sea command, told local media Wednesday.\nThese latest incidents occurred while the coast guard ships were patrolling the disputed waters in support of fishermen close to the submerged reef, Second Thomas Shoal. The Chinese coast guard often expels Philippine boats from the traditional fishing ground, which lies about 120 nautical miles from the nearest Philippine province and nearly 600 from Chinese shores.\n\"The electronic interference affecting Filipino ships in the West Philippine Sea is worrisome,\" Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told reporters Wednesday, adding that his coast guards would not be deterred.\n\"We will continue to do it because that is our job. Our job is to help the fishermen who have been fishing there for a long created_at, several generations,\" he said.\nTrinidad told Newsweek in a phone call that navy crews had been reporting the alleged jamming for at least three to four years and that typically occurs as the navy rotates its ships in contested waters. \"It's become like a normal thing, you know,\" he said.\nHe pointed out the navy has back-up systems in place that mitigate the safety risk of momentary AIS lapses.\nTrinidad said he was not prepared to call out China as the source for the disruption \"without having the forensic proof.\"\nResponding to Philippine concern over the Chinese navy and coast guard presence at Scarborough Shoal, a barren rock about 120 miles west of the island of Luzon, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said: \"We express grave concern over the Philippines' recent activities in the South China Sea that infringe on China's sovereignty and will continue to take necessary measures to firmly safeguard our territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests and keep the South China Sea peaceful and stable.\"\nChina claims sovereignty over the atoll, like most of the sea, as its territory, citing unspecified historical rights.

However, balancing relationships with China, an important economic partner, is likely to be an issue.\nNatuna Besar, the largest of the Natuna Islands, is home to a surveillance base of Indonesia's Maricreated_at Security Agency, which is the equivalent of the Japan Coast Guard. Using surveillance cameras and other equipment, the agency is on 24-hour alert for illegal operations in the surrounding waters.\nIlham, the head of the base, stood in front of a monitor showing information on vessels sailing in the area during an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun on Jan. 31. \"The situation with Chinese vessels has not changed in recent years,\" said Ilham, 43. Regarding an area in the South China Sea where China makes vast unilateral territorial claims, he stressed, \"We don't recognize it.\"\nIn the surrounding EEZ, the presence of Chinese vessels, including those of the China Coast Guard, was confirmed eight created_ats from January to September last year. Chinese vessels have been seen with similar frequency in the past few years.\nThe island's main industry is fishing, and local residents are wary of the Chinese vessels. In 2022, a China Coast Guard vessel approached a local fisherman's boat and told him to leave the area after showing him a map.\n\"We can't compete as we're on a small wooden boat. The government should increase its vigilance,\" the 37-year-old fisherman said.\nThe administration of President Joko Widodo, who took office in 2014, has been nervous about China's moves and named the waters around the Natuna Islands the North Natuna Sea in 2017. Joko visited the island in 2020.\nIn an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun in December 2023, Joko said, without naming China, \"Respect for international law is important as the key to peace and stability in the South China Sea.\" The Indonesian military conducted its largest-ever exercise with the U.S. military in 2022. Last year, Indonesia received patrol vessels from Japan to counter illegal fishing, and the two nations are strengthening cooperation between their coast guard authorities, as well.\nPrabowo, who positioned himself in this month's presidential election as the candidate to provide continuity as a successor to the Joko administration, has announced a policy of increasing the military presence in remote islands and border areas, and is expected to deepen cooperation with Japan and the United States.\n"

    "text": "\nIn 2012, when Chinese marine surveillance vessels pushed the Philippine navy out of disputed waters in the South China Sea, Beijing learned it was possible to assert its sweeping territorial claims under the cover of enforcing domestic laws, without the help of its military.\nThe following year, China merged five civil maricreated_at agencies into the unified Chinese coast guard. Since 2018, it has been under the command of the paramilitary People's Armed Police, which is itself controlled by the Central Military Commission chaired by Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\nChina's tactical success at Scarborough Shoal—which it effectively controls but is still is at the heart of more recent tension between Beijing and Manila—\"might have been the key milestone,\" said Collin Koh, a maricreated_at security expert with the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University.\nThe rise of the Chinese coast guard, which operates several converted People's Liberation Army ships, freed up the Chinese navy to focus on deterrence and warfighting, Koh told Newsweek. The agency also has its own distinct ship classes, which can be \"up-armed in warcreated_at,\" a design choice also practiced by other nations including the United States.\nIn a December visit to Shanghai, China's president doubled down on his expectations for his country's powerful law enforcement agency, ordering coast guard personnel to \"resolutely defend China's territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests.\"\nNeighboring Japan, a U.S. security treaty ally, has expressed unease about the increased powers of the Chinese coast guard, which has ramped up its patrols at the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands, which Beijing claims as its own.\nTokyo is particularly concerned about \"problematic provisions\" granted under the Coast Guard Law enacted in February 2021, which it said were ambiguous as to the agency's geographical purview as well as its use of weapons.\nThe Chinese coast guard has no publicly available contact information. The Defense Ministry did not answer calls seeking comment.\nChina's coast guard vessels may be painted white, but they operate in what has been called the \"gray zone,\" embarking on coercive activities that deliberately stop short of war. The agency's enforcement of declared national boundaries—as close as 6 miles and as far as 600 miles from the Chinese coast—poses unique policy challenges for U.S. allies and partners in Asia.\nAcross the region, smaller nations with limited resources often must choose between funding its navy or its coast guard. In many cases, it is not uncommon for the former service to do the job of the latter.\nChina, meanwhile, has leaned on the financial means and the industrial capacity to raise a coast guard that now rivals most navies. Its Zhaotou-class patrol vessel—the world's biggest armed coast guard cutter—is larger than the U.S. Navy's Arleigh Burke-class destroyer.\nIn the South China Sea, long-running territorial disputes between Beijing and half a dozen other capitals are coming to a head as Manila fights for access to traditional fishing grounds in its exclusive economic zone. The U.S. is treaty-bound to defend the Philippines against an \"armed attack\" in the waters, but the Chinese coast guard is unlikely to cross that threshold.\nCoast guards are traditionally considered less threatening than their gray-hulled navy counterparts, which tend to be more heavily armed. But China is challenging that premise, observers say.\n\"The coast guard gives the Chinese a certain narrative that they can promote—that by using the coast guard while other parties deploy their navies, China is the one that is promoting peace and stability and avoiding escalation,\" Koh said.\n\"It has become the leading agency to spearhead China's maricreated_at sovereignty and rights assertion. Some would argue that the use of the coast guard emboldens the Chinese to do more,\" he said.\nLast week, China's nationalist Global created_ats newspaper said the country's coast guard played \"a special role\" in the country's territorial disputes.\nBy sending coast guard ships, Beijing showed that \"the essence of the South China Sea issue for China is about territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at delimitation, and China's measures are not about geopolitics or military confrontation,\" it quoted one expert as saying.\nIn the Taiwan Strait this month, the Chinese coast guard fleet began patrolling once restricted waters around the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen islands, just off China's shores, further eroding Taipei's authority and posing a fresh dilemma for the Taiwanese government.\nTaiwan repeated this week that its armed forces would not intervene so both sides of the strait could \"avoid war.\" The desire to deescalate and for proportionality means Taiwan's coast guard has the unenviable task of trying to keep China's much larger ships out of its waters.\nIn one striking image over the weekend, a Taiwan coast guard patrol boat was seen sailing alongside a 2,250-ton China coast guard vessel as it probed the waters around Kinmen. The Chinese ship was a former PLA Navy frigate of the Jiangwei class, according to Koh, the same type spotted off the Senkakus in the East China Sea.\nChina claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has refused to rule out the use of force to achieve its goal of unification. The U.S., Taipei's decades-long security partner, is urging Beijing to exercise restraint around Kinmen, but Washington has not publicly articulated how it might assist Taiwan in the latest round of tensions.\n\"There are no easy answers [to gray zone warfare]. China has dedicated enormous resources to making itself into the world's premier maricreated_at power by most measures,\" said Tom Shugart, a senior analyst with the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.\n\"They are now the world's largest shipbuilders, shipowners and trading nation. They have the world's largest fishing fleet by far, the world's largest coast guard, and the world's largest navy by a number of ships, if not by tonnage,\" Shugart told Newsweek.\n\"The only way to deal with that is to band together; we have to have tight alliances. Like-minded nations have to work together closely and pool their resources to come close to matching that,\" he said.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nChina Coast Guard Confronts Philippine Fishermen\nTED ALJIBE/AFP via Getty Images\nThis photo taken on February 16 shows a Philippine fisherman, front, sailing past a Chinese coast guard ship near China-controlled Scarborough Shoal in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.\n"

The discharge is expected to last until March 17 and reach nearly 7,800 tonnes. What's China's comment?\nMao Ning: Despite international concern and opposition, Japan has dumped over 23,000 tonnes of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, spreading the risk of contamination worldwide. This is against the international law and a seriously irresponsible move. China firmly opposes it and asks Japan to stop this wrongdoing.\nRecent incidents at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station where nuclear-contaminated water was splashed onto workers and leaked from the purification system spotlight TEPCO's management deficiency and inadequate government oversight. Japan's claim that the discharge is \"safe\" and \"reliable\" is not convincing.\nThe ocean discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water impacts the health of all humanity, the global marine environment and the international public interest. Japan needs to take seriously domestic and international concerns and handle the discharge properly with a responsible and constructive attitude. China urges Japan to provide full cooperation in setting up an independent international monitoring arrangement that remains effective in the long haul and has the substantive participation of Japan's neighboring countries and other stakeholders, so as to avoid irrevocable consequences stemming from the ocean discharge.\nGlobal created_ats: You just announced that Special Representative Li Hui will carry out the second round of shuttle diplomacy on seeking a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Could you explain the timing for the action? What's China's expectation for Li Hui's trip?\nMao Ning: It has been two years since the full escalation of the Ukraine crisis began. As the conflict drags on, the most urgent priority now is to restore peace. The sooner peace talks begin, the less the damage that is done.\nIn the past two years, China has never given up on promoting peace or slackened its efforts to facilitate talks. We had in-depth exchanges with countries including Russia and Ukraine, playing a constructive role in addressing the crisis. China also published its position paper on the political settlement of the crisis, and its special envoy traveled intensively to mediate among different parties. China has not sat idly by or added fuel to the flame, still less profiteered from the conflict. Behind all this, there is only one goal that China hopes to achieve, that is, to build consensus for ending the conflict and pave the way for peace talks. China will continue to play its role, carry out shuttle diplomacy, pool consensus and contribute China's wisdom for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.\nAFP: The world reacted to French President Emmanuel Macron's statement this week that the possibility of sending Western troops to Ukraine is not ruled out. The White House spokesperson said yesterday that the US will not send troops to Ukraine. What's the Foreign Ministry's comment on Macron's statement? \nMao Ning: China's position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We call on all sides to build consensus and accumulate conditions for deescalation and ceasefire. China will continue to play a constructive role for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.\nAFP: It's reported that the Filipino President said today that the presence of China's Navy and China Coast Guard vessels at Huangyan Dao is \"worrisome\". What's your comment?\nMao Ning: China's position on the South China Sea is consistent and clear. We express grave concern over the Philippines' recent activities in the South China Sea that infringe on China's sovereignty and will continue to take necessary measures to firmly safeguard our territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests, and keep the South China Sea peaceful and stable.\n"

    "text": "\nSabotage Beijing's goodwill\nThe Philippines has frequently advocated for the livelihood of the fisherfolks since 2023. \nAccording to Jay Tarriela, the spokesperson of the Philippine Coast Guard, the Philippines has sent governmental vessels to \"ensure the security of Filipino fishermen.\" \n\"Fishing activities have never been interfered with since 2016 when China offered the provisional arrangement for the Philippines' fisherfolks, while it now it has become a problem as the Philippines has decided to protect them by sending government vessels to invade the territory of Huangyan Dao,\" Lei Xiaolu, professor of law at the China Institute of Boundary and Ocean Studies, Wuhan University, told the Global created_ats.\nAs we all know, there is a territorial sovereignty dispute over Huangyan Dao between China and the Philippines. Although China neither accepts nor recognizes the South China Sea Arbitration, in 2016, China made a special arrangement for the Philippines' fishermen to maintain their small-scale artisanal fishing activities around Huangyan Dao under humanitarian considerations. \nFrom 2016 to 2023, China has always kept the commitment. Despite the territorial and maricreated_at disputes between the two sides, the livelihood of the fisherfolks has never been affected, Lei noted. \n\"This represents China's goodwill to maintain the peace and stability of the region, as well as to promote the development and prosperity of all people,\" Lei stressed.\nHowever, the status quo has been changed since the Philippines began to send government vessels to the territorial sea of Huangyan Dao in the second half of 2023. In this case, China had to respond and repel the government vessels. \nHowever, since 2024, the Philippines has conducted more and more provocations. The Philippine fishery vessel group was reportedly accompanied by the Ship 3002 which belongs to the Philippines' Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources when they trespassed waters off Huangyan Dao, and according to a statement by Gan Yu, a spokesperson at the China Coast Guard (CCG), the CCG repelled this particular ship in accordance with the law when it ignored repeated warnings from the Chinese side and insisted on illegally intruding into waters adjacent to Huangyan Dao from Febraury 24 to 25.\n\"Even so, China has shown great restraint. It did not name the specific activities of the fishermen in the CCG statement. The CCG only repelled the Philippines' government vessel 'illegally intruding.' It is clear that China has expressed its goodwill to the fisherfolks while defending its sovereignty,\" Lei said.\nBut increased evidence shows that those civilian fishing vessels are organized, sponsored, or even controlled and authorized by the Philippine government, according to the expert. \n\"It is not appropriate to use the livelihood of the fishermen as an excuse to satisfy the ambitions of certain politicians. If the Philippines was thinking of the livelihood of the fisherfolks, it would return to the 'gentlemen's arrangement' with China, rather than leading to the aggravation of the situation,\" Lei said.\nHiring fishermen to cause trouble in specific waters, then sending government ships to regularly supply them with fuel, and then turning around to accuse China of conducting law enforcement activities on the scene, the Philippines has staged another ugly farce at Huangyan Dao, similar to how they grounded their warship on Ren'ai Jiao, Yang suggested.\nAll of these conspiracies were made possible because China's goodwill and restraint were abused by the Philippines. This evil act of disregarding commitments has greatly harmed the security and development of the South China Sea region, Yang said.\n"

Jay Tarriela said during its last mission in the area, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) spotted three People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy warships near Bajo de Masinloc.\nThe warships, however, maintained a distance of more than 20 nautical miles from the shoal, he said.\n\"It is important for us to note that within ... the 12 nautical miles, we have territorial sovereignty over these waters,\" Tarriela said during a press briefing. \"So these Chinese warships have always maintained that they are outside the 12 nautical miles.\"\nAt the same created_at, the BFAR vessel monitored the presence of a Chinese Navy helicopter flying over the waters of Bajo de Masinloc.\n\"What the BFAR ship and other Filipino fishing vessels do is they try to determine where the helicopter took off,\" Tarriela said, adding that they thought at first that it came from a China Coast Guard (CCG) ship.\nHe said the chopper was gray and had \"Chinese markings\" on its side that translated to \"Chinese Navy.\"\n\"This is the first created_at that we have sighted this kind of aircraft in the area,\" Tarriela said.\nEarlier this month, the PCG said China had reinstalled a floating barrier near Bajo de Masinloc in the West Philippine Sea, which is part of the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nTwo CCG vessels (3063 and 3064) were also positioned at the entrance to the lagoon, and speedboats were deployed to make sure the floating barriers were well guarded, Tarriela said.\nIn September 2023, the PCG on the President's orders cut a 300-meter barrier installed by China to keep Filipino fishermen out of the shoal. At the created_at, it also vowed to \"do whatever it takes\" to remove any more floating barriers installed by China.\nThe PCG and BFAR started their regular rotational deployment in Bajo de Masinloc early this month.\nThe move is part of efforts to secure Filipino fishermen in these waters and to help achieve the government's vision of food security, National Security Adviser Eduardo Año said.\nBajo de Masinloc is located 120 nautical miles west of Luzon, which places it within the Philippines' EEZ.\nOldest partner\nIn a pre-departure press briefing Tuesday in Malacañang, Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Daniel Espiritu said the President's participation at the summit was important as it would give Asean and Australian leaders a chance to discuss geopolitical issues affecting the region.\n\"If you will remember, Australia is the Asean's oldest dialogue partner. It's also one of the most active, one of the most dynamic in all fronts - in the political security, economic and socio-cultural pillars of Asean,\" Espiritu said.\n\"As the first Asean Leaders level engagement for the year, the summit presents an opportunity for us to present the Philippines' core position on regional and international issues and set the tone for dialogue partner summits later in the year, especially in October,\" he added.\nEspiritu said Marcos is expected to attend the Leaders' Plenary and the Leaders' Retreat, the two main engagements on the Asean-Australia Summit on March 6.\nHe said the President would take the opportunity to thank Australia for its unwavering support for the rule of law, the 1982 United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea, and the 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling on the South China Sea.\n\"The President may also highlight Asean-Australia cooperation on maricreated_at issues, climate and clean energy..., people-to-people exchange, and economic cooperation,\" Espiritu said.\n\"At the Leaders Retreat, the President may encourage Australia to remain committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes and to maintain respect for the rules-based international order and multilateralism, which is currently very much under challenge,\" he added.\nAt the same press briefing, Foreign Affairs spokesman Ma. Teresita Daza said the South China Sea issue will be raised, given that both the Philippines and Australia are maricreated_at nations that must ensure peace at sea.\n\"We have very strong defense and security relations with Australia. They have been partners with us for a long created_at, even before the official establishment of relations because they were with us as partners during World War 2, and now the relations have actually seen an elevation from comprehensive to strategic partnership,\" Daza said.\nJamming\nIn the same public briefing, Tarriela accused China of jamming the tracking signal of PCG and BFAR ships that are patrolling the shoal.\nHe said it was the third created_at they noticed that whenever the PCG and BFAR vessels come close to Bajo de Masinloc, they lose their automatic identification system (AIS) signal.\nAIS platforms allow maricreated_at authorities to track and monitor vessel movements.\nTarriela said they believe that the CCG is jamming the tracking signal of PCG ships, so the Philippine government will not be able to monitor the movement of its vessels effectively once they are out at sea.\nHe said the signal jamming almost always happens \"in the same hour\" when China declares that it has successfully driven Philippine ships away from Bajo de Masinloc.\nThe CCG recently claimed that it \"expelled a BFAR vessel and PCG vessel\" that allegedly intruded into their waters.\nThis claim was dismissed by the Philippine government.\nHowever, a pro-Beijing group, Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute, said the PCG's allegation of signal jamming was \"hurled without evidence.\"\nThe group's president, Herman Tiu Laurel, said this \"may be a way to cover up the invariable failure to break the CCG blockade of construction materials to BRP Sierra Madre and guarding of the entrances to the Scarborough Shoal lagoon fish sanctuary.\"\nHe said the move to get Filipino fishermen to congregate at Scarborough Shoal was aimed at multiplying their numbers to provoke a reaction from the Chinese.\n\"None of these gimmicks change the fundamentals of the situation and only magnify tensions,\" he said.\n"

    "text": "\nFeb. 28—MANILA ( Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN) — The Philippine Navy has monitored \"interference\" in its \"electronic capabilities\" during operations in the West Philippine Sea, an official said Tuesday.\nCommodore Roy Vincent Trinidad, Navy spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, however, said the meddling had no serious impact on their overall navigation, maintaining their naval systems remain secure.\nEarlier, Trinidad said in a regular press briefing in Camp Aguinaldo that \"activities of China in the West Philippines Sea have been going on for quite some created_at when it comes to interference on our electronic capabilities. It has been going on for the past three to four years, maybe even earlier.\"\nAfter the press conference, however, Trinidad clarified that it could not yet be determined which country was causing the interference in their naval operations.\n\"We have also noted an increase in interference, but we could not say for sure kung saan nanggaling (where it came from),\" he later told INQUIRER.net in a phone interview.\nBinay on Padilla's apology over wife's IV drip photo: May it serve as lesson — INQToday\n\"We could not say na China ang gumawa noon (We can't say if China did it). The fact is, may interference sa communications (there is interference in communications),\" he further said.\nIn another interview with reporters, Trinidad said there is a need to conduct forensic tests to determine the source of the interference.\nAddressing the issue\nDuring the press briefing, the Navy official gave assurance that several contingencies are in place to deal with the matter.\n\"The interference on the electronic equipment did not reach a stage that they will interfere with the navigation; these are more on the communications on land, cellphones, but on the overall impact on the operation, they do not really cause a significant impact,\" Trinidad emphasized.\n\"There are protocols [on] how to address that so rest assured that we have been addressing these issues but we have noted them for the past good number of years,\" he added.\nTrinidad disclosed the information after the Philippine Coast Guard alleged that the China Coast Guard is using signal jammers on their tracking system at certain created_ats during recent operations in the West Philippine Sea.\nThe PCG said this briefly prevents Philippine ships from broadcasting their positions in the area.\nPCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela noted on February 25 that \"there were instances\" that the vessels could not transmit their automatic identification signals (AIS).\nThe AIS transmits a vessel's position so that they could be identified and located by other ships. They are also trackable through ground stations and satellites.\n___ (c)2024 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

    "text": "\nTaiwan has detected eleven Chinese ships in the past twenty-four hours around the island, the Ministry of Defense in Taipei has reported, a figure that is a record since the beginning of the year. Specifically, around the island, the ministry said.\nIn December, 11 Chinese ships were spotted in Taiwan on the eve of the island's presidential election, which was won by Lai Ching-te , whom Beijing called a \"separatist.\" On Monday, a Chinese maricreated_at surveillance ship and four Chinese coast guard vessels briefly entered waters around Kinmen, according to Kuan Bi-ling, Taiwan's minister in charge of ocean affairs.\nIn addition to warships, China has increased the dispatch of maricreated_at research vessels to as close as 24 nautical miles off Taiwan's coast, in a demonstration of Beijing's new surveillance capabilities to gather crucial data for naval warfare. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, states can claim a contiguous zone of up to 24 nautical miles from their coast, giving them resource rights and jurisdiction over the surface and bottom of that ocean area.\nAccording to the Financial created_ats, China frequently uses vessels operated by government and military research institutes to assert its claims in disputed waters, sailing near oil exploration sites within Vietnam and Malaysia's exclusive economic zones in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety. Maricreated_at research vessels can measure water temperature, salinity and ocean currents and map the seabed, data that can be used for a wide range of scientific research, but also for naval warfare.\n\"Where maricreated_at research vessels go is where Chinese submarines will go in the future,\" Christopher Sharman, director of the China Maricreated_at Studies Institute at the U.S. Naval War College, told the Financial created_ats.\nThe increased maricreated_at activity near Taiwan comes amid heightened tensions between Beijing and Taipei following a deadly incident at sea involving a Taiwanese coast guard vessel.\nIncident in the Kinmen Islands\nIt all happened as follows. A Chinese speedboat carrying four people capsized on February 14 near the Kinmen Islands while being pursued by the Taiwanese Coast Guard, resulting in the death of two Chinese fishermen. The other two crew members were rescued and temporarily detained in Kinmen.\nBeijing accused the Taiwanese authorities of \"trying to evade responsibility and hide the truth\" about the incident. According to Taiwan Coast Guard statements, the Chinese vessel involved was zigzagging, \"lost its balance and capsized\" while trying to escape from the patrol boat.\n\"The actions taken by Taiwanese authorities seriously hurt the feelings of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. And, since the incident occurred, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities have not apologized,\" Zhu Fenglian, spokeswoman for the Chinese government's Taiwan Affairs Office, Zhu Fenglian, protested at a press conference. According to Zhu, the Taiwanese government has \"lied\" and \"concealed the truth\", \"without showing humanity\". \n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines Department of Energy announced this week the auction of eight blocks (pre-determined areas, or PDAs) for energy investment. The blocks include areas where oil, gas, coal and natural hydrogen may be developed. Working with the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and Energy (MENRE) of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), the DOE is hoping to secure future energy sources for the Philippines, which is facing not only declining production from its Malampaya gas field, but is also wrestling with China over territorial rights in the South China Sea.  \nAccording to the DOE, the projects have attracted strong interest from local and international energy investors with some 50 companies attending the launch. Winner bidders are to be announced during the second half of 2024.  \nThree blocks for petroleum exploration and one block for coal exploration are located in the BARMM, which is in the southern region of the Philippines.  \nFourteen wells have already been drilled in three of the BARMM blocks where there have been indications of oil and gas at 10 of the wells, Reuters reported.  \nThe resources in the BARMM area are assets that can be fully developed, Energy Secretary Raphael Lotilla told Filippino media. \"As we take another step forward in harnessing these assets, our aspirations for promoting economic growth, generating employment opportunities, and nurturing a thriving business landscape in the region are even closer to realisation,\" he said.  \nThe four blocks in the Philippine bid round include two being offered for petroleum exploration in Northwest Palawan and Southern Cebu. The Northwest Palawan block is offshore and located 60km from the northern coast of Busuanga Island. Five wells have been drilled there already leading to the discovery of the Calauit and Calauit South oil fields where there is a reserve estimated at 5.5-6.1mn barrels. There are also additional prospects.  \nThere are also two other blocks in Central Luzon that are being offered for exploration and development of natural hydrogen.  \nThe Philippine Bid Round is a government-led process that invites oil and gas companies to participate in competitive bidding for the right to explore and develop specific acreage within the country, a statement said. This initiative aims to facilitate efficient oil and gas exploration, promote economic growth and ensure responsible resource management within the nation, it added.  \n\"Leveraging on these opportunities, we invite local and foreign investors to be our partners in achieving energy security and self-sufficiency in the region and the entire Philippines,\" Lotilla said.  \nIn order to prepare for future energy demand, the country has begun to establish LNG import terminals. The Philippines main source of gas, Malampaya, is expected to be depleted by 2027. However, last year the government signed a 15-year extension with the gas field operator, which will drill new wells in order to extend the life of the field.\n"

They employ joint-warfighting capabilities in pursuit of national objectives against a peer adversary. Participants get to practice decision making against a thinking opponent, experiencing the interactive nature of war.\n\"The National Military Strategy has identified China as the pacing threat,\" said Col. David Woodley, a facilitator for the wargame at AWC. \"Professional military education naturally uses Pacific-based scenarios for the students to wargame. We do allow the students to play both the United States and China. We think it is important in PME for the student to have the opportunity to play both sides in the wargame.\"\nIn a focused preparatory scenario, both U.S. and China employ their respective industrial base to ensure the most advantageous force presentation for a possible South China Sea kinetic engagement almost immediately.\nPhase I consists of three turns, each representing a six-month period. This prepares and assesses student thought of how competition of this type, in the modern theater, is involved.\nPhase II includes further escalation and enters a period of deliberate combined Freedom of Navigation Operations, navigating through escalated action taken in the regional waterways. This is the created_at where diplomatic, economic and information instruments of power in support of military operations is practiced. Facilitators evaluate how students respond to the challenges of combat operations against the pacing threat without air or sea superiority.\nAll these phases are actioned with a deck of cards, spawning new and viable assets with each play. These items can range from instituting an element of air superiority to launching an information campaign in Russia.\n\"Wargaming is additive and enhances the current PME curriculum. Senior-level PME is an academic-based, graduate-level education that requires students to read, write, present, and design strategies. Wargaming allows the students to execute their strategy,\" Woodley said.\n\"The success of wargame in a PME environment is for the student to have conversations and discussions and be able to witness their strategy in action. It is not about letter grades or correct strategies. It is about the students using what they learn in a classroom environment in a wargame. Since most of our students will leave senior-level PME and be on staff, they will be armed with what they learned in PME to come up with military recommendations for senior leadership.\"\nWargames are woven throughout the many levels of PME across the university. Students engage in gameplay intermittently throughout their courses as curriculum guides.\n* * *\nOriginal text here: \nCopyright Targeted News Services\nMSTRUCK-8505596 MSTRUCK\n"

Armand Balilo, PCG spokesperson, said 'two malicious short videos' were posted on the PCG's Facebook page on Monday night.\nBut when personnel of the Coast Guard Public Affairs Service (CGPAS) tried to delete the videos, Balilo said the service was alerted with a forced 'switch account' notification.\nHe added that based on the initial diagnostic of the CGPAS, 'the unknown entity did not leave any digital traces on the official email address and the mobile phone used by the CGPAS to establish a security key as an additional layer of online security protection.'\nRegaining access\nIn a separate statement on Tuesday, Balilo said the PCG had already coordinated with Meta, the parent company of Facebook, and 'provided needed details to regain page access' as more videos were posted on its Facebook page.\nOne of the videos from the movie 'Locked Up' had a caption that read, 'Bullying the wrong person and a worthy ending.'\n'After initial consultation with the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group, the CGPAS considers the possibility of online security breach through malware (malicious software),' Balilo said.\nAccording to him, the CGPAS already met with the Coast Guard Weapons, Communications, Electronics, and Information System Command to conduct back-end operations for page recovery.\nAs of 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the PCG had yet to regain access to its Facebook page.\nThe PCG has referred to the latest incident as 'hacking,' a term it refused to use when its X account was compromised earlier this month as it connoted 'malicious intent.'\nDuring the Feb. 15 attack, hackers wiped out the PCG's entire page contents since it was put up in 2013, including its logo and profile picture, although these were 'retrieved' about five hours later.\nElectronic jamming\nAt a press briefing on Tuesday morning at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City, Commodore Roy Vincent Trinidad, Philippine Navy spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, said there had also been an increase in interference on the electronic capabilities of Philippine ships in the West Philippine Sea, particularly during rotation and resupply missions.\nTrinidad issued the remark after Commodore Jay Tarriela, PCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, said China had been jamming the signal of Philippine vessels in the West Philippine Sea, adding that 'there were instances' that the government's vessels could not transmit their automatic identification signals.\nTrinidad said during the briefing that 'activities of China in the West Philippines Sea have been going on for quite some created_at when it comes to interference on our electronic capabilities.'\nHe added that based on his discussion with the commander of naval forces in Palawan, the interference 'has been going on for the past three to four years, maybe even earlier.'\n'They have noted an increase in cyber interference, electronic interference and jamming and stuff like that, not only for equipment of the ships but also for land-based communication equipment,' he pointed out.\nHowever, he later told reporters that he could not directly say if China was the main source of the interference.\n'I would need the appropriate Navy office or General Headquarters to say that after we do all the forensics,' he said.\nAccording to Trinidad, the interference had minimal impact on the ships' operations.\n'The effect is minimal because the interference on the electronic equipment did not reach a stage that they will interfere with the navigation, these are more on the communications on land, cell phones, but on the overall impact on the operation they do not really cause a significant impact,' he said.\n"

    "text": "\nDo you think in No 10 that the penny has dropped? Do you think in the offices of Sir Keir Starmer that they are aware of the world they may face? We are witnessing a world in conflict: Ukraine, Gaza, the Red Sea and Iran. And storm clouds are gathering in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. In this globalised age, there is no escaping the consequences of war and it is getting harder and harder to contain flash points.\nEven before the Hamas attacks and Houthi missile strikes , I warned that conflict was coming and that we must be ready. If Britain is to be safe, it needs to be able to deter her adversaries and support her allies. To do that, we need to put our hands in our pockets and sustainably fund our Armed Forces.\nWhen I took over at Defence in 2019, I inherited a department that had suffered 30 years of cuts. Labour reduced defence spending from 3 per cent of GDP to around 2.6 per cent and we kept going. Imagine what that does to the people in a department. Imagine the effect it has on the culture of the Armed Forces. No other department in Whitehall has suffered like this. Not our friends in the NHS, who somecreated_ats got twice yearly increases despite failing to boost productivity.\nSo I was pleased that, in 2019, Boris Johnson gave me a real defence funding increase and, by the created_at I left, I had secured £31 billion more for defence between 2021 and 2028. I had also, I thought, persuaded the government of the need to put defence back into the mainstream of politics and spending.\nRemember the promise offered by Jeremy Hunt to spend 3 per cent of GDP “whatever other pressures we face”, his claim in the 2022 Autumn Statement that “the Prime Minister and I both recognise the need to increase defence spending” and the pledge to spend 2.5 per cent “when economic conditions” allow. All sounded promising.\nCuriously there is now silence  and, as the election approaches, the Treasury is up to its usual trick of “tucking under”: inflating budgets with dollops of other departments’ capital underspends or even artificially inflating the defence budget with £1.6 billion of VAT receipts. That is not a sustainable way to invest and plan defence policy.\nI fear that both parties will do the usual thing and say “we don’t want defence to become an election issue”. Well it must and it should be. No other department suffers stop-start, almost annual, fingers-crossed budgets. And few departments commission billions of pounds of projects that take years to come online. But unlike other departments, Defence has enemies who spout regular misleading claims and yesterday’s strategy. Take a glance across the media and you will see “rent a quote” former admirals and colonels who left the Armed Forces 20 to 30 years ago. They fight yesterday’s wars and pretend they had nothing to do with the MoD I inherited.\nThere are also the misleading allegations of “waste”. Let me put some facts out there. At any one created_at, Defence Equipment & Support manages about 2,600 contracts and 550 programmes. It delivers 98 per cent of key user requirements and 89 per cent of contractual milestones to plan. When I was defence secretary, we balanced the budget three years in a row.\nBig programmes do go wrong. In my experience there are a number of drivers of that. One is inflation. Obviously a project that takes years is vulnerable to commodity price and wage growth. Another is No 10 and Treasury pressure to “delay” contracts. But “delaying” costs hundreds of millions of pounds. Labour did it and previous Tory governments did it. I had a rule: deliver or delete but don’t delay – unless of course the Treasury is prepared to fund the delay costs.\nAnd then we have that ignorant question: “why can’t you buy off the shelf?”. As if there is a supermarket for nuclear weapons or submarines. And how many nations are prepared to delay their own programmes to let you jump the queue? Or how do you ensure that your supply chain and your competitors allow your choice of missile on their platform? They have no answers.\nWar is coming. It might be a cold war or it might be a hot one, but by the end of the decade, if we are to defend this nation, we need to be match fit and modern. We will need 3 per cent of GDP to do what we need to do and to lead in Nato  and in Europe. We will need 3 per cent to make sure the men and women of the Armed Forces are lethal but also protected.\nI am sorry to disappoint the armchair admirals, but the new Armed Forces will also look different and much of the money may not go where they expect. We must not let force structure trump innovation and we must expect our new generation of chiefs to shape an Armed Forces for tomorrow’s war not yesterday’s.\nAt the general election, defence must be a priority for all the parties. If it is not, know that in four to five years’ created_at, when we are not ready and more vulnerable, it was in 2024 when the government of the day, be that Conservative or Labour, failed to invest in the safety of the UK.\n"

    "text": "\nSince taking office in mid-2022, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has moved the Philippines closer to the US, even risking ire from Beijing by signing a new defense agreement with Washington.\nMarcos Jr. also pushed to normalize ties with the EU that had been badly damaged by his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, whose brutal \"war on drugs\" prompted criticism from Europe. Duterte responded with expletive-laden tirades, telling European leaders to stay out of his country's affairs and threatening to expel all European ambassadors.\nBut in 2023, Ursula von der Leyen became the first sitting European Commission president to visit the Philippines, where she spoke of a \"new era of cooperation between us.\" Marcos Jr. is now set to visit Germany next month and Brussels in December.\nBrussels and Manila have also agreed to restart talks over a free trade agreements that had broken down in 2015 under Duterte. Marcos Jr.'s pick for his foreign secretary, Enrique Manalo, can also be seen as a signal to the EU - Manalo had previously served as an ambassador to several European states and as head of the Philippine Mission in Brussels.\nBut analysts have said the changes between the Philippines and the EU are driven by deeper geopolitical factors.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 was a major catalyst, according to Joshua Espena, a resident fellow at the International Development and Security Cooperation, a Manila-based think tank. Espena said Europe needed to strengthen its global supply chains and has attempted to \"tap into the Indo-Pacific region.\"\nFirst South Asian leader to choose between US, China\nWhereas Duterte attempted to forge closer relations between the Philippines and China, with varying degrees of success, Marcos Jr. entered office with a resolutely pro-Western stance.\nTensions between Manila and Beijing, especially over the territory they contest in the South China Sea, have massively escalated over the past 12 months, and last year, the EU and the Philippines announced a new maricreated_at defense agreement.\nIn October, the EU and the Philippines signed the 60 million ($65 million) Financing Agreement for the Green Economy Program, a result of the Marcos Jr. administration's focus on climate action.\n\"Marcos Jr. can be considered Europe's 'best friend' in Southeast Asia,\" said Alfred Gerstl, an expert on Indo-Pacific international relations at the University of Vienna.\nMarcos Jr. has canceled some prominent infrastructure projects that were part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative. According to Gerstl, the EU's Global Gateway Initiative, a EU-led global investment scheme, could fill some of the void.\nWriting about US-Philippines relations last month, the Council on Foreign Relations analyst Joshua Kurlantzick argued that, \"Marcos Jr. has moved Manila into the US camp more than any other Southeast Asian leader, seemingly becoming the first Southeast Asian leader to 'choose' between the United States and China.\"\nConcerns over constitution\nSome of the analysts DW spoke with said it was simply good timing that Marcos Jr. entered office and gave every appearance of being a more democratic, liberal and like-minded politician at a created_at when European leaders were desperate, because of the Ukraine war, to find new partners.\nBut many doubt Manila has actually changed in terms of democracy and human rights.\nMarcos Jr. will be someone the EU can work with \"for as long as the EU does not look too closely enough to see that the looming change in the Philippine Constitution is likely to result in an even weaker democracy than before,\" said Sol Dorotea Iglesias, assistant professor of political science at the University of the Philippines.\nSome critics said Marcos Jr. could change the constitution to make it easier for foreign investors to purchase or create companies in certain industries. This might also give him a chance to remove provisions that limit a president's power.\nMarcos Jr., however, has rejected this possibility.\nWhat if the ICC goes after Duterte?\nAnother issue could arise over the ongoing investigations into former President Duterte for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court.\nIf the Marcos Jr. government refuses to cooperate, \"the EU may be forced to finally take more drastic measures such as suspending the trade privileges of the Philippines,\" said Iglesias.\n\"Among the EU institutions, the European Parliament has often had a sharper eye on such risks and may continue to play the role of watchdog as this drama unfolds,\" she added.\nOn the other hand, European leaders are likely to be willing to overlook any lingering concerns about human rights in the Philippines because they see Marcos Jr. personally as a reliable partner, said a European Commission official who requested anonymity.\nEU looking for Asian allies\nThe official added that Brussels is keen to view Marcos Jr. in the best of light since it remains distrustful of many other Southeast Asian leaders.\nRelations with Muslim-majority Malaysia have soured over European support for Israel in its war with Hamas and because of Brussels' environmental regulations, the source noted. Thailand's new coalition government is unstable. Vietnam remains a key partner in the region, but EU relations with its communist government are irregular, while Cambodia remains in the EU's bad books for its democratic regression.\nBrussels is also still cautious with Prabowo Subianto, who is likely to become Indonesia's next president after an election earlier this month. Prabowo has taken a particularly hostile stance toward the EU over high-tension disputes regarding how EU environmental regulations will impact Indonesia's palm oil sector.\nAccording to Espena at the International Development and Security Cooperation, the EU and the Philippines have every reason to want to keep improving relations.\n\"Friendships do not need to be OK all of the created_at ,and while personal relations are important, deep-seated interests based on the structural conditions of the world matter more,\" he said.\nSource: DW - Deutsche Welle\n"

    "title": "Marcos says Chinese Navy presence in South China Sea is ‘worrisome’",
    "created_at": "2024-02-29",
    "text": "\nPresident Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. on Wednesday said the presence of Chinese warships in the South China Sea and increased cyberattacks are worrisome, but these would not deter his resolve to defend Philippine sea claims and protect Filipino fishermen.\n“Before, only the Coast Guard of China was moving in our areas,” he told reporters before flying to Australia for a state visit. “Now, it’s the Navy too.”\nThe Philippine Coast Guard spotted Chinese Navy vessels during a patrol mission by a fishery bureau vessel near Scarborough Shoal last week, just as Manila raised alarm over increased cyber-attacks and electronic interference targeting its communication equipment.\nMr. Marcos, who has pursued closer security ties with the US and other western allies, said his government would continue to defend Filipino fishermen’s access to Scarborough Shoal, which Manila calls Bajo de Masinloc.\n“The basic principle there is that the fishers must be allowed to fish in their traditional fishing grounds, which belong to the maricreated_at territory of the Philippines,” he added.\nMeanwhile, the US Indo-Pacific strategy is unlikely to change if Donald Trump wins the presidential race, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel G. Romualdez said.\nIn a speech, the Philippine envoy said he was in touch with one of Mr. Trump’s close advisers, who told him about the continuation of the US stance in the region.\nThe Philippines would not let up in asserting its sea claims, Mr. Romualdez said in a speech, as tensions in the South China Sea continue to simmer, with China vehemently opposed to what it considers incursions by Philippine vessels into what it considers its waters.\nThe “aggression” we are now facing is very real, Mr. Romualdez said, adding that the Philippines hopes China would see the value of continuing economic activity between them while trying to peacefully resolve their issues.\nIn an interview with Reuters last week, Mr. Romualdez, a cousin of President Marcos, said the Philippines was closely watching the US presidential race but would view any change in leadership as an opportunity to renew the strengthening alliance between the two countries.\nTheir security engagements have stepped up considerably under US President Joseph R. Biden and Mr. Marcos, with both leaders keen to counter what they see as China’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea and near Taiwan.\nMr. Biden is likely to face Mr. Trump, the Republican frontrunner to become the party’s presidential candidate, in a rematch in November’s presidential election.\nUnder Mr. Marcos, the Philippines has nearly doubled the number of its bases accessible to US forces. Mr. Marcos last year succeeded in pushing Washington to clarify the extent of a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty that binds them to defend each other in case of an attack.\nMr. Romualdez on Wednesday said it was possible there could be one major “accident” in the South China Sea that could lead to that treaty being invoked, but hoped that would never happen.\nA United Nations court based in the Hague in 2016 voided China’s claim to more than 80% of the South China Sea and upheld the traditional fishing rights of small-scale Filipino and Chinese fishermen at Scarborough Shoal.\nThe shoal is 240 kilometers west of the main Philippine island of Luzon and is nearly 900 kilometers from Hainan, the nearest major Chinese landmass.\nThe Philippine Navy on Tuesday said it had monitored increased cyberattacks and electronic interference targeting their communication capabilities.\nThese usually happened during resupply missions, said Roy Vincent Trinidad, the Navy’s spokesman for South China Sea issues. But the Navy could not determine the source of the interference.\nIt made the report after Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesman Jay Tristan Tarriela accused China at the weekend of preventing Philippine vessels from broadcasting their positions at sea by jamming the signal of their tracking system.\n“We assume that they do the jamming every created_at they release their statements that they repelled our vessels.”\nThe PCG last week belied the Chinese coast guard’s claim it had driven away a Philippine fishery vessel from waters near Scarborough Shoal, which China has occupied since 2012.\nAlso on Wednesday, Mandaluyong City Rep. Neptali Medina Gonzales II, who heads a House of Representatives special committee on the West Philippine Sea, said the government would continue filing diplomatic protests against China to assert its claim in the South China Sea.\n“We have to show to the world that we are not relinquishing our claim,” he said in a statement. “We cannot be silent on the issue as the countries who are supportive of our cause will also lose interest if we ourselves cannot show any interest,” he added in mixed English and Filipino.\n"

    "title": "'Dramatic shift': China's maricreated_at militia intensifies activity in South China Sea",
    "created_at": "2024-02-29",
    "text": "\nNEW DELHI: China's maricreated_at militia, historically elusive and misunderstood, has markedly increased its visibility in the South China Sea disputes over the past year, according to data by the Washington-based Asia Maricreated_at Transparency Initiative. This rise in visibility comes through a significant uptick in militia vessels involved in altercations and standoffs, particularly with the Philippines at Second Thomas Shoal. These actions, closely aligned with the China Coast Guard, have brought international attention to the situation through widespread media coverage.Increased militia presenceIn 2023, an examination of satellite imagery from Planet Labs revealed a persistent presence of Chinese militia ships across nine key locations in the South China Sea.As per a Bloomberg report, the increase from a year earlier was accompanied by 'a dramatic shift' in vessels to Mischief Reef in the summer of 2023 when over 180 boats were observed gathered there from July. \nThe reef is also claimed by the Philippines and Vietnam.“The data shows that China’s militia is as active as ever,” the report says. “The reason for this increase, an anomaly compared to the previous year’s peak of only 37 vessels at Mischief, is unclear.”This review identified an average daily presence of 195 militia ships, marking a 35% increase from the previous year.Militia composition and operationsThe analysis differentiated between professional militia vessels from Hainan and the so-called “Spratly Backbone Fleet” of commercial ships operating under subsidies in contested waters. The focus was on vessels between 45 to 65 meters, a size indicative of Chinese militia trawlers and distinct from other regional fishing or coast guard ships. This approach aimed to provide a clearer picture of militia activities, despite not capturing the entirety of operations across the vast maricreated_at area.Seasonal variations and geographical focusThe data also highlighted seasonal reductions in militia presence, particularly from late December to mid-February, likely due to holiday periods. Nonetheless, the largest and most consistent gatherings of militia ships were observed at Hughes and Whitsun Reefs, underscoring the strategic importance of Union Banks as a preferred militia anchorage.Militia's role in regional disputesThe increased militia activity, especially at Mischief Reef, raises questions about China’s strategic intentions in the region. Despite the militia's primary involvement in areas like Union Banks, their readiness to support China Coast Guard operations during contentious periods, such as the resupply missions to the BRP Sierra Madre at Second Thomas Shoal, demonstrates their operational flexibility and strategic importance to China's broader maricreated_at objectives.The evolving role and increasing assertiveness of China's maricreated_at militia pose significant challenges for regional security and the ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The anticipated regulatory changes and the militia's expanding presence indicate a strategic shift that could impact the regional power dynamics and necessitate a recalibrated response from neighboring countries and international stakeholders.

    "text": "\nThe 'aggression' the Philippines faces from China in the disputed sea is unprecedented, says the country's ambassador to the US, Jose Manuel RomualdezWhile there is a US-Philippine mutual defence treaty, invoking the pact will mean 'all hell breaks loose' in the region\nThe Philippines' top envoy in the United States has said the South China Sea, not Taiwan, is the \"real flashpoint\" for an armed conflict in the region, warning \"all hell would break loose\" if Washington decides to invoke a mutual security treaty to defend Manila in the disputed waterway. \nAmbassador Jose Manuel Romualdez said the threat of growing maricreated_at tension between his country and China turning into a military campaign was more alarming than the prospect of Beijing invading the island. \n\"The real problem and the real flashpoint, which is why I'm telling you how critical it is for us. The real flashpoint is in the West Philippine Sea,\" Romualdez said. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nThe West Philippine Sea is the term Manila uses to describe the eastern parts of the South China Sea that are within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and territorial waters. \nThe diplomat also said Chinese President Xi Jinping was \"not going to make a move unless he is absolutely sure that he can militarily take over Taiwan\". \nBeijing sees Taiwan a breakaway province to be eventually reunited, by force if necessary. While many nations, including the US, do not officially acknowledge Taiwan as an independent state, they oppose any use of force to alter the existing status quo. \nThe Philippines has in the past accused the Chinese coastguard of confronting its ships in the hotly-contested sea, including firing water cannons at them. \nIn the latest incident, a vessel belonging to the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources received a radio challenge from a Chinese warship on February 21 as it sailed towards the Beijing-controlled Scarborough Shoal. \nThe disputed shoal lies 240km (150 miles) west of the Philippines' main island of Luzon and nearly 900km from the nearest major Chinese land mass of Hainan. \n\"The aggression that we are now facing is very real,\" Romualdez said. \"Never in our lifecreated_at, even during World War II, did we face such a challenge because this country will not let up on their claim in many of our territorial waters.\" \nThe diplomat added the frequent stand-offs in the South China Sea could trigger the 1951 mutual defence treaty, which obliges Washington to come to Manila's defence in case of an armed attack, but its implementation comes at a cost. \n\"All of these skirmishes that are happening, there can be one major accident and either one of our countries, the US or the Philippines, can invoke the [treaty] and when we do, a commitment made by the US or the commitment we made will happen, and then all hell breaks loose,\" Romualdez said. \nHe also pushed for diplomacy to douse tension between the Philippines and China, saying the Southeast Asian nation was working on preventing a situation where the allies could be forced to use the military pact. \n\"We hope it will never happen,\" GMA News quoted him as saying. \nBeijing claims sovereignty over almost the entirety of the South China Sea - where the Philippines and several other Southeast Asian nations have competing claims - and has rejected a 2016 international ruling that ruled in favour of Manila and found China's assertions have no legal basis. \nCopyright (c) 2024.

    "title": "AS CHINA FLEXES MUSCLE IN SOUTH CHINA SEA, JAPAN DRAWS 10-YEAR ROAD MAP TO CHALLENGE BEIJING",
    "created_at": "2024-02-29",
    "text": "\n As Japan is drawing up a new 10-year roadmap to strengthen its defence relations with Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia by improving their naval capabilities, the Indo-Pacific region is about to see the emergence of strong counter measures against China which continues to pose a challenge to peace and security around the South and East China Seas and the Taiwan Strait.\nThe South China Morning Post quoted Masafumi Iida, a senior official of the National Institute of Defence Studies, a think tank which is affiliated with Japan's Ministry of Defence as saying that under the plan, Japan will provide 'sustained and evolving assistance over a period of a decade' to Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia as they are struggling to save their atolls and shoals in the South China Sea from being encroached upon by China. Details of the roadmap for improving maricreated_at capabilities of four Southeast Asian nations are being drawn up by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).\nWhile the proposed roadmap is not expected to see the light of the day very soon, discussion is going on among the Japanese authorities over the provision of drones, radar systems and patrol boats to all four Southeast Asian nations.   In the meanwhile, Japanese officials have conducted on-site surveys in Philippines and Indonesia and similar activities are scheduled for April in Malaysia and Vietnam, NHK, the Japanese news outlet said.\nAmid this, questions are being raised on the fate of the Official Security Assistance (OSA) which was launched by Tokyo last year.\nUnder OSA, Japan announced providing financial assistance to the national security authorities of other countries to boost their defence capabilities in order to strengthen regional stability.\nIt was said that the OSA will run in parallel to Japanese Overseas Development Assistance.\nThere is an understanding that the new 10-year road map being drawn up to enhance maricreated_at capabilities of Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia will work as an additional framework of support for these four Southeast Asian countries in the area of defence.\nIn simple words, Japan will help Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia in procuring quality defence equipment and infrastructure to fight off China's threat to their sovereign areas in the South China Sea.\nIn fact, China lays claim over 90% of the South China Sea and as such, in violation of international law, continues to threaten those countries which have overlapping claims over this water text of the Pacific Ocean.   On January 18, as per The Japan created_ats, officials of the JICA and Japan's embassy in Manila met officials of the Philippines government to discuss Tokyo's intention to offer OSA-related assistance to the Southeast Asian country in the midst of the evolving security challenges in the region.\nEarlier in November 2023, Tokyo and Manila during Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's maiden visit to the Philippines, agreed to begin their talks on the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) - a pact that provides the legal framework for greater bilateral security cooperation, The Yomiuri Shimbun said.\nOnce Japan and Philippines conclude RAA, the armed forces of the two countries will get access to each other's bases and undertake rotational deployment of troops and begin joint exercises. Japan had previously signed similar agreements with Australia and the UK.\nIn November, during the visit to the Philippines, Kishida as the Japanese Prime Minister had pledged to provide $4 million worth of coastal surveillance radars to Manila under the OSA framework, making the Philippines the first Southeast Asian country to become a beneficiary of Japan's security assistance programme. Significantly, Tokyo's announcement of providing coastal surveillance radars to Manila came close on the heels of Japan delivering the first air surveillance radar system to Philippines that the Southeast Asian nation procured from Japan under a 2020 deal. Japan's objective behind such assistance is to create a bulwark of defence and security mechanism around the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.\nThis factor was also present when Prime Minister Kishida, during his visit to Malaysia on November 4, 2023, agreed to 'accelerate coordination for the implementation of the OSA and concurred to further strengthen cooperation in the maricreated_at field, including joint training and exchanges between the Japan Self-Defence Forces and the Malaysian Armed Forces as well as joint training between coast guard agencies of the two countries,' Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Japan has agreed to provide $2.8 million to Malaysia to boost its maricreated_at security.\nWith Vietnam, Japan agreed to deepen military cooperation even more than before, 'to maintain and enhance a free and open international order based on the rule of law,' Japanese Prime Minister Kishida was quoted by The Yomiuri Shimbun as saying during a press conference with Vietnamese President Vo Van Thuong in Tokyo on November 28, 2023. During the Vietnamese President's visit, the two countries had concurred upgrading Tokyo-Hanoi ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership. Japan had also agreed to provide weapons and defence technology to Vietnam under the OSA framework which is under discussion between the two countries. Japan also agreed to provide the Indonesian coast guard with a patrol vessel worth $63million to help Jakarta enhance its maricreated_at capability.\nInterestingly, China has so far not issued any statement against Japan's new roadmap for security assistance to four Southeast Asian nations, but Global created_ats, which is mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had made a scathing comment against Tokyo when it had organised a special summit with the ASEAN in December last year. China's English daily said, 'Japan's ambition to use Southeast Asian countries to improve its maricreated_at defence capabilities deserves vigilance.' China appeared to be peeved at the joint statement issued by Japan and ASEAN after the summit. 'Japan and ASEAN will commit to security cooperation including maricreated_at security cooperation,' Japan-ASEAN joint statement said. 'If defence cooperation between Japan and Southeast Asian countries is directed against a third party, it will have a very negative impact on the stability of the regional order,' Global created_ats said.\nIn recent years, given the radically altered geo-security situation in the Indo-Pacific region, with China and North Korea flexing their military capabilities, Japan's pacifist idealism has given way to pragmatic and proactive moves.\nIt has changed the course of its defence and security policy.\nWhile churning is within Japan's ruling establishment on hosting US nuclear weapons facilities on Japanese soil, Tokyo has not ruled out developing the capability to strike at enemy bases.\nIn order to maintain a rules-based global order and preserve world peace, it is not shying away from developing new policy initiatives, including a network of strategic and economic partnerships and expanding security and defence cooperation with regional partners and like-minded countries in the Indo-Pacific region.\n"

    "text": "\n2024 FEB 29 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Genomics & Genetics Daily -- Researchers detail new data in marine science. According to news originating from Nanning, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Relatively high-latitude coral reefs could be potential 'refuges' for corals under climate change. One of the most important aspects limiting their availability as refuges is low-temperature stress.\" \n Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province. \n The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Guangxi University: \"However, the mechanisms underlying the response of coral holobionts to low-temperature stress is unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms by recording the maximum quantum yields of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) and transcriptome responses of Porites lutea under acute (1-2 weeks) and chronic (6-12 weeks) low-temperature stress at 20°C and 14°C. The P. lutea samples were collected from a relatively high-latitude coral reef in the South China Sea (109°00'-109°15'E and 21°00'-21°10' N). The study suggested that: (1) Under acute low-temperature stress, the Fv/Fm of Symbiodiniaceae dropped by 64%, which was significantly higher than the 49% observed under chronic stress. Low-temperature stress inhibited photosystem II(PSII) functioning, with greater inhibition under acute stress. (2) Downregulation of sugar metabolism-related genes under low-temperature stress implied that the decrease in energy was due to obstruction of PSII. (3) Under low-temperature stress, calcification-related genes were downregulated in coral hosts, possibly because of energy deprivation caused by inhibited photosynthesis, Symbiodiniaceae expulsion, and oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling in mitochondria. (4) Acute low-temperature stress induced the upregulation of genes related to the TNF signaling pathway and endoplasmic reticulum stress, promoting apoptosis and coral bleaching. However, these phenomena were not observed during chronic stress, suggesting acclimation to chronic low-temperature stress and a greater survival pressure of acute low-temperature stress on coral holobionts.\" \n According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In conclusion, low-temperature stress inhibits Symbiodiniaceae PSII functioning, reducing energy production and affecting calcification in coral holobionts. Acute low-temperature stress is more threatening to coral holobionts than chronic stress.\" \n For more information on this research see: The acute and chronic low-temperature stress responses in Porites lutea from a relatively high-latitude coral reef of the South China Sea.

    "title": "Manila's attempt to rally external forces on S.China Sea issue will only backfire",
    "created_at": "2024-02-29",
    "text": "\nOnce again, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr has demonstrated his naivety and strategic immaturity on the international stage, this created_at in Australia. \nDuring his visit to Australia, Marcos told the Australian parliament on Thursday that he would not allow any foreign power to take \"one square inch\" of the country's territory. \"As in 1942, the Philippines now finds itself on the frontline against actions that undermine regional peace, erode regional stability, and threaten regional success,\" said Marcos.\nMarcos was playing his old trick - attempting to play the victim card, portraying China as \"bullying\" the Philippines in the South China Sea to garner more international support and exert pressure on China. He made these remarks because, after Manila's several unsuccessful attempts to forcibly intrude into waters of reefs and islands near China's Nansha Islands, the Philippines starts to call white black - complaining that Chinese navy's presence in the South China Sea is \"worrisome.\"\nThe one who is \"undermining regional peace, eroding regional stability\" is precisely the Philippines. From February 2 to 9, the Philippine Coast Guard Ship 9701 repeatedly trespassed on the waters adjacent to Huangyan Dao.\nOn February 15, the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources vessel 3005 illegally intruded into the adjacent waters of Huangyan Dao.\nFrom February 22 to 23, vessel 3002 of the Philippines' Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Bureau made the intrusion into waters near Huangyan Dao despite repeated warning calls from the China Coast Guard \nDespite this, ironically, the Philippines is shamelessly portraying itself as being on the \"frontline\" against \"actions that undermine regional peace.\" \nThe Philippines' naive and simplistic attempts to rally external forces such as Australia will ultimately fail, Chen Xiangmiao, director of the World Navy Research Center at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the Global created_ats. \nThe Philippines has failed to grasp the current and future regional and international geopolitical landscape, placing itself in the wrong position, said Chen. First, regardless of how the US suppresses China, the fact that China is the world's second-largest economy and a growing military power cannot be changed. Second, no other ASEAN countries are willing to stand behind the Philippines' South China Sea provocations. At the just-concluded Munich Security Conference, the Defense Minister of Singapore repeatedly emphasized avoiding a conflict in Asia. In this context, the Philippines positioning itself as a fighter under US lead is truly naïve and extremely lack of intellect.\nAustralia, as well as some other countries, can only offer limited support to the Philippines, primarily symbolic diplomatic backing rather than substantial support. Moreover, such hype and support has now reached its ceiling. Therefore, to maintain its provocations in the South China Sea, the Philippines needs to involve more countries, maintaining international attention. However, the Philippines' continuous creation of conflicts and incidents, and the involvement of external countries in South China Sea affairs, will only make the disputes more complex, difficult to resolve, and prone to maricreated_at conflicts, Yan Yan, director of the Research Center of Oceans Law and Policy at National Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the Global created_ats.\nFrom Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's \"historic\" visit to the Philippines, the elevation of bilateral relations to a \"strategic\" level, to the first joint exercises and patrols in the South China Sea since Marcos took office in 2022, Philippine-Australian relations have quickly warmed up, stirring up waves in the South China Sea. In this drama, the Philippines, Australia, and the US behind the scenes are all calculating their own geopolitical interests, each with their own hidden agenda.\nOn one hand, amid the ongoing strengthening of the US-led alliance system and its Indo-Pacific Strategy, the Philippines attempts to leverage countries such as Australia and Japan to garner international support. On the other hand, Australia also seeks to use the South China Sea issue as a lever to intervene in regional dynamics. By actively cooperating with the US to promote its South China Sea strategy, including frequent interactions with the Philippines, Australia aims to emphasize its crucial strategic position in the Indo-Pacific regions and enhance its bargaining power in its relations with China. If the Philippines were to engage in a war with China over the South China Sea issue, who would truly come to Manila's aid and offer genuine support? No one.\nUltimately, the issue in the South China Sea needs to be resolved through friendly negotiations among the parties involved. As a stakeholder in the South China Sea, the Philippines speaks one way but acts another, fabricating a series of hot-spot incidents regarding the Ren'ai Reef and Huangyan Dao, distorting facts, and refusing to return to the correct path of negotiating and managing disputes with China. Instead, it seeks to rally more external forces to counterbalance China, which is not feasible and will ultimately affect regional peace and stability. \n"

The patrol is still ongoing.  \nNgeow Chow-Bing, director of the Institute of China Studies at the University of Malaya, said Malaysia had maintained a low-profile approach to China's maricreated_at intrusions for more than a decade, preferring to register its protests through diplomatic channels while sending out navy and coastguard vessels to keep an eye on the Chinese boats.  \n\"This is the standard approach and will remain so unless the status quo is disrupted,\" Ngeow said, adding that a \"noisier\" approach was unnecessary and could even be counterproductive.While Malaysia's trade and economic ties with China were important, Ngeow said the country also derived benefits from having a stable and positive relationship with Beijing while carefully managing their differences. \nIn a rare instance of vocal opposition, Malaysia publicly spoke out against China's latest map last August that laid claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, including areas off the coast of Malaysian Borneo. \n\"However, it is felt that there is no need to dwell on this map after the official position has been clearly stated,\" Ngeow said. \nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, on a visit to China last September, said Beijing had assured him it would continue to negotiate with Southeast Asian nations over disputed territorial claims in the waterway, and avoid actions that risked escalation. \nBrian Wong, assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Hong Kong and an adviser on strategy for the Oxford Global Society think tank, said while Malaysia firmly viewed the South China Sea as a core part of its security interests, it was wary of any overt attempt to unilaterally alter the status quo in the region. \n\"The uneasy equilibrium is one that [Malaysia] is keen to maintain,\" he said, adding that the administration \"does not believe direct confrontation and unbridled escalation over the region is conducive towards its geopolitical interests\".  \nWong said Malaysia was engaging in \"delicate expectation management\" as it sought to ensure continued trade connectivity with China, while also positioning itself as a \"more strategically non-aligned but economically friendly partner\", especially to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative in the region. \n\"[Malaysia is] trying to nudge China, through more amiable calls, onto a multilateralist path for resolution of territorial disputes,\" he added. \nChina has been Malaysia's largest trading partner since 2009, with total trade between both nations reaching a record US$203.6 billion in 2022, according to Chinese official figures.  \nIn 2022, Malaysia exports of palm oil and related products to China amounted to US$3.72 billion, accounting for 11.4 per cent of the country's total worldwide exports of these products.  \nLast May, China said it would invest an estimated US$38.64 billion in Malaysia, including in the petrochemical and automotive industries. \nPrashanth Parameswaran, fellow at the Wilson Centre in Washington DC and founder of the weekly Asean Wonk newsletter, said Malaysia \"may not be as loud as the Philippines\" in its public remarks, but China's maricreated_at assertiveness continued to be a concern for the country. \nAware of its economic dependence on China, Parameswaran said Malaysia had over the past year pushed for more diversified foreign investment and upgrading of security ties with partners like Japan. In December, Japan and Malaysia signed a security assistance deal that would include a US$2.8 million grant to boost Malaysia's maricreated_at security, and the provision of rescue boats and supplies.\n"

    "text": "\nMELBOURNE, Australia — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told Australia’s Parliament on Thursday that the strategic partnership between the two nations was more important than ever with the rule of law and peace in the region under threat from China.\nMarcos told a special joint sitting of the two chambers during a state visit that the Philippines would not allow a foreign power to “take even one square inch of our sovereign territory.”\nIt is a declaration he has often repeated since taking office in 2022 and refers to China’s disputed claims to the Philippines' territory in the South China Sea.\nMarcos said Australia and the Philippines need to band together against new challenges to the region’s peace and stability, as they had against Japanese forces during World War II.\n“Not one single country can do this by itself. No single force can counter them by themselves,” Marcos said. “This is why our strategic partnership has grown more important than ever.”\nMarcos said his father, former President Ferdinand Marcos, and then-Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam reaffirmed that the security of their two countries was bound together in 1974 when they toured the Philippines' WWII battlefields of Bataan and Corregidor.\nAustralia and the Philippines for the first created_at conducted joint sea and air patrols in the South China Sea in November last year.\nMarcos said the Philippines and Australia fought to build a rules-based international order after WWII, and that they must now fight to protect that order in the South China Sea.\n“The protection of the South China Sea as a vital, critical global artery is crucial to the preservation of regional peace and, I dare say, of global peace,” Marcos said.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese reminded Marcos of his words when the leaders last met: prosperity and progress dependent on peace.\n“That is what is so significant about the maricreated_at cooperation activities our two navies completed together for the first created_at in November last year,” Albanese said.\n“Our cooperation is an assertion of our national interest and a recognition of our regional responsibility,” Albanese added.\nMarcos’ address was interrupted briefly by Senator Janet Rice, from the minor Greens party, who held up a sign that read: “Stop human rights abuses,” in a protest against the Philippines' record on rights.\nRice was later censured by a majority of her colleagues in the Senate with a motion that disapproved of her “unparliamentary and disrespectful conduct” in her protest and her “disregard for the importance of Australia-Philippines relations.” The censure is symbolic and carries no consequences for Rice.\nMarcos and Albanese on Thursday announced new agreements on maricreated_at cooperation, cybersecurity and fair trade regulation.\nFollowing the two-day state visit, which ends on Thursday, Marcos will return to Australia next week with other Southeast Asian leaders to take part in an ASEAN-Australia Summit that marks 50 years of Australia’s partnership with the regional bloc.\n"

    "text": "\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. adopted a tough stance over the South China Sea disputes against China and sought greater security cooperation with allies during his visit to Australia on Thursday, a move that Chinese experts regarded as aiming to drag Australia into the Philippines' provocative and confrontational strategy.\nDespite a high-profile reception and an agreement to boost collaboration on maricreated_at security signed by the two sides, analysts warned that Australia should adopt a prudent attitude over questions concerning China's territorial sovereignty and integrity if Canberra does not want to become an anti-China tool of Manila and see the hard-won recovery of China-Australia relations fall to a low point once again.\nIn his address to the Australian parliament on Thursday, the first by a Philippine leader, Marcos said he will \"not allow any attempt by any foreign power to take even one square inch of our sovereign territory,\" alluding to the heating South China Sea dispute with China.\nAccording to the Australian government, the two leaders announced new Memoranda of Understanding, including enhanced maricreated_at cooperation to strengthen existing civil and defense maricreated_at commitments. \nExperts believe that the Philippines and Australia's pursuit of strengthening military cooperation may have negative consequences for regional security and stability: the regional arms race may intensify and the existing economic integration process in the Asia Pacific will be impacted.\nIn response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press briefing on Thursday that the current situation in the South China Sea remains generally stable, and relevant countries \"should not harm the interests of other countries or undermine regional peace and stability\" when conducting maricreated_at security cooperation.\nLi Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global created_ats on Thursday that Marcos' trip is mainly about lobbying for more support for the Philippines to take more aggressive and risky actions on South China Sea disputes.\nThe Philippines hopes to drag Australia into its confrontational and provocative strategy against China, said Chen Hong, director of the Australian Studies Center at East China Normal University, echoing Li. \nMarcos has turned the Australian parliament into a platform to stir up regional tensions and to incite Australian people and politicians against China, and that looks malicious, said Chen. \nMarcos' trip came after Albanese became the first sitting Australian prime minister in two decades to visit the Philippines in September 2023. During the trip, the two leaders signed a strategic partnership agreement that elevates their relationship. The Philippines and Australia also ran their first joint sea and air patrols in the South China Sea in November 2023, showing the two sides' relationship getting warmer. \nMarcos also stressed on Thursday that Australia and the US are the only countries with whom the Philippines has a \"visiting forces agreement,\" according to media reports. He said the Philippines was on the \"frontline\" against actions that \"undermine regional peace, erode regional stability.\"\nMarcos' Australia trip, on the other hand, is actually cooperating with the US to promote Washington's creation of a \"small NATO\" in the Asia Pacific, Li said. \nAccording to Chen, Australia is always under pressure from the US. In addition, Australia's opposition leader Peter Dutton has been criticizing the Albanese government for being \"soft\" on China as Australia prepares to usher in the next federal parliamentary election in 2025. In this case, the Australian government tried to use the Philippines to hype up China-related topics and attempted to show a tougher attitude toward China. \n\"However, the current strategy adopted by the Albanese government is seemingly more of a response to the US strategy on the surface, such as giving Marcos a high-level reception and signing agreements, but the Albanese government will take a cautious attitude in substance and specific actions,\" said Chen.\nRelations between China and Australia had deteriorated under the government of previous prime minister Scott Morrision. Since Albanese took office, bilateral relations have improved and achieved basic stability, a situation that was hard-won.\nAustralians are well aware that no good will come of Australia becoming a tool of the Philippines to confront China, Chen said. \nAccording to data from the Australian government, China is Australia's largest two-way trading partner, accounting for 26 percent of Canberra's goods and services trade with the world in FY2022-23. Two-way trade with China increased 12 percent in FY2022-23, totaling $316.9 billion.\nCiting sources, the South China Morning Post said on Thursday that Australia has invited Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for a two-day visit in the second half of March. \nChina is resolute in defending its territorial sovereignty, said Chen, noting that if Australia chooses confrontation against China with the Philippines, Beijing-Canberra ties, which have managed to recover, will hit a low point again, with future disputes being more difficult to properly resolve.\n"

    "text": "\nOf all the issues that strain the agenda of the bilateral relationship between China and the United States - the trade and technology war, the situation in Hong Kong, cybersecurity, the escalation of arms, and so on - there are two that appear to be the main challenges: Taiwan and the disputes related to the South China Sea. Both pose a systemic risk to regional and global stability, and could lead to scenarios of major confrontation between the two powers.\nOn the one hand, relations between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China are at their lowest point in recent years. After the general elections in January, the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) renewed its status as the ruling party for the third consecutive created_at, although the Kuomintang Party, which defends the maintenance of the status quo and smooth relations with mainland China, retained its majority in the local Parliament, and this has at least for the created_at being moderated the separatist discourse of the ruling group, which knows that radicalization would provoke an armed confrontation.\nWe do not yet know whether the new government in Taipei will maintain the minimum moderation or whether it will bet, with Washington's approval, on incurring in new provocative displays as it has done in recent years.\nOn the other hand, the US has shown signs of wanting to tighten the noose even more, as in the case of the approval by Congress in Washington to sell weapons and military technology to Taiwan.\nThe future of regional and global stability will depend to a large extent on how China reacts, and it is foreseeable that it will opt for diplomatic and military caution.\n2. With an area of approximately 3.5 million square kilometers, the South China Sea delimits the coastlines of Brunei, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam and China itself. More than half of the world's merchant traffic sails through its waters. Eighty percent of China's energy imports cross there, just as it is the maricreated_at gateway on which Korea's and Japan's energy imports depend. Not only does it have six created_ats more oil tanker activity than the Suez Canal, under its waters there are estimated to be oil and natural gas reserves similar to those of Qatar.\nThe group of islets in the South China Sea, in spite of being mostly desert and unproductive, have a strategic value due to their capacity to establish the international demarcations of the countries in the area and their so-called Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), and have therefore been a source of controversy.\nFaced with the complexity of these disputes and claims, China bases its position on a 1947 map that no country has questioned and on three elements: 1) to raise the issue of its legitimate sovereignty taking into consideration the geographical, historical and legal aspects, within the framework of international maricreated_at law; 2) to reject the internationalization of the problem, opting for the negotiation of bilateral agreements; and 3) to give priority to the economic development of the area, above the sovereignty disputes.\nIn this sense, China's commitment to multiple bilateral agreements is opposed to international mediation, as other countries in the dispute have pretended. The agreements include joint exploitation rights, guarantees of freedom of air and maricreated_at traffic, without this representing the ceding of its sovereignty.\nThis strategic maricreated_at zone allows China not to be isolated in the event of a naval blockade. Strengthening maricreated_at power in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean is the essential way for China's emergence on the global stage. The tools of dialogue and diplomacy must be used.\n"

No one single country can do this by itself.\"\nLink to Image\nAlex Ellinghausen\nThe president said Australia's destiny was irrevocably linked to that of Asia and that \"over the years you have held true to this tenet. You have become a valuable member of Asia and of the Indo-Pacific.\"\nThe comment echoes that of former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who in the 1990s described Australia as a US outpost but who by 2019 argued Australia's future lay in Asia.\nAhead of the ASEAN-Australia summit in Melbourne next week, Marcos also highlighted the threat climate change posed to both his own country and the entire region, and said that developed countries such as Australia must do more to combat the warming of the planet.\nMarcos was elected president in 2022 and is widely known by his nickname \"Bongbong\". He is the son of former Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr, who ruled the country from 1965 to 1986 and whose wife, Imelda, was famous for owning several thousand pairs of shoes.\nLink to Image\nAlex Ellinghausen\nMarcos Jr told parliament: \"I will not allow any attempt by any foreign power to take even one square inch of our sovereign territory.\"\n\"For the Philippines, Australia plays a crucial role as one of only two partners with which the Philippines has a visiting forces agreement,\" he said, highlighting a Filipino-US-Australian joint exercise that involved 560 Filipino soldiers, 1200 Australian service personnel and 120 US marines.\n\"The protection of the South China Sea, a critical global artery, is crucial to the preservation of regional peace and, I dare say, of global peace. We have an abiding interest in keeping our seas free and open and in ensuring unimpeded passage and freedom of navigation.\"\nChina claims almost the entirety of the South China Sea as its own but is in dispute with the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei and Indonesia over these claims.\nChina frowns on so-called freedom of navigation operations undertaken by the United States, Australia and other nations in the air and on the water in the South China Sea and has regularly flown or sailed aggressively close to other nations' vessels.\nIn 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled China had no claim to large swaths of the South China Sea, but Beijing ignored the ruling and built a series of military bases, including on outcrops such as the Scarborough Shoal and the Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, which are close to the Philippines' main islands.\nThe two navies and coastguard services clash frequently over disputed territory.\nUnlike his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who was friendlier to China and whose war on drugs led to credible accusations that thousands of people were murdered in extra-judicial killings, Marcos has re-positioned the Philippines within the United States' sphere of influence in South-East Asia.\nAlbanese praised the Philippines as one of Australia's key partners in the region and said \"we share a vision for an open, stable and prosperous region\".\n\"Our nations have never been closer, and realising opportunities through our strategic partnership will bring great benefits to Australians and Filipinos,\" Albanese said.\nThe two leaders signed new memoranda of understanding enhancing co-operation on maricreated_at, cyber and critical technology.\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

But the Philippines' clashes with swarming Chinese coast guard and fishing vessels last year as it struggled to resupply its lone outpost on the Second Thomas Shoal, just 200 kilometres from its shores, have been among the most intense in the whole crisis over claims in the South China Sea.\nAustralia has been noticeably upfront in supporting the Philippines, with Defence Minister Richard Marles promising joint maricreated_at patrols last year and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visiting Manila even as he confirmed a historic fence-mending trip to Beijing. China has clearly singled out the Philippines for special attention.\nA 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling on a case brought by Manila has become the chief legal basis for international pushback against China's claims in the South China Sea.\nManila's historic ties with Washington have rebounded after Mr Marcos's predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, tilted to Beijing for a few years. Mr Marcos had allowed the US four new bases in the country, overlooking the Luzon Channel between the Philippines and Taiwan and an important exit from the South China Sea. Beijing appears bent on both punishing Manila and demonstrating that Washington can't help it much, which makes Australia's support even more significant.\nIt's not unreasonable to question whether America has the capacity or inclination to remain a dominant power in Asia as it was in, say, the 1980s. But what changed significantly in just the past few years is that Australia has become part of a tightening network of Asian nations including Japan, South Korea, and India that want to keep the US engaged and are suspicious of Beijing's intentions.\nMr Marcos also gave his speech on the eve of the fourth ASEAN-Australia Summit, when most of South-East Asia's heads of government will be in Melbourne. ASEAN is the text those nations rely on to provide a first diplomatic counterweight to China. ASEAN has lasted since 1967 by not pressing positions too hard and by seeking the lowest common denominator of agreement.\nBut \"ASEAN centrality\" is still the key phrase in regional diplomatic jargon. Experts say that its real meaning is in giving big powers like China and the US a means of talking to the region, yet without being big enough to actually stymie them. ASEAN lives in fear of grey zone confrontations at sea turning into real conflicts that would engulf them all.\nIt sees a Swiss-style neutrality as its best defence against overbearing big powers like China. That means as few weapons in the region as possible, and essentially relying on China's own economic self-interest in South-East Asia to hold it back. But ASEAN accepts that front-line members like the Philippines and Vietnam are going to push back by themselves when they have to.\nASEAN is also the key to Foreign Minister Penny Wong's hope for greater \"regional equilibrium\" in which all states large and small can co-exist in a system of rules. That is the ideal solution by far to the tensions in the region.\nBut Australia is also right to offer solidarity to the Philippines. A binding code of conduct covering the South China Sea between Beijing and ASEAN has been discussed since the 1990s, but is stuck at the stage of talks about discussions to actually bring it into existence.\nUntil then, Australia is right to support nations whose waters come under pressure.\nAnd regional dynamics might be changing. ASEAN often takes its cues from its biggest member, Indonesia, whose president-elect Prabowo Subianto is likely to follow President Marcos in telling China to keep off, and rightly seeking international support to do so.\n\nGraphic\n \nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese and Philippines President Ferdinand R Marcos jnr.\n"

We will not yield,\" he said.\nLast year, Australia and the Philippines held joint military drills in the South China Sea as Manila tried to build deeper security and strategic links with Western nations under Mr Marcos.\nHe said the South China Sea was a \"critical global artery\" that was \"crucial to the preservation of regional and … global peace\".\n\"Once again, we must come together as partners to face the common challenges confronting the region. Not one single country can do this by itself.

Today, that peace, that stability, and our continued success, have come under threat,\" he added\nMarcos lamented that geopolitical polarities and strategic competitions jeopardize the \"hard-won peace\" in the region, stressing that there remains to be \"unresolved inequities and inequalities within and amongst nations\".\nHe also noted that \"powerful and transformative\" technologies can destabilize the political and social order.\nHe said the Philippines and Australia need to join forces and seek help from other allied countries \"in the face of threats to the rule of law, to stability, and peace.\"\n\"It has become crucial for us now to envision the shape, the breadth, and the depth of our Strategic Partnership and how it must move forward as we weather the storms of global volatility,\" Marcos said.\n\"In Australia, we see a natural partner in our efforts to defend, preserve, to uphold our open, inclusive, and rules-based international order to ensure that it remains governed by international law and informed by the principles of equity and justice.\"\nThe Philippines, Marcos said, will not allow any attempts to undermine regional peace, stability and success.\nProtecting South China Sea\nMarcos also stressed the need to protect the South China Sea (SCS) to ensure the continued prosperity of the region.\n\"The protection of the South China Sea as a vital, critical global artery is crucial to the preservation of regional peace and, I daresay, of global peace. We have an abiding interest in keeping our seas free and open and in ensuring unimpeded passage and freedom of navigation,\" he said.\n\"We must uphold, preserve, and defend the unified and universal character of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as the constitution of the oceans.\"\nAmid the long-standing disputes in the SCS, Marcos maintained that the Philippines would remain firm in defending its sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction.\n\"I shall never tire of repeating the declaration that I made from the first day that I took office: I will not allow any attempt by any foreign power to take even one square inch of our sovereign territory. The challenges that we face may be formidable, but equally formidable is our resolve. We will not yield,\" Marcos said.\nNuclear risk reduction, carbon neutrality\nMarcos also expressed support for Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's vision of \"a world free of nuclear weapons.\"\nConsidering the emerging technologies such as autonomous weapon systems, Marcos said \"there is much room\" for the two nations to work together.\n\"Within the ambit of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Regional Forum and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, our two countries are champions of nuclear disarmament and advocates for nuclear risk reduction.\nMarcos said climate change also \"threatens our very existence,\" adding that \"tectonic shifts are acutely felt in the Indo-Pacific\".\nHe said developed nations must act now and do more to address the \"glaring disproportion between our share of responsibility and our vulnerability.\"\nThis, as he emphasized the importance of carbon neutrality.\n\"The Philippines has the potential to be a net carbon sink, absorbing more carbon dioxide than we emit. Yet, we are one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, ranking first in the 2023 World Risk Index,\" Marcos said.\n\"My country accepts its part in our collective responsibility. My administration is committed to accelerating our just, affordable, sustainable, and inclusive energy transition towards carbon neutrality,\" he added.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Philippines News Agency.

And I commend you for your personal resolve, Mr President, for you and your country's courage in calling out acts of coercion and the Philippines' steadfast commitment to international law.\" \nGreens foreign affairs spokesman Jordon Steele-John criticised the Philippines' record on human rights, calling on Labor to recognise recent violations. \n\"Successive Filipino governments have a long history of human rights abuses,\" he said.\n\nNotes\nDocument links may not lead to an active page.

Marcos Jr. will participate in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-Australia Special Summit in Melbourne from March 4 to 6, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said Tuesday.\nMarcos will attend the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit upon the invitation of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, DFA Assistant Secretary for ASEAN Affairs Daniel Espiritu said in a pre-departure briefing with Palace reporters.\nThe summit presents an opportunity for us to present the Philippines' core position on regional and international issues and set the tone for dialogue partners' summit later in the year, especially in October, Espiritu said.\nEspiritu said Marcos is expected to attend the Leaders' Plenary and the Leaders' Retreat, the two main engagements on the ASEAN-Australia Summit Proper on March 6.\nDuring his participation in the Leaders' Plenary, Marcos would take the opportunity to thank Australia for its unwavering support for the rule of law, the 1982 United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) ruling on the South China Sea (SCS).\nThe President may also highlight ASEAN-Australia cooperation on maricreated_at issues, climate and clean energy track, people-to-people exchange, and economic cooperation, Espiritu said.\nEspiritu added that Marcos, during the Leaders' Retreat, is expected to encourage Australia to remain committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes, as well as to maintain respect for the rules-based international order and multilateralism, considering that these are currently very much under challenge.\nDFA spokesperson Ma. Teresita Daza said the SCS issue will be raised, given that the Philippines has strong defense and security relations with Australia.\nIn terms of what's happening in the region and what is happening within our region, one issue will be the South China Sea. And it's also worth mentioning that Australia and the Philippines are maricreated_at nations and it cannot be denied that it will be something that will have to be raised as well, Daza said.\nOther engagements\nMarcos would also hold separate meetings with other world leaders, Australian business leaders, and the Filipino community in Melbourne on the sidelines of the ASEAN-Australian Special Summit, Espiritu said.\nEspiritu said Marcos is expected to have separate bilateral meetings with Cambodia and New Zealand. He, however, did not elaborate on the matter.\nMarcos, he said, would also deliver a keynote speech at the Lowy Institute on March 4 to highlight the Philippines' role as an active participant in world affairs and a contributor to the rules-based regional security architecture.\nAlso on March 4, Marcos will meet with his fellow Filipinos at Melbourne's town hall.\nMarcos would also deliver remarks during the launch of the Victoria International Container Terminal, the first-fully automated container terminal of Australia, on March 5.\nEspiritu said there would also be a Philippine Business Forum in Melbourne to promote the country's business climate and entice more investments.\nMarcos' scheduled attendance to ASEAN-Australia Special Summit in Melbourne will be the second leg of his visit to Australia.\nHe will first visit Canberra on Feb. 28 to 29 to serve as guest of the Australian government and address the Australian Parliament to discuss the vision for the Philippines and Australia's strategic partnership.\nDaza said Marcos will return to the Philippines after his visit to Canberra and will fly back to Australia for the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit. - PNA\n"

Nguyen Chi Tuyen, known as the Anh Chi blogger, was apprehended at his home in Hanoi’s Long Bien district. \nA group of about 10 people, some in police uniforms, arrived at their house on Thursday morning, ostensibly to exchange views with Tuyen. However, the situation took a drastic turn when approximately 10 additional individuals suddenly broke into their home and arrested him. The police conducted a search of the premises, seizing several items, including a Nokia phone that Mr. Tuyen was using, a laptop, and a handwritten manuscript. His wife expressed shock, emphasizing that Tuyen had not committed any wrongdoing but had merely expressed his opinions as a concerned citizen. She clarified that he had no intention of challenging the state or overthrowing the leadership of the communist party. Tuyen, a civil rights activist, maintains a YouTube channel with nearly 100,000 subscribers, where he has posted over 1,600 video clips discussing politics and other issues. His videos often highlight farmers protesting against land seizures by authorities or criticize China’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea. Tuyen gained prominence for his anti-China stance, particularly opposing the establishment of a Chinese oil rig in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone in 2014. In an interview with the Mekong Review, he boldly declared, \"I am willing to sacrifice my life (to struggle) for freedom.\"\n©2024 GMC S.A.P.A. di G. P. Marra. Visit at adnkronos.com.

    "title": "China's Asia-Pacific moves much more peaceful than US",
    "created_at": "2024-02-29",
    "text": "\nIn the evolving geopolitical landscape of the Asia-Pacific region, the dynamics of international relations are constantly in flux. The joint statement issued by the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea at the recent \"Trilateral Indo-Pacific Dialogue\" and China's response to it offer an insight into the complex interplay of regional power politics. China has remained a proponent of peace, emphasizing the importance of adopting a regional approach to settling differences without the interference of non-regional countries. Dialogue and consultation are the only way to manage, even resolve, differences between countries.\nThe concerns the joint statement raised over China's claim in the South China Sea and the allegations it made against China (including accusing China of \"escalatory behavior\") were firmly rebutted by Beijing. To be sure, Beijing's response is not merely a matter of diplomatic posturing but also deeply rooted in the country's broader vision for the region - a vision characterized by peace, stability and cooperation.\nChina's economic endeavors and cultural impact have positioned it as a key player shaping the dynamics of the region. This role is distinct from that of the United States, which often appears to adopt a combative stance, heavily influenced by traditional power dynamics. In contrast to the US, which is often viewed as an outsider exerting its influence on the region, China has always made efforts to preserve peace, and promote collaboration and cooperation, strived for unity and collective progress. When it comes to the South China Sea, for China, it is not just a place through which the country's strategic maricreated_at routes pass but also an essential part of its maricreated_at domain. As opposed to the confrontational approach of the US and its two allies, China advocates using peaceful dialogue and consultation to resolve disputes, in line with international laws and conventions, notably the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nMoreover, China sees the formation of such trilateral groupings as a step toward creating exclusionary blocs - a move that it argues is counterproductive to the collective goal of regional peace and stability. China favors inclusivity and multipolar cooperation over alignments that more often than not are aimed at building power blocs reminiscent of the Cold War-era days. This shows China wants to help build a world order in which no single country or coalition dictates the rules of engagement.\nOn the Taiwan question, Beijing's position is clear. The one-China principle is the bedrock of its foreign policy. For Beijing, any external interference in the Taiwan question or support for separatists on the island is a violation of the one-China principle and a challenge to the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. From Beijing's viewpoint, the key to maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is the unwavering adherence to the one-China principle. China's response to the trilateral dialogue and the joint statement reflects its larger vision for and deep understanding of the region. The Asia-Pacific, as seen by Beijing, is not a battleground for geopolitical contests but a region for cooperation and development. This view is totally different from the strategy of forming alliances and blocs, which, according to China, only serves to heighten tensions and create divisions.\nChina's call to abandon the Cold War mentality is a significant aspect of its international relations. Instead of forming alliances and blocs, which often lead to tensions and conflicts, and shift people's attention from common threats such as deteriorating global governance and worsening climate change, China promotes a new type of international relations marked by mutual respect, cooperation and shared benefits - and aimed at maintaining long-term peace and prosperity in the region. China's emphasis that the regional players make more efforts to maintain peace and stability underscores its vision of a multipolar world order, in which the international community operates on the basis of equality and collective decision-making, and all countries, regardless of their size and national strength, contribute to shaping the regional and global narratives.\nChina's response to the US-Japan-ROK joint statement reflects a nuanced interplay of its principles, national interests, and vision for a fairer and equitable regional and global order. At its core, China's stance is about safeguarding its sovereignty, fostering cooperation and helping build a balanced, multipolar world order. As the Asia-Pacific region continues to emerge as a key geopolitical arena, understanding these perspectives becomes essential for navigating the complex currents of international relations. And the path to stability and prosperity in the region passes through mutual respect, constructive dialogue, and a commitment to the principles that prioritize peace and collaborative growth. China's advocacy of the Pacific vision stands as a testament to its commitment to these ideals, enriching the discourse on regional geopolitics.\n"

While most members are trying to hedge between the two, some such as the Philippines are closer to the US while others, like Cambodia, are moving closer to China.\nFrank language\nWhile Mr Marcos did not name China in his speech, he used incredibly frank language for a South-East Asian leader not heard before in Australia's parliament. The intent was clear, given the growing friction between Beijing and Manila over competing territorial maricreated_at claims.\nA 2016 ruling by an international tribunal under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea found heavily in the Philippines' favour, dismissing China's \"nine-dash line\" maricreated_at claims. But Beijing has repudiated the ruling.\nMr Marcos said Australia's backing for the ruling was welcome, as he warned instability in the South China Sea was a threat to world peace, and it was vital that global trade arteries remained open.\nHe said the strategic partnership between Australia and the Philippines had grown more important than ever, noting Australia and the US were the only two countries Manila had a visiting military forces agreement with.\nHe highlighted how last year Australia and the Philippines conducted their first joint patrol of the South China Sea, while 1200 Australian troops also participated in joint war games with Filipino and US troops.\n\"We are called upon once again to join forces, together with our partners, in the face of threats to the rule of law, to stability and to peace,\" Mr Marcos said.\n\"We must reinforce each other's strengths, we must protect the peace that we fought for during [World War II] and have jealously guarded in the decades since.\n\"We must oppose actions that clearly denigrate the rule of law.\n\"As in 1942, the Philippines now finds itself on the front line against actions that undermine regional peace, erode regional stability and threaten regional success.

The challenges that we face may be formidable, but equally formidable is our resolve.

The maricreated_at co-operation agreement covers civil maricreated_at security, marine environment protection, maricreated_at domain awareness and promoting respect for international law.\nAn agreement on cyber and critical technology is aimed at protecting against cyberattacks and fostering co-operation on the digital economy, while the countries' competition commissions will work together to enhance competition law and policy.\nMr Albanese said that as both island and trading nations, the Law of the Sea was \"not an abstract notion or a theoretical question\" for Australia and the Philippines, as he also highlighted the importance of the joint naval patrols.\n\"Freedom of navigation is fundamental to our sovereignty, our prosperity, our security and our territorial integrity,\" he said.\n\"Our co-operation is an assertion of our national interest and a recognition of our regional responsibility.\n\"It reflects our shared understanding that peace depends on more than the presence of the great powers. All of us in the international community, middle powers like our countries, as well as small nations, have our part to play in building a more stable, peaceful and prosperous future.\"\n"

    "text": "\nAUKUS taking focus away from Australia's immediate security issues\nAustralians have been told for generations the United States is vital to Australia's defence and security. The Anglo-centric defence and foreign affairs establishment in Canberra still sees a non-polar world dominated by the US, and is focused on preventing an emerging multi-polar world. This has been national policy since the Cold War, placing an important emphasis on ANZUS. This stance has been supported by think tanks like the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), heavily funded by the pro-US defence establishment, and got Australia involved in a number of meaningless wars and military actions.\nThe 'demonization' of China and Russia is making it almost impossible to put forward alternative viewpoints, where one would be labelled a Sino-Sympathiser or Putin supporter. Iran and North Korea are seen as evil empires, where history plays no credence, as we saw in the Ukraine playbook.\nThe new AUKUS alliance between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States locks Australia into US and UK Pacific policy for at least another 30, if not 50 years. As Australia's defence spending hits AUD 50 billion in the 2023-24 budget, surpassing 2.0 percent of GDP, a proportion of those funds are beginning to be spent on projecting an Australian presence into the East China Sea and Taiwan Straits. These areas are of little true strategic interest to Australia, when there is a wide area of sea to Australia's west, north, and east, shared with a number of emerging nations.\nThe 2023 Defence Strategic Review (DSR), which is a blueprint for Australia's future defence posture came with a built in assumption that Australia's security correlates with US policy in the region. The DSR even goes further, saying that the Australia-US alliance will become even more important in the coming decades (see P.18). Building up regional ties was a mere afterthought.\nThe DSR was a lost opportunity to debate any alternative options concerning Australia's security future.\nAustralia's immediate neighbourhood is a rapidly changing place\nAustralian defence capabilities have slipped over the last few decades, with critical shortages in manpower. This has happened when our near neighbour's defence capacity has risen to the point of where some now consider Indonesia to be a middle power, occupying an area to the immediate north-west of the Australian mainland. Australia's Lowy Institute also cites Indonesia as a regional middle power. Indonesia's GDP is now 75 percent of Australia's GDP and could surpass Australia over the next decade.\nIndonesia will spend AUD 38 billion on defence this year modernizing its military. Military spending could become even a higher priority for Indonesia if Prabowo Subianto wins the presidential election to be held later this year.\nWhile the political and military dynamics are rapidly changing in Australia's own neighbourhood, there are distinct risks that Australia's visons are fixated further afield, completely missing what lays just before us.\nAustralia's immediate neighbourhood could have been given more consideration. The attention given to the immediate region appears to be token. The potential security effects of any natural disaster, or any radical shift in any neighbour's ideology would be of far greater concern than the game of détente being played between China and the US. As we are witnessing in Myanmar, potential regime change is not a far-fetched reality.\nWhat is Australia banking on today with the US?\nUS defence policy appears flawed and has become overly aggressive over the last 3 years of the Biden administration. Diplomacy as a tool has been downgraded and lack of it, failed to avert massive scaling up of the Russo-Ukraine war over the last two years. A peace agreement was vetoed by the administration more than a year ago, costing endless Ukrainian lives, and stepping up international frictions. There is open speculation over the real drivers of this war from the US standpoint. This leaves question marks as to who is really driving US defence actions. Is it the Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the Defence Department/Pentagon, former Obama administration people, or Preseident Biden himself? This doesn't relate exclusively to the Biden Administration, US foreign/defence policy has been heading in this direction across previous administrations.\nWe hear about China's expansionary presence in the South China Sea, a place it has been in for more than a thousand years. A large percentage of citizens of countries around the South China sea were Chinese migrants. With the exception of China's advance across the border of Vietnam in 1979, China has not invaded any country. China's activities in its immediate region are interpreted very differently to the way Australia's strategic and defence experts are interpreting the presence (expansion), reasserting influence after a 65-year hiatus. This issue requires much more examination than was provided in the DSR.\nIn contrast, China's Pacific theatre and shipping routes are surrounded by US bases in Korea, Japan, Guam, along with a heavy naval presence ensuring 'freedom of navigation'. The US has a containment doctrine in place, which Australia subscribes to through the AUKUS nuclear powered submarine plans. Indonesia has deep reservations about AUKUS.\nUS defence competency must be questioned with the haphazard withdrawal from Afghanistan and reinhabiting of the country by elements of Al Qaida. The unchecked run of the Taliban is strengthening the Pakistan Taliban which could topple the government in Islamabad, allowing the Taliban to control Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. Iran has gained access to billions of US Dollars, which is funding Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen. Although not widely reported in the legacy media, merchant ships are being sunk by low cost Houthi missiles on a regular basis in the Gulf of Aden. The failure of US high technology weapons to keep shipping safe will require a drastic rewrite of military tactics. The US is depleting its own stockpile of weapons in Ukraine, and terrorist cells are establishing themselves in the continental the United States.\nMuch of the above could have been preventable. The soundness of current US policy should at least be discussed to ensure Australia is not harmed as a party to some future conflict unnecessarily.\nAustralia's unique issues in the region\nBeing antagonistic towards Australia's largest two-way trading partner China defies logic. We can observe and learn from the results of the Morrison government's approach to China. China trade is just too important to put at risk. In 2022-23, the two-way trade with China increased 12 percent, totalling AUD 316.9 billion. This made-up 26 percent of Australia's two-way trade with the world.\nCanberra's Anglo-orientated bureaucrats really need to learn from neighbours in the region how diplomacy could better be conducted in the region. We are no longer the 'superior' white man of the south.\nAustralia's greatest strategic threat will not be from military attack. It will most likely come from a massive natural disaster to the north. This could lead to massive casualties and exodus to the shoreline of Australia. This would happen with little warning.\nChina has already become extensively involved in the Australian economy. Now, 5.5 percent of the population in Australia are Chinese. This is an important cultural connection to China, as China sees the diaspora as overseas Chinese citizens. One of the best 'bellwethers' to measure the Australian-China relationship is the number of tourists that visit each year. When this picks up, then we will know the Australian-China relationship is becoming healthy once again.\nThese are the cultural issues that will help to prevent any mishap with China.\nMeanwhile, Australia must look at how best to defend itself in the immediate region. Submarines for coastal surveillance would be good. Nuclear powered submarines bought on the 'never-never' might not even be around when they might be needed.\nAustralia's biggest defence is diplomacy and soft power. Australia must move beyond just transactional relationships with its neighbours. Much closer relationships must be built with our neighbours, and this means integrating the military, if possible. Our best defence and also biggest threat is Indonesia.\nAustralia shouldn't be playing other nation's games. It has its own game much closer to home.\n"

    "text": "\nPHILIPPINE President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. on Wednesday said his government might hold a plebiscite on proposed changes to the 1987 Constitution alongside the 2025 midterm elections, a move that analysts said would make Charter change (“Cha-cha”) a key election issue.\nHolding the plebiscite alongside the midterm elections is cost- efficient, he told reporters before flying to Australia on Wednesday for a state visit.\n“We are studying that possibility because if we hold the election and the plebiscite separately, that would be like two polls, which would be expensive,” the President said. “Perhaps, we could do them together.”\nThe House of Representatives on Monday began deliberations on a resolution that seeks to lift foreign ownership limits on public utilities, education and advertising sectors in the Charter.\nThe Commission on Elections on Monday said it could hold the plebiscite together with the May 2025 elections, noting that there would be no additional expenses “except that we will request additional allowances for teachers.”\n“We have also designed a sample ballot with a plebiscite question. Our machines can handle a yes or no question on the ballot as well,” Comelec Chairman George Erwin M. Garcia said.\n“There’s some legal consequences because a plebiscite is slightly different from an election,” Mr. Marcos said. “If we are able to incorporate the two exercises together, as a practical matter, I think that would help.”\nIf the plebiscite is held simultaneously with the 2025 elections, “then the ‘Cha-cha’ discussions would inevitably be part of the midterm election issues,” said Jan Robert R. Go, a political science professor from the University of the Philippines (UP).\n“It could even eclipse other more important issues like inflation, livelihood and national security,” he said in a Facebook Messenger chat. “Of course, we expect politicians to say that ‘Cha-cha’ will solve larger issues.”\nJean Encinas-Franco, who also teaches political science at the UP, worries that it could divert public attention from other national concerns.\n“While it is more economical as they say, the potential impact is that it will indeed be the major electoral issue and may sideline other important and more urgent issues,” she said via Messenger chat.\nAnthony Borja, a political science professor at De La Salle University in Manila, said Charter change might become more of a concern for senatorial candidates than congressmen.\n“It will become a core issue if and only if it is effectively projected as something that would drastically affect the everyday lives of ordinary citizens,” he said via Messenger chat. “Its prominence as an issue depends on other pertinent concerns like foreign security and economic policy sans ‘Cha-cha’.”\nThe ruling coalition supportive of the President and Speaker would probably field senatorial candidates who will support their Charter change agenda, Arjan P. Aguirre, who teaches political science at Ateneo de Manila University, said via Messenger chat. “It is logical to think that the Duterte faction will support candidates who will be rejecting this move.”\nMeanwhile, Neri J. Colmenares, a former congressman, said lifting foreign ownership limits in the 1987 Constitution presents security risks because foreigners could take control of the Philippines’ power transmission.\n“If China, for example, controls our big generation and distribution utilities, a little commotion in the South China Sea and they could black out Luzon” the lawyer told the House committee of the whole. “Public service to the Filipino people becomes service to foreign stockholders.”\nThe National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP) is 60% owned by Filipino companies Monte Oro Grid Resources Corp. and Calaca High Power Corp., while the remaining 40% shares are held by the State Grid Corp. of China (SGCC).\nSenators last year considered banning foreigners from having shares in NGCP, citing security risks amid worsening tensions with China.\nMr. Colmenares said the government should instead develop local industries and businesses.\n“Foreign investment is of course an important component of any economic development but that is the secondary engine of growth,” he said. “The focus of the government [should not be] opening or liberalizing the economy but rather... on national industrialization.”\n"

    "title": "Biodiversity and Conservation of Fish in the Beibu Gulf",
    "created_at": "2024-02-29",
    "text": "\nKey words\nBiodiversity, Coral reef fish, Destructive, Mangrove, Protection, Beibu gulf\nINTRODUCTION\nFishes are the most important members of vertebrates which contribute more than 50% of the total number of living vertebrate animals (Nelson, 2006). Fishes are also one of the seriously threatened animal groups (Bruton, 1995). Fishes are very important food and biological resources to humans. The production of fisheries and aquaculture reached 1.79 × 108 tons in 2018 (FAO, 2020). Biodiversity conservation of fishes has very high ecological and economic value and is the important cornerstone for human sustainable development (Worm and Branch, 2012). Compiling an inventory of fishes in a region is the preliminary step toward biodiversity conservation and sustainable development (Mora et al., 2008; Stephenson and Stengel, 2020).\nIn the past thirty years, many researchers have paid attention to fish biodiversity in the freshwater ecosystems of continent (e.g. South America), large rivers (e.g. Yangtze River and Mekong River), and biodiversity hotspots such as Hainan Island and Leizhou Peninsula (Reis et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2003; Kang, 2013; Xiong et al., 2018a, 2019). However, some regions of marine biodiversity hotspots were overlooked or greatly underestimated, such as the Beibu Gulf.\nThe Beibu Gulf is a shared sea waters between China and Vietnam, located in the northern continental shelf of the South China Sea. Due to its geographic and climatic conditions, the Beibu Gulf has highly productive and abundant fisheries resources and is an important fishery and aquaculture sea region (Qiu et al., 2008). For better-protected fish biodiversity and fisheries resources, China government announced a fishing ban in Beibu Gulf in 1999. Although all types of fishing were forbidden by the Chinese government during the fishing moratorium periods, there were still fishing activities by the Vietnamese fishermen in the Beibu Gulf during that periods (Vu, 2013). Some researchers had surveyed fish biodiversity in the South China Sea (Qiu et al., 2008). However, information of fish biodiversity is very disrupted due to lack of unified management and research between China and Vietnam government, which limited the conservation of fish biodiversity and fishery sustainability in the Beibu Gulf.\nThe objective of this paper was to review the status of the fish community composition and diversity in the Beibu Gulf. We also examined major cause of the decline of fishes and provide the management recommendation. This study provides information about the protection and conservation of fishes in the Beibu Gulf and gives fundamental suggestions for sustainabl use of fish and fishery resources of the Beibu Gulf in the future.\nSTUDY AREA\nThe Beibu Gulf is a semi-enclosed sea area in the north of the South China Sea. The Beibu Gulf is surrounded by the China and Vietnam and located in 17°00'-21°45'N, 105°40'-110°10'E (Fig. 1). It is an area of about 1.28×105 km2. The average water depth is about 40 m, with a maximum depth being about 100 m. The climate of Beibu Gulf is subtropical maricreated_at and is dominated by monsoons, with an average temperature of 37.1°C. The average rainfall is about 1670 mm. Some rivers such as Red River, Fangcheng River, Nanliujiang River flow into the Beibu Gulf, and result in an extensive estuarine and mangrove ecosystem (Zhang et al., 2020).\nSOURCES OF FISH INFORMATION\nLiterature review was used for collecting the distribution data of fish species in the Beibu Gulf. We searched for literature that contained the following combination of words: Beibu Gulf, fishery resources, fishes in Vietnam or China, fish fauna and ichthyography in the South China Sea in the title, abstract, or keywords from google scholar ( and CNKI ( and check their sample areas (Li et al., 1987; Sun, 1990; Ye et al., 1993; Luo et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2006, 2017; Ye et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2011; Hoang and Duc, 2012; Hoang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017b; Thu et al., 2019), and collected information from some Chinese books (IOZ et al., 1962; CTCIT, 1986; Yuan et al., 1994; Jia, 2003; Muda et al., 2005; Wang, 2009; Chen 2015; Zhang et al., 2017a; Fu, 2018; He and Lai, 2013; Lai and He, 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Yu, 2019).\nTo avoid the confusion caused by synonyms and changes of common names, we validated the Latin names of each species via Catalog of Fishes database ( scientists/projects/catalog-of-fishes).\nDIVERSITY OF FISH SPECIES\nA total of 1519 fish species belonging to 42 orders, 198 families were recorded in the Beibu Gulf (Table I). The Perciformes was the order with the highest number of fish species (907 species, accounting for 59.67%) in Beibu Gulf, followed by Scorpaeniformes with 81 species, Pleuronectiformes with 71 species, Tetraodontiforme with 70 species, Anguilliformes with 66 species, Clupeiformes with 59 species. Each of the other orders possesses less than 40 fish species (Fig. 2, Table I). It is noted that 107 fish species were listed as endangered species by IUCN (Table I).\nAmong family levels, the Gobiidae, Pomacentridae, Labridae, Serranidae, Carangidae and Apogonidae are the most abundant families, containing more than 40 species and accounting for 7.82%, 4.60%, 3.68%, 3.48%, 3.35% and 2.89% of the total number of fish species in the Beibu Gulf, respectively (Fig. 3, Table I).\nIt was noted that 928 species belonging to 28 orders, 124 families and 409 genera of reef associated fishes were recorded in the Beibu Gulf (Table I). The eight most highest number of families, each with more than 20 species, and which accounted for approximately 43.71% of the total number of fish species were Gobiidae (83), Pomacentridae (70), Labridae (56), Apogonidae (44), Serranidae (36), Chaetodontidae (32), Carangidae (23), and Blenniidae \nTHREATS TO FISHES\nOverfishing\nOverfishing was one of the most important threats to ichthyological biodiversity and fishery resources in the Beibu Gulf (Dulvy et al., 2003; Yu and Mu, 2006). With the engine boats introduced in the 1960s and promoted popular in the 1980s, the fishing efforts and catches had increased sharply in the past forty years (Wang et al., 2019). Lack of precise data of fishing catches in the Beibu Gulf, some researchers estimated that fishing catch had reached 8.57 × 105 tons each year (Zou et al., 2013). Recently, some studies have shown that the fish community compositions have changed drastically in the Beibu Gulf due to overexploitation of fishing resources (Wang et al., 2019). Now, the average stock density of many important fishes have decreased less than 10% of that in the 1960s (Wang et al., 2021).\nMany traditionally commercial fish species (large size and high value), such as Epinephelus spp., Lutjanus spp. and Larimichthys crocea, have been replaced by short-lived, low trophic level and small fishes (Chen et al., 2011). For example, the biomass of piscivorous fish species has decreased to only 6% of that in the 1960s (Chen et al., 2008). Furthermore, the population of many fishes, namely Evynnis cardinalis, Saurida tumbil, S. undosquamis, Argyrosomus macrocephalus, and Nemipterus virgatus have shown miniaturization and early sexual maturity due to overexploitation (Wang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).\nAquarium trade has increased quickly and formed a multi-billion-dollar industry in the past forty years, and over 1000 marine fishes are involved in the global aquarium fish industry (Dey, 2016). However, it was totally different with freshwater ornamental fishes, over 90% them of which are farmed (Evers et al., 2019), the vast majority of marine fishes were caught from wild (King, 2019). It is known that Beibu Gulf supported the high biodiversity of coral reef fishes (Arai, 2015). The most important export region was Asia, which accounts for over half of the global market for aquarium fish. Both China and Vietnam were important exports of aquarium trade in Asia. Many coral fishes were captured for the aquarium trade (Arai, 2015).\nA great number of coral reef fish species, such as Chaetodon octofasciatus, C. auripes, C. lunulatus, C. melannotus, C. speculum, C. wiebeli, C. modestus, C. baronessa, C. triangulum, C. trifascialis, C. auriga, C. lineolatus, C. adiergastos, and C. lunula, were captured for aquarium purposes in Beibu Gulf.\nMany fish species were traded as traditional Chinese medicines. There were over 60 fish species in the Beibu Gulf (Rhincodon typus, Halaelurus buergeri, Hippocampus histrix, Mustelus griseus, etc., Table I) are listed in the Chinese traditional medicines (SCSO, 1978). For example, seahorses (Syngnathidae) were rare traditional medicines in China, although some small-scale culture of seahorses occurred in Southern China. The farmers did not have enough knowledge of biology and breeding technology of seahorse, hence these small seahorse farms eventually were closed. The seahorse medicine now came from field capture. Now, all seahorse have been listed on the CITES (IUCN website, 2021).\nHabitat destruction\nThe mangroves, coral reef, and seagrass habitats located in the Beibu Gulf (Wang et al., 2021), provided a wide range of habitat to support high diversity of fishes (Table I). However, some important habitats of fishes were destroyed for aquaculture, because of the port and other human utilizations. The mangrove areas have decreased leading to the loss of over one third of shrimp ponds in Leizhou Peninsula (Lei et al., 2022). In the past thirty years, the Beibu Gulf has become one of the busiest shipping regions of the world, and over half of the oil tankers and commercial ships sail through this sea region (Wang et al., 2021). Fangcheng port, which was the largest port in west China, planned to establish over 50.3 km shoreline and over 200 deep water berths. These large-scale human constructions had destroyed many important habitats of fish (Lei et al., 2022).\nFinally, the stocks of many important commercial fishes, including L. sanguineus, Therapon theraps, Gerres filamentosus, Carcharhinus menisorrah and Gymnocranius griseus have decreased quickly (Yu and Mu, 2006).\nPollution and eutrophication\nPollution had caused significant changes in the structure and function of bioresources (phytoplankton, zooplankton) and fish communities in marine and coastal ecosystems (Islam and Tanaka, 2004). Recently, some studies have focused on different forms of pollution (e.g. heavy metal, organic pollutant, microplastics) in the Beibu Gulf (Kaiser et al., 2016; Koongolla et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Meanwhile, large number of nutrient imports in Beibu Gulf due to urban extension have resulted in aquaculture pollution and other human disturbances (Xiong et al., 2018a; 2019). These overloaded nutrients caused eutrophication and harmful algal blooms and eventually fish mortality as hypoxia and toxic compounds (Xiong et al., 2018a, 2019).\nNon-native species\nChina waters have recently been found to be threatened with non-native aquatic species (Xiong et al., 2015, 2017; Wang et al., 2016). For developing aquaculture, a great number of non-native species have been introduced into China (Lin et al., 2015). The Beibu Gulf is an important aquaculture and fishery catch region of China (Kang et al., 2018) which provided large-scale aquaculture of some non-native species (Xiong et al., 2018a, 2019; Wang et al., 2021). For example, the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), introduced for aquaculture in the surrounding regions of Beibu Gulf got widely distributed and caused great threat to native biodiversity (Xiong et al., 2018b, c; Lin et al., 2020). In order to improve the production and quality of aquaculture, more and more non-native species will have to be introduced into the Beibu Gulf in the future (Wang et al., 2021).\nThe Beibu Gulf is the station of origin of the maricreated_at silk road. Now, Guangxi Beibu Gulf Port has built a total of 256 productive berths, which could berth ships of up to 2.00×105 tons, and its routes are been able to reach more than 100 countries in the world, with direct access to more than 200 ports in the world (Qin, 2017). Now, the Beibu Gulf has become the busiest waterway in the world. \nOver half of the oil tankers and commercial ships pass through the Beibu Gulf every year (Wang et al., 2014). Inevitably, some non-native species were introduced in the Beibu Gulf by the ballast water of the ship (Wang et al., 2021), and some non-native species, such as algae (Alexandrum catenclla, and Scrippsiella trochoidea) had been distributed large scale and formed red tide, which caused a great number fish to die because of lack of oxygen (Wang et al., 2021).\nRecently, aquarium became the most important introduction pathway of non-native aquatic species in China (Xiong et al., 2015, 2017; Wang et al., 2016). We could buy non-native species for aquarium in some cities around the Beibu Gulf, such as Beihai, Fangchenggang (Wang et al., 2021). Many non-native fishes such as Xenostrobus securis, Glossogobius giuris, Hemichromis bimaculatus, Hippichthys spicifer, and Poecilia velifera were very popular aquarium species in the world. Thus, countries around the Beibu Gulf (China, Vietnam) cultivated a great number of non-native species, including fishes, crayfish, shellfish (Wang et al., 2021). Inevitably, some non-native fishes had escaped and found suitable habitats in the Beibu Gulf. For example, jewelfish (H. bimaculatus) had became one of the most widely distributed non-native species in the wetlands around the Beibu Gulf (Xiong et al., 2018a, 2019).\nCONSERVATION\nFish biodiversity and fisheries resource is of high economic and ecological conservation significance in the Beibu Gulf. Firstly, fish was the most important protein source for about 2.7 hundred million people (92.7 million in Vietnam and 174 million in China) living in the coastal of Beibu Gulf. Secondly, Beibu Gulf provide diverse habitats (mangroves, seagrass, Coral reef, shelf, estuaries), with high biodiversity and endemism (Liu, 2013).\nThe establishment of protected areas was an effective measurement for fish biodiversity conservation (Xiong et al., 2018a, 2019). However, there were only a few marine protected areas that covered quite small area of the Beibu Gulf (Trung et al., 2014). In addition, the different life-history stages of many fishes inhabited different habitats, such as mangroves-seagrass-coral reef (Kimirei et al., 2011). Thus, the establishment of marine protected areas should cover not only important fish habitats (such as mangroves, seagrass, Coral reef) but also the connecting galleries among these habitats (Sambrook et al., 2019). Therefore, more and larger protected areas should be been stablished in the Beibu Gulf covering important fish habitats and connecting galleries in the future.\nTable I.

resource, China government had announced fishing ban in Beibu Gulf since 1999 (June 1-August 1 from 1999-2003, June 1-August 1 from 2004-2016; May 1-August 16 from 2017). In the fishing ban period, all forms of fishing were not allowed in the Beibu Gulf. However, some Vietnamese fishermen still continued their fishing activities during the period of fishing ban in the Beibu Gulf (Vu, 2013). The effects of fishing ban caused tensions between China and Vietnam (Vu, 2013). Therefore, we hope the government of China and Vietnam to take more co-operations to consolidated created_at quantum and scope in the Beibu Gulf.\nThe biological information (biology, ecology, distribution, and life-history) of many fish was lack, which was limited to the scientific management of bioresources and fisheries sustainability. Especially some migratory fish species (including anadromous, catadromous, and mangroves seagrass Coral reef fishes) spend partial life history in different habitats. These migratory fishes should have been paid more attention. A great number of studies have been funded by China's Belt and Road initiative. However, few studies focused on conservation of fish biodiversity and fishery sustainability in the Beibu Gulf. We call on more international cooperation of fishery scholars among China, Vietnam and other ASEAN countries.\nCONCLUSIONS\nA rich diversity of fish species has been observed in the Beibu Gulf, with about 107 fish species are endangered species (Table 1). However, overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and non-native species are main threat to fish biodiversity and sustainable utilization of fish resources in the Beibu Gulf. Therefore, more international cooperation about protected areas, fishing bans, and scientific researches should be implemented for effective protecting fish biodiversity and fisheries resource sustainability.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe are grateful to the three anonymous referees for their helpful comments on previous drafts of this paper.

    "text": "\nNew Delhi, Feb. 29 -- As year-end 2023 looms, a transient lull in India's endemic election fever may permit the media a respite to focus on other matters of serious national concern. The voting citizen, given his or her preoccupation with pressing issues such as jobs, prices, health and social harmony, may not see national security, for example, as a priority issue. But she should, because paying cursory attention to security threats - internal as well as external - will only aggravate them, and divert the nation's attention and scarce resources away from development and social welfare. Former Army chief, General MM Naravane, in his forthcoming memoir, highlights this with his recall of a serious security issue warranting a cabinet decision being handed to him as a \"hot potato\" in 2020. Around us, we see a rapidly fragmenting landscape where schisms are breeding mutual hostility. If the Russia-Ukraine war served to widen the East-West divide, the Israel- Hamas conflict in Gaza has angered the Global South, which sees the West as guilty of hypocrisy, double standards and abetting genocide. As the world helplessly watches these brutal and sanguinary conflicts rage, the organs of the UN seem to have been rendered impotent and irrelevant.\nThis is, perhaps, the state of international anarchy that aspiring hegemon China has been waiting so that it can use its economic strength and coercive military power to \"restore order and stability\". After all, China's President Xi Jinping's cherished \"China Dream\" does envisage the establishment of a new world order, governed by the concept of \"tianxia\" (all under heaven), in which China will dominate by virtue of its acknowledged superiority.\nManifestations of \"tianxia\" are obvious in China's outrageous claims under the \"nine-dash line\" in the South China Sea, and repudiation of the 1914 McMahon line on the India-China border. As far as India is concerned, burgeoning trade apart, in every other aspect of the bilateral relationship, China has displayed open and deep-rooted hostility.\nWhat started off as a stand- off between Chinese and Indian militaries along the Line of Actual Control three years ago has become a permanent posture. After 22 meetings of the special representatives and 20 military commanders, it is clear that a revanchist China is neither going to \"de-escalate\" nor restore the territorial \"status quo ante\" (whatever that means). For India, to downplay the ever present dangers inherent in living with such a hostile neighbour would be imprudent.\nThe ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza are as different as they can be, but both battlefields are seeing old paradigms being discarded and the deployment of new concepts, technologies and innovations. One hopes that our armed forces, even as they struggle with a radical new recruitment system while extracting military wisdom from ancient Indian texts, and exorcising the ghosts of a \"colonial legacy\", will also devote adequate attention to the lessons of the current wars.\nThe East European conflict holds special interest for India because the military hardware deployed in combat by Russia and Ukraine also serves our forces. But what should provoke serious introspection in the Global South are the conclusions drawn by a Swedish think tank from a study of the Russia-Ukraine war. Pointing out the obvious fact that none of the immediate goals of its \"special operation\" on 24 February 2022, were achieved by Russia, it infers that this spectacular failure, apart from other reasons, is attributable to the absence of a joint command structure and a concept of joint operations in Russia.\nThe war commenced with Russian commanders conducting operations independently. It was only eight months later that a joint HQ was created and General Sergey Surovikin was given command of \"integrated forces,\" a hitherto unknown text. After three months, Surovikin was replaced by General Gerasimov (till then chief of general staff), who was subsequently re-assigned \"to organise closer coordination between military branches and services\"; a goal that should have been achieved long before the war. One of the main reasons for Russia's military failure, the study says, is \"the desire to preserve the archaic military culture at any cost.\"\nBack home, the process of defence reform and initiating jointness appears to have stalled. In the four years since the institution of a Chief of Defence Staff (and 22 years since LK Advani's group of ministers recommended urgent defence reforms), little substantive change has taken place in India's outdated higher defence organisation.\nAny conflict with China will require forces/resources to be withdrawn from across India's 14 Army, Navy and Air Force commands scattered all over the country. Facing this composite force, will be China's integrated western theatre command under its unitary commander. Our military learnt many bitter lessons during the 1987-90 tri- service Indian Peace Keeping Force operations in Sri Lanka, where issues related to inter-service coordination, command control, and logistics, led to many fiascos.\nIf the same fiascos are to be avoided, the obvious imperative is to reorganise these 14 commands into four or five \"theatres\", on geographic or threat- based considerations, and place land/ maricreated_at/air forces, as required, under the commander, charged with the conduct of operations.\nHowever, such has been the internal resistance to issues related to \"jointness\" and theatre commands that this reorganisation has remained stalled for over two decades. It is no longer a secret that apart from concerns about loss of \"turf\" and In the photo above is Admiral equitable sharing of senior posts, the main impediment to implementation of reforms has been inter-service disagreement over the employment of air power. While the IAF insists that air power is \"indivisible\" and must only be deployed under its control, the other two services want the \"air warriors\" to loosen their grip on air power assets and agree to modalities for sharing them with theatre commanders so that they can fight land and maricreated_at campaigns successfully.\nMoreover, while \"indivisibility of air power\" may have been an acceptable construct in the past, it is no longer valid because the Navy, Army and Coast Guard too deploy sizeable aviation components in service specific roles. However, there is no overlap/conflict of roles since the IAF's 2022 doctrine lists its main \"objectives\" as defence of national air space, prosecution of offensive air operations, war prevention through deterrence, and provision of assistance in internal security.\nEven as this vexed issue awaits resolution, the situation is likely to be further complicated by IAF's reported proposal that the service be renamed as \"Indian Air and Space Force\" with consequential re-allocation of charters and resources. Inter-service \"turf battles\" are not unique to India and have been fought amongst services in the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere, in the face of defence reforms. In each case, however, practical compromises invariably emerged with the forceful intervention of enlightened politicians.\nCan we hope for the dawning of realisation at the political level that further procrastination could impose a heavy price in terms of national security?\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Vayu Aerospace & Defence Review.

    "created_at": "2024-02-29",
    "text": "\nMr Chairman,\n1 Thank you for all the contributions, questions, and suggestions from Members of Parliament. Again this year, I was struck by the fact that the speeches from Opposition, Nominated, and PAP Members of Parliament were entirely fungible. I do not take that consensus for granted and I express my gratitude on behalf of all my staff for your support for MFA. I hope it is not just because MFA has regained its position as the lowest cost ministry in the Government Budget this year. Let me start by making three points.First, the world has become an even more dangerous place. \nIf you look at the situation over the last couple of years, it has progressively become more dangerous. Thesecondpoint, foreign policy begins at home. Domestic unity, cohesion, and consensus within and outside this House are essential for us to conduct effective foreign policy.Thethirdpoint is that our foreign policy must continue to be based on a realistic assessment of our national interests and vulnerabilities. It cannot be driven by sencreated_atnt, emotion, or even affinities with external groups. Let me emphasise this. When we pledge ourselves as one united people, regardless of race, language, or religion, the MFA dimension to that pledge is that when we engage with foreign countries or foreign citizens, we must also do so regardless of race, language or religion, no matter how close our hearts and affinities are. This is a point that we need to bear in mind.\nA Dangerous World\n2 Let me expand on the dangerous world. Last year, I spoke of a \"perfect storm of multiple interlocking crises\". I was referring to contestation between the US and China, the Russia-Ukraine war, climate change, global economic disruptions, and the erosion of multilateralism.\n3 Today, the situation is worse. The war between Russia and Ukraine is headed into its third year, and the meat grinder - the casualties - mount on both sides, and there is no end in sight. Tensions between the US and China have calmed somewhat at a tactical level, but the deep strategic rivalry and lack of strategic trust continues apace. The bifurcation, or what some people would call decoupling or more euphemistically de-risking, of global supply chains continues. That unravelling is continuing apace. This type of situation is particularly worrisome for Singapore because, after all, the US and China are our major strategic investment and trading partners. The lack of strategic trust between them means that the risk of miscalculations that could easily spiral into a larger conflict cannot be discounted, especially over flashpoints like Taiwan and the South China Sea.Thethreat of climate change continues. I think 2023 was the hottest year on record for the past 174 years. We also stand on the precipice of a technological and economic revolution with the advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (A.I.), and even the possibility of artificial general intelligence and its impact on jobs.\n4 Mr Chairman, the tragic conflict between Israel and Hamas is the latest addition to this litany of woes. Given the appalling humanitarian tragedy, this conflict has quite understandably elicited a very strong response from both the international community, as well as Singaporeans from all walks of life, from all our communities. It has ignited a debate over Singapore's foreign policy and how we should respond as a country. Indeed, in this contested, fragmented, and dangerous world, events in many faraway places over which we have absolutely no control will often have a profound impact on our economy; and in fact, somecreated_ats put our domestic cohesion to the test.\nForeign Policy Principles\n5 Let me come back to first principles. Singapore's foreign policy is based on several fundamental objectives.Firstand foremost, to protect our independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.Second, to secure our access to essential supplies - energy, water, food - and to keep air and sea lines of communication open. This is existential for us.Third, to expand economic opportunities and maintain our relevance to the world. Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Chong Kee Hiong have emphasised this. I want to quote Mr Lee Kuan Yew in a speech he gave at the S. Rajaratnam Lecture in 2009. Mr Lee said, \"We have to live with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. We must remain nimble to seize opportunities that come with changing circumstances, or to get out of harm's way\". We are a small country with no hinterland, no natural resources, and in fact, no intrinsic relevance. We have to make our relevance to the world. We have an open and trade-based economy that will always be vulnerable to external forces and trends. We remain a multiracial, multireligious, and multilingual society in the heart of Southeast Asia.\n6 To ensure our best chance for survival, there are a few things that we have to keep doing.First, we have to advocate for a rules-based order and full respect for international law. This is not an ideological position; this is a practical response. It is the only way that small states will have a chance to live in peace without the constant spectre of invasion from bigger neighbours. This House has just passed the Budget for the Ministry of Defence, and I stand in full support of that because as Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen said last night: we do not expect anyone to come to our rescue to shed their blood for us. In fact, I can even add, I do not think we can bank on any superpower exercising their right of veto at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on our behalf. We are on our own. Sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity is and must be sacrosanct for Singapore. What this means is being prepared to stand to stand up and call out all violations of international law whenever and wherever it happens, even if it displeases some of our stakeholders, partners, or even neighbours.This is why we opposed Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We remain, in fact, the only Southeast Asian nation to even have sanctions in place against Russia for that egregious act. We also spoke out against the American intervention in Grenada in 1983. On a more sensitive point closer to home, we opposed the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978. The reason we took those positions was not because we like to stand up and stake out a position. But if we had stayed quiet, we would have implicitly agreed that might makes right and that powerful states can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what we must. This goes against the very principles that undergird our existence as a sovereign independent city-state.\n7 But today, we are witnessing the erosion of multilateralism. We are seeing less cooperation across the world, less unity on the global stage, and less ability for the world to respond to planetary problems. In its place, we are witnessing the rise of nationalism, xenophobia, protectionism, fragmentation, and in the political arena, frankly, populism. This is inimical to Singapore domestically and globally. In fact, if you reflect upon the almost six decades of our independence, we have been beneficiaries of a rules-based integrated global economy. This has been one of the key dynamos for our success.\n8 International legal frameworks like the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea protects the right of all states to freedom of navigation and overflight and to maintain open sea routes and sea lines of communication. These are vital to Singapore. This is why Mr Vikram Nair raised the issue of the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. We are not taking sides, but if anyone - state or non-state - for whatever excuse or pretext interdicts maricreated_at safety and maricreated_at navigation, it affects Singapore. Members of this House may need to be reminded of our basic geography that if you cannot navigate through the Suez Canal and Red Sea, if that route is closed, then the shortest route between Europe and Asia around the Cape of Good Hope is not the Straits of Malacca. You have to go further south and through the Sunda Strait. Again, I am trying to make the point that we take a position for our long-term national interests. That is why we contributed personnel to the multinational Operation Prosperity Guardian to protect freedom of navigation and key sea lines of communication in response to what we assessed to be unlawful attacks on commercial shipping by the Houthis.This is about upholding principles and not about taking sides.\n9 Second, we must make common cause with as many partners around the world as possible. That means we will work with all countries on the basis of sovereign equality, mutual respect, and mutual benefit. To do this, we need to always bring value to the table. My job as Foreign Minister is so much easier because I stand on the foundations laid by the pioneer generation, who showed the world that we would stand up, would not flinch, and would defend Singapore's national interests. We would add value, act transparently and honestly, could be relied upon to be honest brokers. That has opened the door for today's generation of diplomats. We also make sure that in any diplomatic conference, the Singaporean diplomats would be the most well-briefed, most erudite, most persuasive, and the most constructive people in the room. Another big advantage that makes my job so much easier is that when any Singaporean Minister or diplomat takes a stand on the international stage, it has been coordinated. He speaks not for himself or for MFA, but for the whole of Government and the whole of Singapore. This is the way we have conducted foreign policy over decades and how we have achieved a certain branding and reputation for being consistent, constructive, and to look for \"win-win\" outcomes on the basis of mutual respect. So we have made a difference and are continuing to make a difference on the international stage, whether it is frontier issues like Generative AI, climate change, digital economy, new energy, or sustainability. These same habits and attributes keep recurring. That is why we must continue to be a credible and honest partner, especially and even in the face of great power rivalry. Many people ask us about the US and China. Implicit in their comment or question is \"Which side would you take?\" I have to keep reiterating that we will not become anyone's cat's paw or pawn or Trojan horse. We will be useful, but we will not be used by any other power. We will look at issues, as and when they arise, dispassionately and will always choose on the basis of Singapore's long-term national interests. That means, from created_at to created_at, we will face pressure from countries, almost always bigger than us, who want us to bend to their will or at least to endorse their positions. But we will need to stand firm and be prepared from created_at to created_at to say \"no\", not in a gratuitous and provocative way, but because they know that we have done our own calculations, and we take a stand based on our assessment of our long-term national interests. There is no point putting pressure on Singaporean Ministers and diplomats. If anything, we will dig in and hold the line even firmer. This makes us relevant and gives us a degree of respect and ability to contribute on the global stage.\n10 These are principles that have always guided our dealings with powers and partners. This has enabled us to maintain good and significant equities with both the US, China, Russia, Europe, and all the middle emerging powers like Australia, India, and regions like Africa and South America. This year, we celebrated the 30thanniversary of the Suzhou Industrial Park - our first Government-to-Government project with China. This year is also the 20thanniversary of the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA), the first FTA the US signed with an Asian country. We continue to reinforce our status as a trusted partner to both superpowers, even as we find new areas to deepen our cooperation. It is important to be able to do that even while the two superpowers do not get along, do not have strategic trust, and have not yet reached a modus vivendi. We are trying to deepen cooperation and maintain separate relationships with them that are still based on trust. I hope you can understand and appreciate the nature of that diplomatic challenge. Of course, we will continue to prioritise our relations with our neighbours, especially our two immediate neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as with ASEAN, and with regional players and the emerging middle powers. I will leave Second Minister Maliki and SMS Sim Ann to give you more details on this later.\nForeign Policy Begins at Home\n11 Let me come back to foreign policy beginning at home. I have already mentioned the essential need for domestic cohesion and unity. This is absolutely essential and existential. If we cannot be united at home, how do we face the outside world with all its dangers, challenges, and risks? At independence, we were a society riddled with racial and religious fault-lines. Our forefathers overcame this by setting aside their differences. Not erasing them; those differences are still there, but making sure they did not become a source of internal tension and conflict. Our pioneer generation chose to put Singapore and Singaporeans first. They worked together for the collective good, to build not a Malay nation, or a Chinese nation, or an Indian nation. They chose to build a nation that all of us equally could call home.But this is always work in progress.Our ethnic identities, our legacies, our connections are still useful for maintaining friendships, and for establishing and expanding business connections. But fundamentally, even as we parley our multilingual, multicultural, and multireligious ability, we must remember to look at issues and respond as Singaporeans first. Every created_at I go to the Great Hall of the People in Beijing or the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi, I am always reminded that if my great grandparents had not left India or China, I would not be there as a guest of India or China. Then I look around at my delegation and look at the faces, and I always point out to my interlocutors that we are multiracial, multilingual, and multireligious. I speak on behalf of Singapore and Singaporeans, not as an Indian, or Chinese, or Malay, or on the basis of my religious identity. I am reminded of that every created_at I go the White House, or any palace or Istana in the world. This is the way we have to continue dealing with all countries. Both those whom we have good and friendly relations with and those whom we may temporarily have perhaps a little bit of tension with because of disagreements on issues. The point is thatexternal issues and events will always have the potential to sow disagreement amongst us. It is hardcoded into our identity. Our diversity is both a strength and challenge. The same windows of opportunity also serve as windows for discord. This is not a bug but a design feature of Singapore. So long as we remember that we must not allow centrifugal pressures to threaten our harmony and cohesion, we can continue to take advantage of our diversity. Itis both a defining strength and a potential source ofdivision. A variety of opinions is healthy and it provides a foundation upon which we can make collective decisions as a country. But remember that we must always find that middle ground. Make the compromises. Arrive at the consensus. The moment we fracture, we are irrelevant.\n12 External issues can certainly polarise us. Russia's war with Ukraine was a precursor, a preamble for us. We took a position to condemn Russia's invasion because it was a clear violation of international law. But there were competing narratives that were opposed to the position we took. They wanted us to choose a side instead of upholding principles. The war in Ukraine had significant economic impact. It certainly affected the price of energy, fertilisers, and food. We felt it. It was part of the story of inflation around the world. But, actually, did not have all that much emotional resonance. Given our makeup, the sense of affinity or identity was much less. But now, let us get real. The next episode - what is happening in Gaza. The Israel-Hamas conflict may actually have less economic impact, but it has got a very major emotional impact. We should recognise that. The fighting in Gaza has resulted in a humanitarian crisis that is appalling.Anyone with a heart must ache with every picture, every video, every news report you read. Far too many innocent lives have been lost or maimed forever. The conflict in the Middle East is a complicated one. It goes back decades, centuries or even thousands of years. It is chronic, difficult, painful, tragic, and enormously difficult to resolve problem. What happened on 7 October 2023 - and I know I have had this debate with the Leader of the Opposition before.We had to condemn that specific episode when Hamas launched an attack on civilians and took hostages. This was a blatant and abhorrent act of terrorism which cannot be justified by any circumstance, context, historical reason or justification. Why are we so obsessed with calling out terrorism wherever we see it without any excuses, pretext, or justification? The reason we take this stand is not because we are taking sides, correcting history, or rewriting history. We cannot. We are talking about a conflict of thousands of years while we are only a country of 59 years. We have taken a categorical stand because terrorism is a clear and present threat to Singapore. To excuse terrorism now, for whatever reason, puts Singapore at risk. Every created_at I read about rockets being fired, or an insurgent force killing, maiming, raping civilians, or taking hostages, my thoughts were not so much in Gaza. Instead, I was thinking about what would happen if rockets landed in Bukit Panjang, if an insurgent force entered Woodlands, if 1,200 Singaporeans were killed, if 200 Singaporeans were kidnapped. That is what I was thinking. When I say that foreign policy begins at home, I tell you that your Foreign Minister spends more created_at thinking about what if that happened in Singapore. What would we need to say, what would we need to do, what would be the job of diplomats, especially our Permanent Representative in New York, especially if we had to face the UN Security Council (UNSC). I hope you understand why we have to be so categorical at created_ats like this, even though we know it is an emotionally fraught moment.\n13 After the 7 October attacks, we said we recognised Israel's right to self-defence. It is not because I was thinking of Israel or taking sides. We recognised Israel's right to self-defence because we will assert Singapore's right to self-defence if we ever faced a situation like that. Have no doubt about that. It is not just our right to self-defence but I think Members of this House would agree that it is our duty is to protect our citizens.But even as we say that there is a right to self-defence, we have consistently insisted that Israel must comply with international humanitarian law. Israel's conduct must abide by the principles of necessity and proportionality. Israel must comply with the laws of war, including the principles of distinction and humanity enshrined in the Geneva Conventions.\n14 Unfortunately, Israel's military response has gone too far. For avoidance of ambiguity, I am going to repeat that line. Israel's military response has gone too far. The catastrophic situation in Gaza demands an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to alleviate the unbearable suffering of the civilian victims and to enable humanitarian assistance to reach them immediately. We are also concerned that there may be a potential ground offensive into Rafah which will only worsen the situation further. We have made our position clear, both in my conversations with Israel and all our Arab friends and partners, and at the UN. We voted for the two UN General Assembly resolutions on the \"Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations\" which called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.\n15 Some people have told me - that is not enough. We want you to sever diplomatic ties with Israel and recall our ambassador; engage in other performative diplomatic actions. I need to tell everyone that we manage our international relations by remaining engaged with the international community and maintaining ties with as many countries as possible that are willing to maintain ties with us. As a small country, this is in our national interest. Ceremonially breaking ties with countries every created_at we disapprove of their actions, in my view, is not constructive. Whatever we say or do diplomatically will not change the situation on the ground. Nor will it influence Israel to suddenly change its policy or will it necessarily immediately reduce the suffering of the Palestinians. None of the Five Permanent Members of the UNSC have broken diplomatic ties with Israel. Even the Arab countries like Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan continue to have diplomatic relations with Israel. I checked last night during a phone call. While the Ambassadors may or may not be present, their staff are present and their embassies are open and functional. Neither have ASEAN countries like Thailand, the Philippines or Vietnam broken off relations or closed their embassies in Tel Aviv.\n16 Ms Rachel Ong asked how Singapore's relations with Israel would be impacted by the position that we have taken on the conflict. Clearly, they know that our position is not identical to theirs. I would say that we have been able to maintain good and respectful relations with the state of Israel. But I would also say that we have good and equally respectful relations with the Palestinian Authority. All sides know that Singapore will always speak our mind, not provocatively, but because these are dearly held principles that we uphold. We will continue to maintain these positions guided by Singapore's long-term national interests and our unique circumstances. Whether or not you agree or disagree with us, it is not personal. It is a carefully considered national position. Quite frankly, I have never had to get into any shouting matches or disagreeable phone calls with any other foreign minister, regardless of circumstances. It is not because I am such an erudite and charming man, but because I am just the latest, current Foreign Minister of Singapore, behaving true to form and holding fast to principles that have stood the test of created_at.\n17 I want to make one more point about the Israel-Hamas conflict. As I have said just now, this is a longstanding conflict with a complicated history. But it is worth emphasising that this is not a religious battle. Religion is actually a veneer covering the heart of the conflict. What is the heart of the conflict? It is an age-old conflict, a fight over land, identity, and power. This is an issue that goes back a very long created_at. In fact not just by tradition, and not just because they all claim Abraham to be their father, but even the latest genetic data. The Israelis and Palestinians are both Semitic tribes who have been fighting over this same sliver of land for such a long created_at. It is not possible for outsiders like us, no matter how we feel or do not feel about their identity, culture, and religion, it is not possible for Singaporeans to decide or determine who is right or who has a stronger historical claim. This long-drawn fight has been a tragedy, but this is only the latest chapter of a long saga of tragedy. Our hearts quite rightly ache at the bloodshed but it is essential for Singaporeans to understand and appreciate that this is not our quarrel. While we may feel a diversity of emotions on this, the worst thing would be to let this quarrel polarise and divide us as Singaporeans.\n18 Both Israel and Palestine have a right to exist. Israel has a right to live peacefully within secure borders, but the Palestinian people also have a right to a homeland. This is why, way back in 1988, we welcomed the proclamation of a Palestinian state.\n19 We are under no illusions that the path to an enduring peace will be easy. There is so much distrust and animosity, and recent events have only made things worse. For what it is worth, I tell all our friends and partners in the Middle East that Singapore continues to believe that a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with UNSC Resolutions 242 and 338, is the only possible basis for durable peace. Anything else will just condemn them to repeating the cycles of violence and tragedy. We have consistently expressed our support for a two-state solution at the UN. We have consistently opposed moves that undermine a two-state solution in Israel and Palestine. For example, we view Israel's settlements in the West Bank as illegal under international law and we think that proceeding with the way that they have proceeded over the last couple of decades, after the failure of the Oslo Accords, will only make things worse. It makes it much more difficult to arrive at a two-state solution. We have voted in favour of every UN resolution that calls on Israel to rescind unilateral measures to change the status of Jerusalem. Not because we have a view on how to settle the Jerusalem question, but because we believe this can only be done through direct negotiations between the two semitic tribes - the Palestinians and the Israelis - directly arriving at a consensus, however long and difficult that will be.\n20 Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked how we have contributed to the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Singaporeans have contributed generously with humanitarian assistance. Singaporean NGOs and the Government have raised more than S$10 million for relief operations to Gaza so far and I am confident more will follow. Our strong ties with partners in the Middle East have allowed us to collaborate with them on the delivery of this aid. So far, we have sent two tranches of life-saving aid for the civilians in Gaza. Minister Maliki was in Cairo in early November last year to personally hand over the first tranche to the Egyptian Red Crescent. A few weeks later, we sent a second tranche that was delivered directly to Al Arish, an airport in Egypt, near the Egypt-Gaza border.This was delivered by an RSAF aircraft. In January 2024, we also sent an SAF medical team to serve onboard a French Navy ship to treat casualties from Gaza.\n21 I spoke to the Jordanian Foreign Minister last night. We have agreed that we will donate a third tranche of aid for Gaza and this created_at we will work through Jordan. We will also continue our long-standing support for the Palestinian Authority's capacity building efforts through our $10 million Enhanced Technical Assistance Package (ETAP). As I said before, we have good ties with the Palestinian Authority. Prime Minister Lee, Senior Minister Teo, Minister Maliki, and I have visited Ramallah on multiple occasions. We have met our counterparts there. Even during this crisis, I have been in phone contact with the Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister. We do all this because we look forward to the day when there is peace and a functioning, capable Palestinian state, and that the Palestinian people get the peace and progress which they so richly deserve. I mentioned earlier that we have also established a representative office in Ramallah in 2022.\n22 I appreciate that many Singaporeans feel deeply about what is happening in Gaza.But I also hope you can understand my point that foreign policy cannot be driven one way or the other by sencreated_atnt or affinity to any external group. Our foreign policy must be based on understanding our core interests and acting consistently in accordance with the principles that safeguard our independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security.\n23 Looking ahead, because of the state of the world, there are going to be many more foreign policy issues that are difficult, sensitive, prickly, and controversial. The Israel-Hamas war is just the latest chapter. Can you imagine if there is a war between the US and China, or India and China, or between our neighbours, or in the South China Sea? Then it will not just be economics or just emotion. Everything will come to bear at the same created_at, both the economic and the emotional impact. If that happens, if Singapore splits, polarises, or divides on the basis of affinity, history, identity, race, language, or religion, we will be sunk. Singapore will be divided, weaker, and vulnerable. We will not be independent; we will not have autonomy. I am very glad that our community and religious leaders have tried to help our people better understand the conflict. This is a very dangerous and difficult exercise but it is an essential exercise. Where else in the world can you see the Chief Rabbi and the Mufti come together in the immediate aftermath of a horrendous attack and catastrophic response, in a public display of solidarity, to call for stronger bonds between the Jewish and Muslim communities, and express their hopes and prayers for long-term peace. The Mufti and Chief Rabbi have both come in for criticism. They are brave and principled people and they have stood up, not just for their communities, but have made Singapore a stronger, safer and better place. This is a wonderful example of Singapore unity, cohesion, and compassion at its best.\n24 Let me end again by quoting Mr Lee Kuan Yew.He said this in 1967 when speaking to some university students: \"We must be realistic. We cannot afford to indulge in emotional outbursts or in wishful thinking. We must face the hard facts of life and deal with them rationally and objectively\". Mr Chair, we have tried in MFA, and all our diplomats, to abide by this.\n"

    "created_at": "2024-03-01",
    "text": "\n2024 FEB 01 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Science Daily -- A new study on Science - Geoscience is now available. According to news reporting originating from Utrecht, Netherlands, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The South China, Indochina, and Borneo margins surrounding the South China Sea contain long-lived arcs that became inactive at approximately 85 Ma, even though an embayment of oceanic crust (the 'Proto-South China Sea') remained in the intervening region. This oceanic crust eventually subducted in the Cenozoic below Borneo and the Cagayan arc, while the modern South China Sea opened in its wake.\" \n Funders for this research include Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Open Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Marine Geology (Tongji University). \n Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the University of Utrecht, \"To investigate the enigmatic cessation of Mesozoic subduction below South China and Borneo, we studied a fragment of oceanic crust and overlying trench-fill sediments that accreted to NW Borneo during the final stages of Paleo-Pacific subduction. Based on radiolarian biostratigraphy of cherts overlying the pillow basalts and detrital zircon geochronology of the trench-fill, we constrained the minimum age of the oceanic crust during accretion to 40 Ma. This shows that subduction cessation was not related to ridge subduction. Geochemical analysis of pillow basalts revealed an enriched mid-ocean ridge basalt signature comparable to oceanic plateaus. Using paleomagnetism, we show that this fragment of oceanic crust was not part of the Izanagi Plate but was part of a plate (the 'Pontus' Plate) separated from the Izanagi Plate by a subduction zone. Based on the minimum 40 Ma age of the oceanic crust and its geochemistry, we suggest that Mesozoic subduction below South China and Borneo stopped when an oceanic plateau entered the trench, while the eastern plate margin with the Izanagi Plate remained active.\" \n According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"We show how our findings offer opportunities to restore plate configurations of the Panthalassa-Tethys junction region.\" \n For more information on this research see: Causes of Cretaceous Subduction Termination Below South China and Borneo: Was the Proto-south China Sea Underlain By an Oceanic Plateau?

    "title": "What's behind the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act?",
    "created_at": "2024-03-01",
    "text": "\nBy Ding Duo | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2024-03-01 19:23\nRecently, the Philippine Senate passed the amendment to the Marine Zones Act (S. No. 2492) in the third reading, which was unanimously passed by the Philippine House of Representatives in 2023. The Philippines has been preparing for a long created_at, saying that its main purpose is to further clarify the \"maricreated_at boundaries\" and provide a \"legal basis\" for the exercise of exclusive jurisdiction over the claimed maricreated_at areas, based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (the UNCLOS) and the South China Sea Arbitration Award (the \"Arbitral Award\").\nAs we all know, in 2013, with the instigation and support of the United States, the Philippines initiated the South China Sea arbitration case on the premise of \"legalizing\" the illegal occupation of Nansha islands and reefs. The aim was to consolidate its ill-gotten gains and shrink the space for China's sovereignty and maricreated_at rights. In this case, the arbitral tribunal violated many basic principles that should be followed by international judicial and arbitral institutions, exceeded its jurisdiction, and rendered an award full of loopholes. This farce shows that forcibly bringing the relevant disputes into the track of judicial settlement regardless of the actual conditions does not apply to the complex South China Sea disputes and that the third-party compulsory settlement procedure without the consent of the state deviates from the original intention of the UNCLOS States Parties in designing the dispute settlement mechanism, and undermines the confidence of the States Parties in whether the UNCLOS dispute settlement mechanism can be used correctly in practice.\nSince the 1950s, the Philippines has never given up its coveting of several islands and reefs in the South China Sea but has adopted different methods of infringement and protection at different created_ats. In addition to the illegal occupation, the use of so-called civilian expeditions, the grounding of warships to reefs, the abuse of the dispute settlement mechanism of the law of the sea and the amendment of domestic legislation are all ways for the Philippines to gradually break through the external limits of its territory established by the three international treaties. In recent years, in the process of amending its domestic legislation, the Philippines has deliberately packaged its territorial claims as maricreated_at jurisdiction claims, evaded the legal and political facts of its illegal occupation of Nansha islands and reefs, and ignored the principle of \"land dominating the sea\" in international law.\nAs a provocation against China, the Philippines' push for maricreated_at zone legislation reflects the negative impact and spillover effects of the South China Sea arbitration. The act repeatedly mentions the arbitral award as the \"source and basis\" of the Philippine claim. When the act comes into force, it will further reduce the political space for the Philippines and China to manage the crisis and properly handle controversial issues. In the view of the Philippines, only by continuously adding the content of arbitral awards to domestic legislation can the role of arbitral awards be better played, to continuously consolidate the domestic political, legal, and even social foundation for maricreated_at confrontation with China.\nIn addition to stipulating the nature, status and jurisdiction of the different maricreated_at areas claimed by the Philippines, the act also covers the delimitation of maricreated_at areas, the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, and the settlement of maricreated_at disputes. It can be seen from this that after the law comes into effect, the Philippines may further infringe and provoke China, such as applying for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles in the South China Sea alone or jointly with other parties, advancing negotiations on maricreated_at delimitation in the South China Sea with specific parties, and may also file a new international lawsuit in the South China Sea under the guise of marine environmental protection and freedom of navigation.\nThe Philippine Senate's approval of the act is also part of the Philippines' cognitive warfare provocation against China in the South China Sea. The legislative process of the act echoes the issue of infringement and exaggeration in the Philippines. On the one hand, the Philippines has continued to hype up the events at Ren'ai Reef and HuangYan Island in the arena of public opinion, highlighting the \"urgency\" and \"necessity\" of the legislation to the domestic society and different political forces, to speed up the legislative process. On the other hand, the Philippines has used the legislative achievements to create new topics in the arena of public opinion, and some high-level officials such as the Philippine Coast Guard, the National Security Council, and the Special Committee on Maricreated_at Jurisdictions who like to \"talk tough\" on the South China Sea issue have been constantly making emotional and inflammatory remarks to serve their own political interests while smearing China's image and misleading the international community.\nChina's ability to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests in the South China Sea is no longer what it used to be, and its willingness to maintain stability in the South China Sea remains unwavering. No matter what the Philippines does around the arbitral award, no matter how the Philippines pushes through the domestic legislative process, and no matter what tactics the Philippines uses to try to impose its unilateral claims on China, it will not \"legitimize\" the arbitral award and will not affect China's legitimate claims in the South China Sea under international law. In this regard, China will take strong measures to safeguard territorial sovereignty and regional stability, and at the same created_at, it will also work to bring the Philippines back to the right track of managing maricreated_at disputes through negotiations to avoid escalation of the crisis.\nDing Duo is deputy director and associate research fellow, at the Research Center for Ocean Law and Policy at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies.\nThe opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.\nIf you have a specific expertise, or would like to share your thought about our stories, then send us your writings at opinion@chinadaily.com.cn , and comment@chinadaily.com.cn  \n"

    "text": "\n- Jakarta, Canberra have announced they will sign a new defense agreement in the coming months\n- Pact could include mutual access to training ranges and expedited entry and exit processes for military personnel, says David Andrews of Australia's National Security College\n- Intention for agreement shows 'Canberra is taking note that engagement of ASEAN is crucial,' Jingdong Yuan of Stockholm International Peace Research Institute tells Anadolu\n- Indonesia is 'not interested in taking sides' and wants good regional, international relations, says Beijing-based analyst Einar Tangen\nISTANBUL\nIndonesia and Australia have drawn global attention by declaring their intent to sign a \"very significant\" defense agreement in the coming months.\nExperts believe the deal will be \"crucial\" in Canberra's engagement with the wider Southeast Asia region, particularly amid the festering maricreated_at disputes around the South China Sea.\nNo details have been released about the agreement, which could take a few months to materialize, while Indonesia moves to new era under a new president from October.\nAnalysts believe the pact would be \"especially important in the maricreated_at domain,\" given the adjacent maricreated_at borders, exclusive economic zones, and search and rescue zones of the two nations.\nThe security relationship between the two nations is based on the 2006 Framework for Security Cooperation, also known as the Lombok Treaty, and the 2012 Defense Cooperation Agreement.\nIn 2018, the two countries elevated their relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement.\n\"The new, upgraded Defense Cooperation Agreement will be a welcome addition to these existing arrangements,\" David Andrews, a senior policy adviser at the Australian National University's National Security College, told Anadolu.\n\"But the fundamentals of the agreement are already in place.\"\nWhat to expect in the defense pact\nThe announcement about the defense pact came when Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles met his counterpart Prabowo Subianto in Indonesia last week.\nPrabowo is expected to become Indonesia's president in October as preliminary results of the Feb. 14 elections showed he was leading with over 55% of the vote.\nThe proposed agreement \"aims to upgrade\" the existing Defense Cooperation Agreement, according to Andrews.\nHe said Canberra wants the pact to \"support increased dialogue and improved interoperability between the two militaries.\"\nThat could include \"mutual access to training ranges and expedited entry and exit processes for military personnel conducting exercises in the other country,\" he added.\nThe potential scope of the pact is \"very broad, given the very substantial defense relationship between Australia and Indonesia,\" he said.\nAndrews clarified that the agreement \"will not be an alliance or mutual defense treaty,\" stressing that the focus \"would be purely on streamlining interactions between the two militaries, not establishing security guarantees.\"\nWhile it may strengthen the bilateral relations, \"it is unlikely to be wholly transformational,\" he added.\n\"To be clear … this agreement is not an alliance and we should be careful not to exaggerate the significance of what is a fairly common bilateral undertaking,\" he said.\nEngaging ASEAN\nJingdong Yuan from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) told Anadolu there have been expert views that Australia has not \"paid sufficient attention to this vital relationship\" with Southeast Asia.\nCanberra has \"largely been 'out of the region' in either working closely with the US or being overly preoccupied with developments in the South China Sea, cross-(Taiwan) Strait relations, and US-China rivalry,\" said Yuan, the director of SIPRI's China and Asia Security Program.\nHe pointed out that one \"important aspect of Australia's security should be to work\" with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well its northern Pacific Island neighbors.\nIndonesia is one of 10 members of the ASEAN and shares maricreated_at borders with China, which has disputes with several regional nations over the mineral-rich South China Sea.\nAccording to Yuan, Australia's Labor government has \"only begun to address this (security) concern, but clearly more needs to be done.\"\n\"The very fact that a defense pact is to be signed is a major development of political significance — that Canberra is taking note that engagement of ASEAN is crucial,\" Yuan stressed.\n'Indonesia not taking sides'\nAnalysts based in Beijing believe Indonesia is \"not interested in taking sides\" in the fast-changing geopolitical environment in Asia-Pacific.\nJakarta \"wants good regional and international relations,\" Einar Tangen, a known face in Beijing who comments on Asian affairs, told Anadolu.\nObservers sitting in Beijing do follow such developments keenly since Australia is a long-created_at ally of the US, hosts American troops, is part of the US-led Quad security alliance and will secure nuclear-powered submarines through Washington and the UK under the AUKUS pact.\n\"Jakarta's primary interests are economic development and peaceful regional coexistence,\" said Einar.\nIndonesia remains \"well aware that where Washington goes, conflict follows,\" he said, stressing that \"balancing China and Australia on issues of economy and security are … not mutually exclusive.\"\n\"The reality is that Australia is a neighbor, its close relations with the US are not seen as an impediment to maintaining cordial relations, in terms of economics and security,\" he explained.\n- Dispute in South China Sea\nEinar, who is a senior fellow at the Beijing-based Taihe Institute, said the larger issue is that of maricreated_at borders.\nIt \"is the South China Sea issue between ASEAN members, Taiwan and mainland China,\" he said.\nBeijing claims vast maricreated_at territory in South China Sea under its so-called nine-dash line, which The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration said in 2016 has no legal basis under international law.\nChina says the ruling is not valid and has been in negotiations with ASEAN since 2001 for a code of conduct for the disputed sea.\nIn an apparent move to avoid irking Beijing, Indonesia, which was the ASEAN chair last year, had moved the bloc's first naval exercises away from the disputed sea to its southern Natuna Islands in September.\nHowever, China's relations with the Philippines have recently spiraled over their maricreated_at disputes, and the US has increased its military footprint there, getting access to four more military bases.\nEinar stressed that Beijing \"needs to be creative and created_atly … to counter Washington's efforts to exploit\" the South China Sea issue.\nA consensus solution among all claimants in the South China Sea \"would effectively block US efforts to use this as a divisive issue,\" he said.\n"

No single force can counter them by themselves,\" Marcos said. \"This is why our strategic partnership has grown more important than ever.\"\nMarcos said his father, former President Ferdinand Marcos, and then-Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam reaffirmed that the security of their two countries was bound together in 1974 when they toured the Philippines' WWII battlefields of Bataan and Corregidor.\nAustralia and the Philippines for the first created_at conducted joint sea and air patrols in the South China Sea in November last year.\nMarcos said the Philippines and Australia fought to build a rules-based international order after WWII, and that they must now fight to protect that order in the South China Sea.\n\"The protection of the South China Sea as a vital, critical global artery is crucial to the preservation of regional peace and, I dare say, of global peace,\" Marcos said.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese reminded Marcos of his words when the leaders last met: prosperity and progress dependent on peace.\n\"That is what is so significant about the maricreated_at cooperation activities our two navies completed together for the first created_at in November last year,\" Albanese said.\n\"Our cooperation is an assertion of our national interest and a recognition of our regional responsibility,\" Albanese added.\nMarcos' address was interrupted briefly by Senator Janet Rice, from the minor Greens party, who held up a sign that read: \"Stop human rights abuses,\" in a protest against the Philippines' record on rights.\nRice was later censured by a majority of her colleagues in the Senate with a motion that disapproved of her \"unparliamentary and disrespectful conduct\" in her protest and her \"disregard for the importance of Australia-Philippines relations.\" The censure is symbolic and carries no consequences for Rice.\nMarcos and Albanese yesterday  announced new agreements on maricreated_at cooperation, cybersecurity and fair trade regulation.\nFollowing the two-day state visit, which ends on Thursday, Marcos will return to Australia next week with other Southeast Asian leaders to take part in an ASEAN-Australia Summit that marks 50 years of Australia's partnership with the regional bloc.

    "text": "\nPhilippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. told the Australian parliament on Thursday he would not allow any foreign power to take “one square inch” of the country’s territory, and that Manila was firm in defending its sovereignty.\n“I will not allow any attempt by any foreign power to take even one square inch of our sovereign territory,” he said in a speech.\nAustralia and the Philippines started their first joint sea and air patrols in the South China Sea in November, aimed at countering an increasingly assertive China, which claims the entire sea as its own.\nThe South China Sea is a conduit for more than $3 trillion (P168.5 trillion) worth of ship-borne commerce each year and is a major source of tension between the Philippines and China.\nThe Philippines accuses China of committing aggressive acts inside its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). A United Nations-backed arbitration court based in the Hague in 2016 ruled that China’s claims inside the Philippines’ EEZ had no legal basis — a decision Beijing has rejected.\nChina has chided the Philippines for encroaching on what it says is its territory.\nProtecting the area is important to global stability, Mr. Marcos said.\n“The protection of the South China Sea as a vital, critical global artery is crucial to the preservation of regional peace and, I dare say, of global peace,” he said. “We have an abiding interest in keeping our seas free and open, and in ensuring unimpeded passage and freedom of navigation.”\nMr. Marcos said the Philippines is now on the frontline of a battle to keep stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\nHe issued the remarks as the Philippines and Australia signed deals to boost their ties in the maricreated_at domain and critical technology.\n“As in 1942, the Philippines now finds itself on the frontline against actions that undermine regional peace, erode regional stability and threaten regional success,” according to a copy of his speech provided by the presidential palace.\n“Then as now, the security and continued prosperity of the region — of countries like Australia — relies upon that effort,” he added.\nOne of the deals signed by the two countries seek to enhance information-sharing and interoperability between their maricreated_at agencies, Mr. Marcos said in a press briefing with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Norman Albanese.\nThe second deal seeks to promote the open and secure use of cyberspace between the two countries, while the third calls for cooperation between their national competition commissions.\nUnder the deal, the two countries would share practices and pursue capacity-building “on matters involving merger regulations, competition laws and investigative techniques relevant to implementing competition laws,” the palace said in a statement.\nRaymond M. Powell, a fellow at Stanford University’s Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, said Philippine efforts to expose Chinese bullying in the South China Sea has been “yielding tangible gains.”\n“President Marcos’ approach to the West Philippine Sea requires strong international support,” he said in an X message. “He has been pushing for expanded joint patrols involving not just the US but also other regional military powers like Japan and Australia.”\nJeffrey Ordaniel, director for maricreated_at security at Pacific Forum and an associate professor of international security studies at the Tokyo International University, said deepening Philippine-Australia ties could lead to a four-way security deal involving the US and Japan.\n“Closer Australia-Japan, Philippine-Japan and Philippine-Australia relations are prerequisites to forming a more formal quadrilateral coordination on common security concerns, in particular challenges in the South China Sea and over China’s potential invasion of Taiwan,” he told BusinessWorld in an X message.\n“Japan and Australia are already important security assistance providers of the Philippines, complementing US efforts in enabling Manila to play bigger security roles,” he added.\nAustralia should push its defense companies to help the Philippines find its niche in the global arms trade, Joshua Bernard B. Espeña, vice president at Manila-based International Development and Security Cooperation, said in a Facebook Messenger chat.\nDon Mclain Gill, who teaches international relations at De La Salle University, said Philippine-Australian partnership has grown tenfold given their shared goal of keeping the Indo-Pacific free.\nMr. Marcos was in Australia on an official visit, before he attends a special summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Melbourne next week.\n"

    "text": "\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos jnr of the Philippines has gone to Australia's parliament to invoke the common spirit of 1942 and resistance to Japan and vowing that his country \"will not yield\" in allowing any foreign power \"to take even one square inch of our sovereign territory\" or to upset the region's peace, stability and success. They are the most strikingly forthright comments made by any South-East Asian leader in Australia in decades, after the Albanese government offered Mr Marcos its highest-profile venue to do so. Mr Marcos did not mention China by name. But the Philippines' clashes with swarming Chinese coast guard and fishing vessels last year as it struggled to resupply its lone outpost on the Second Thomas Shoal, just 200 kilometres from its shores, have been among the most intense in the whole crisis over claims in the South China Sea.\nAustralia has been noticeably upfront in supporting the Philippines, with Defence Minister Richard Marles promising joint maricreated_at patrols last year and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visiting Manila even as he confirmed a historic fence-mending trip to Beijing. China has clearly singled out the Philippines for special attention. A 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling on a case brought by Manila has become the chief legal basis for international pushback against China's claims in the South China Sea.\nManila's historic ties with Washington have rebounded after Mr Marcos' predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, tilted to Beijing for a few years. Mr Marcos has allowed the US four new bases in the country, overlooking the Luzon Channel between the Philippines and Taiwan and an important exit from the South China Sea. Beijing appears bent on both punishing Manila and demonstrating that Washington can't help it much, which makes Australia's support even more significant. It's not unreasonable to question whether America has the capacity or inclination to remain a dominant power in Asia as it was in, say, the 1980s. But what has changed significantly in just the past few years is that Australia has become part of a tightening network of Asian nations including Japan, South Korea, and India who are keen to keep the US engaged and are suspicious of Beijing's intentions.\nMr Marcos also gave his speech on the eve of the fourth ASEAN-Australia Summit, when most of South-East Asia's heads of government will be in Melbourne. ASEAN is the text those nations rely on to provide a first diplomatic counterweight to China. ASEAN has lasted as long as it has done since 1967 by not pressing positions too hard and by seeking the lowest common denominator of agreement. But \"ASEAN centrality\" is still the key phrase in regional diplomatic jargon. Experts say that its real meaning is in giving big powers like China and the US a means of talking to the region, yet without being big enough to actually stymie them. ASEAN lives in fear of grey zone confrontations at sea turning into real conflicts that would engulf them all. It sees a Swiss-style neutrality as its best defence against overbearing big powers like China. That means as few weapons in the region as possible, and essentially relying on China's own economic self-interest in South-East Asia to hold it back. But ASEAN accepts that front-line members like the Philippines and Vietnam are going to push back by themselves when they have to.\nASEAN is also the key to Foreign Minister Penny Wong's hope for greater \"regional equilibrium\" in which all states large and small can co-exist in a system of rules. That is the ideal solution by far to the tensions in the region. But Australia is also right to offer solidarity to the Philippines. A binding code of conduct covering the South China Sea between Beijing and ASEAN has been discussed since the 1990s, but is stuck at the stage of talks about talks to actually bring it into existence. Until then, Australia is right to support nations whose waters come under pressure.\nAnd regional dynamics might be changing. ASEAN often takes its cues from its biggest member, Indonesia, whose president-elect Prabowo Subianto would likely follow President Marcos in telling China to keep off, and rightly seeking international support to do so.\n"

Manila has drummed up international support over the past year by publicizing Chinese encroachment within its international exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\n\"We are called upon once again to join forces, together with our partners, in the face of threats to the rule of law, to stability, and to peace,\" Marcos said, in a thinly veiled reference to Beijing.\nThe Chinese embassy in the Philippines did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.\nRemarking on examples of Philippines-Australia cooperation, he pointed out that aside from Mutual Defense Treaty ally the U.S., Australia the only country with which the Philippines shares a visiting forces agreement.\nHe also cited joint security exercises the Philippines held with the Australian and the U.S. militaries last year as examples of engagement that supports \"free and open\" navigation in the well-trafficked waterway.\nAustralia has had its own run-ins with China's military. In 2022 Canberra complained a People's Liberation Army Air Force jet had unsafely jettisoned chaff that was sucked into the engine of an Australian patrol plane in international airspace.\nIn November, a Chinese destroyer allegedly injured Australian divers in the East China Sea near Japan.\nThe South China Sea is critical to regional and global peace, he said. \"Prosperity and development [in the region] are anchored in the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific,\" which is now under threat, Marcos warned.\nThe Philippine president also said it is imperative to uphold and defend the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which he dubbed the \"constitution of the ocean.\"\nThe 1982 convention formed the basis of an international arbitral court's 2016 ruling that largely dismissed China's sweeping claims over featurse within the Philippines' 200-nautical-mile EEZ.\nChina spurned the proceedings and to this day maintains the decision was illegal, citing unspecified Chinese historical rights to those waters.\nLast month, the Philippine government approved $35 billion in spending over the next decade to upgrade its military.

    "text": "\nChina and Malaysia mark 50 years of ties with stronger cooperation set to come\nThe celebration of the 50th anniversary is often associated with gold, and the Chinese saying \"pure gold does not fear the test of fire\" describes the relationship between China and Malaysia. This is because, over the past five decades, the relationship between the two countries has experienced various challenges but remains friendly and firm, like pure gold, and it still retains its quality despite the heat of the fire.\nMalaysia was the first country among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to establish diplomatic relations with China during the official visit to Beijing in 1974 of then Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak. Bilateral diplomatic relations between Malaysia and China began following the Joint Communique between Malaysia and China in Beijing on May 31, 1974. Since then, Malaysia has adhered to the one-China policy.\nAlthough bilateral relations were established in 1974, at the initial stage, there were still some challenges due to the Cold War. Relations were strengthened when the travel ban to China was lifted in 1985. However, bilateral relations really started to improve after 1991, when the Cold War ended. One of the main components of China-Malaysia relations is their economic ties. Trade between Malaysia and China has grown from $388 million in 1985 to $203.6 billion in 2022, up over 500 created_ats in 37 years.\nIt is noteworthy that China has been Malaysia's largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years, and Malaysia is China's second-largest trading partner among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Fifty years ago, China-Malaysia trade involved agricultural products. However, nowadays, it involves sophisticated enterprises and industries such as the East Coast Rail Line, the Kuantan Malaysia-China Industrial Park, and cooperation in the digital economy, green development, and new energy. For example, Geely plans to invest $10 billion in Malaysia for the development of the Automotive High-Technology Valley. Vehicle companies such as BYD, Chery and Great Wall Motor are also actively expanding into the Malaysian market. Telecommunications companies such as Huawei, ZTE, and others are collaborating with local companies to provide better communication network services and make Malaysia a digital economic hub in Southeast Asia.\nIn terms of people-to-people relations, cooperation between China and Malaysia also includes education. Among them, Tsinghua University has agreed to strengthen cooperation with universities in Malaysia on the exchange of students, academics, and researchers and embrace the opportunity to conduct joint research. In addition, Xiamen University already has its campus in Sepang, Selangor. It is interesting to note that Malaysian public and private universities have been the primary target for many Chinese students to further their studies.\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit Malaysia, China returned Malaysia's favor by sending equipment such as face masks, ventilators, test kits, and sanitizers to help the Malaysian government contain the spread of the virus.\nChina-Malaysia relations also face various challenges and obstacles. Among them is the issue of overlapping claims in the South China Sea and tensions between the United States and China. On the issue of overlapping claims in the South China Sea, Malaysia is consistent with its stance that the way to a solution is through negotiation and peace based on international law and international norms. It is estimated that almost 40 to 50 percent of goods traded in the world pass through the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, so any military conflict in the waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca will bring losses to all parties.\nNeutrality has become the core of Malaysia's foreign policy. Malaysia wants to avoid being dragged into the political arrangement of the big powers. Since its independence in 1957, Malaysia has established friendly relations with all countries. The United States under the Joe Biden administration has become more active in Southeast Asia. However, the US should refrain from continuing the policy of confrontation with China and expecting countries to choose either the US or China. Malaysia hopes the US will show leadership for common interests and prioritize multilateralism.\nThis year in the Chinese zodiac is the Year of the Dragon, a mystical animal often associated with China, while the tiger is a symbol of Malaysia. This year, we will witness close cooperation between the \"dragon and tiger\".\nAlthough diplomatic relations between Malaysia and China only started in 1974, in terms of history, Malaysia-China relations have been intertwined for hundreds of years. It should be emphasized that the history of Malaysia-China relations is one of friendship and mutual respect. Malaysia-China relations are win-win because both countries need each other. As the Chinese say, \"Gold is easy to get, but best friends are harder to find\".\nThe author is an associate professor and deputy executive director of the Asia-Europe Institute at the University of Malaya and a member of the Belt and Road Initiative Caucus for the Asia Pacific.

We already have [an] existing cooperation [agreement] with Germany ... so I think that will just strengthen with the President's visit,\" she told The Manila created_ats.\nThe scheduled visit of the President to Germany comes amid heightened tensions between the Philippines and China, both of whom claim territory in the South China Sea and have traded accusations of aggressive behavior in the strategic waterway.\nOn Wednesday, the President described as \"worrisome\" the recent developments in the West Philippine Sea, including the presence of the Chinese navy and interference with electronic communication capabilities of Philippine vessels.\nBanzon-Abalos said the President's upcoming visit would be an opportune created_at to discuss pressing issues of common concern affecting both countries.\n\"There's a lot of potential in terms of the partnership so we're hoping that the visit of the President will provide that political impetus to start the actual cooperation agreements,\" she said.\nDuring her visit to Manila in January, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said her government is ready to work with the Philippines to prevent a crisis from breaking out in the West Philippine Sea by helping it promote international law while strengthening its maricreated_at security.\nBaerbock called out China's \"claims for extensive maricreated_at areas\" and harassment against Filipino vessels in the West Philippine Sea.\n\"There are truly rough winds blowing across the South China Sea, and this is happening in the middle of one of the most economic regions of the world,\" Baerbock said in an earlier media interview.\n\"The incidents over the recent months where the Chinese coast guard has used lasers and water cannons against Philippine resupply vessels - and even collisions happened - are of concern also for us in Europe, even though we're thousands of kilometers away, because such risky maneuvers violate the rights and opportunities for economic development of your own country and other littoral states as well,\" she added.\nChina claims nearly the entire South China Sea, pointing to a line on its maps that cuts into the exclusive economic zones of Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia.\nIn 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague said China's claims had no legal basis. China has rejected that ruling.\nMeanwhile, Banzon-Abalos said Germany has expressed interest in hiring not only Filipino nurses, but also other skilled workers like engineers and those in the hospitality industry.\n\"The German laws have recently been relaxed because they have a labor shortage. So we expect a lot of Filipinos to be coming to Germany to fill in those labor shortages,\" she said.\nGermany is home to 36,135 Filipinos as of December 2022, the Department of Foreign Affairs said.\nTotal trade with Germany reached $3.91 billion with exports valued at $2.28 billion and imports at $1.63 billion. In 2022, Germany ranked as the Philippines 12th biggest trading partner, 10th biggest export market and 15th biggest supplier.\nPhilippine-Germany diplomatic relations span 69 years since they were established on Oct. 8, 1954. The two countries are set to celebrate 70 years of diplomatic relations this year.\n"

    "text": "\nStarting from March 2, Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Eurasian Affairs Li Hui will visit Russia, the EU headquarters, Poland, Ukraine, Germany and France for the second round of shuttle diplomacy on seeking a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.\nCCTV: Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) started to dump the fourth batch of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean on February 28. The discharge is expected to last until March 17 and reach nearly 7,800 tonnes. What's China's comment?\nMao Ning: Despite international concern and opposition, Japan has dumped over 23,000 tonnes of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, spreading the risk of contamination worldwide. This is against the international law and a seriously irresponsible move. China firmly opposes it and asks Japan to stop this wrongdoing.\nRecent incidents at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station where nuclear-contaminated water was splashed onto workers and leaked from the purification system spotlight TEPCO's management deficiency and inadequate government oversight. Japan's claim that the discharge is safe and reliable is not convincing.\nThe ocean discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water impacts the health of all humanity, the global marine environment and the international public interest. Japan needs to take seriously domestic and international concerns and handle the discharge properly with a responsible and constructive attitude. China urges Japan to provide full cooperation in setting up an independent international monitoring arrangement that remains effective in the long haul and has the substantive participation of Japan's neighboring countries and other stakeholders, so as to avoid irrevocable consequences stemming from the ocean discharge.\nGlobal created_ats: You just announced that Special Representative Li Hui will carry out the second round of shuttle diplomacy on seeking a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Could you explain the timing for the action? What's China's expectation for Li Hui's trip?\nMao Ning: It has been two years since the full escalation of the Ukraine crisis began. As the conflict drags on, the most urgent priority now is to restore peace. The sooner peace talks begin, the less the damage that is done.\nIn the past two years, China has never given up on promoting peace or slackened its efforts to facilitate talks. We had in-depth exchanges with countries including Russia and Ukraine, playing a constructive role in addressing the crisis. China also published its position paper on the political settlement of the crisis, and its special envoy traveled intensively to mediate among different parties. China has not sat idly by or added fuel to the flame, still less profiteered from the conflict. Behind all this, there is only one goal that China hopes to achieve, that is, to build consensus for ending the conflict and pave the way for peace talks. China will continue to play its role, carry out shuttle diplomacy, pool consensus and contribute China's wisdom for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.\nAFP: The world reacted to French President Emmanuel Macron's statement this week that the possibility of sending Western troops to Ukraine is not ruled out. The White House spokesperson said yesterday that the US will not send troops to Ukraine. What's the Foreign Ministry's comment on Macron's statement?\nMao Ning: China's position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We call on all sides to build consensus and accumulate conditions for deescalation and ceasefire. China will continue to play a constructive role for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.\nAFP: It's reported that the Filipino President said today that the presence of China's Navy and China Coast Guard vessels at Huangyan Dao is worrisome. What's your comment?\nMao Ning: China's position on the South China Sea is consistent and clear. We express grave concern over the Philippines' recent activities in the South China Sea that infringe on China's sovereignty and will continue to take necessary measures to firmly safeguard our territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests, and keep the South China Sea peaceful and stable.\nSource: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China\n"

    "text": "\n PRESIDENT Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. on Thursday called for international cooperation to ensure continued free access to the South China Sea (SCS), which he said is crucial in maintaining global peace.\n'The protection of the South China Sea as a vital, critical global artery is crucial to the preservation of regional peace and, I daresay, of global peace,' Marcos said during his address before the Australian Parliament.\n'We are called upon once again to join forces, together with our partners, in the face of threats to the rule of law, to stability, and to peace,' he added.\nThe President made the pronouncements amid new reports of a Chinese warship being sighted in the West Philippine Sea (WPS), parts of the SCS within the country's territory. China has cited 'historic right' to lay claim to the entire SCS.\nIn previous months, Chinese Coast Guard ships also fired water cannons on Philippine Coast Guard ships on a Rotation and Resupply (RORE) mission in the Ayungin Shoal located in the WPS.\nDespite the incidents, Marcos said his administration will not yield to any attempts by other countries to take over Philippine territory.\n'The challenges that we face may be formidable, but equally formidable is our resolve,' Marcos said.\nInternational deterrence\nHe thanked the Australian government for extending support to the Philippines in maintaining 'unimpeded passage and freedom of navigation' in the SCS.\n'And so, on behalf of the Filipino people, I thank you, Australia, for standing with the Republic of the Philippines,' Marcos said.\nThe country has several security and defense agreements with Australia, including a Visiting Forces Agreement.\nPeter Dutton, the leader of the opposition in the Australian Parliament, agreed with Marcos on the need for an 'international deterrence' against 'emboldened autocrats and belligerent regimes who show utter contempt for sovereignty, law and liberty.'\n'Together with our many partners and friends in the region, we must all continue to speak up with courage in calling out acts of intimidation and interference. We must all maintain our strenuous efforts in diplomacy and we must all especially lift our individual efforts to support our collective goal of integrated deterrence,' Dutton said.\nHe said he hopes the said 'defense deterrence' will be further discussed during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean)-Australia Special Summit.\nMarcos concluded his two-day state visit in Canberra, Australia on Thursday.\nHe will be flying to Melbourne, Australia on March 4 to 6 to participate in the Asean-Australia Summit.\n"

    "text": "\nThe services of the U.S. armed forces have led or joined at least 20 multinational training events in the Western Pacific since January, many with the aim of maintaining readiness to face adversaries including North Korea and strategic rivals like China.\nIn the Indian and Pacific oceans—a combined theater of operations the Pentagon says will remain a priority for decades to come—American troops have been deployed for nearly 10 weeks in various bilateral, trilateral and multilateral exercises. This is according to public releases by the Hawaii-based U.S. Indo-Pacific Command or its regional constituents.\nLast month, on the second anniversary of the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific strategy, the National Security Council said \"historic progress\" had been made to ensure the region remained favorable to the United States and American staying power in an age of great power competition.\nAdvisers of President Joe Biden, who campaigned on a promise to reinvigorate existing alliances in the region, have touted successes including a growing trilateral defense partnership between the U.S., South Korea and Japan. This was once thought unlikely because of decades-long warcreated_at grievances.\nThe breakthrough at Camp David last August sent a clear message to China, as did the Philippine decision earlier in the year to grant visiting U.S. forces greater access to bases in strategic locations.\nLeaders in Beijing have accused their American counterparts of waging a new Cold War amid a multifaceted rivalry that spans trade, technology, military and global governance. They have also accused Washington of \"building small exclusive blocs to grossly interfere in China's internal affairs, slander China and instigate confrontation.\"\nA Newsweek graphic that tracks 21 publicly announced events in 2024 shows the U.S. military maintaining a constant presence in the Western Pacific, including in the seas and airspace on China's periphery.\nIn at least nine exercises in January, the U.S. Navy held multilateral anti-submarine war games in Guam; sailed with the Philippine navy in the South China Sea; led trilateral drills with South Korea and Japan in the East China Sea; and conducted a dual aircraft-carrier exercise in the Philippine Sea with Japan's Maricreated_at Self-Defense Force.\nThe same month, the U.S. Army trained with South Korean and Japanese ground forces, and the U.S. Air Force flew two B-1B bombers to Singapore for bilateral training.\nIn late January, a Navy destroyer sailed through the Taiwan Strait, drawing condemnation from the Chinese military, and the U.S. Coast Guard held capacity-building training in the Marshall Islands with partners from the Pacific Islands.\n\"Practicing power projection throughout the Indo-Pacific during peacecreated_at is critical for ensuring readiness and deterrence in created_ats of contingency,\" Craig Singleton, a senior fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank, told Newsweek.\n\"These exercises enhance interoperability among regional allies and partners, bolstering our collective ability to respond swiftly and effectively to emerging security challenges,\" Singleton said.\n\"Additionally, they send a clear signal of resolve to potential adversaries—namely China—deterring aggression and promoting stability in the region,\" he added.\nAmong a dozen publicly announced events in February was the largest annual multilateral air drills hosted by Anderson Air Force Base in Guam, where 2,400 troops gathered, according to the U.S. Pacific Air Forces.\nThe Navy returned to the South China Sea with warships from Japan and Australia earlier in the month, and then jointly patrolled Beijing-claimed maricreated_at zones with U.S. treaty ally Manila. A nuclear-capable Air Force B-52H bomber was later escorted by Philippine fighter jets over the same waters.\nAt its monthly press conference on Thursday, China's Defense Ministry accused the Philippines of roping in an extra-regional power to \"stir up the South China Sea,\" over which Beijing continues to claim sovereignty.\nAaron-Matthew Lariosa, Washington-based independent Indo-Pacific security analyst, told Newsweek that the U.S.-Philippine bomber patrol was notable, even if its \"operational value\" was unclear.\n\"Coming after increased tensions between Beijing and Manila in the South China Sea, these joint patrols aim to demonstrate solidarity and resolve from Washington to its oldest ally in the Indo-Pacific,\" said Lariosa.\n\"The presence of U.S. aircraft and vessels shows tangible American presence to Philippine forces, who are outmatched quantitatively and qualitatively by their Chinese counterparts,\" he added.\nAlso last month, the U.S. Marine Corps trained with counterparts in the South Korea, and the Navy held special forces exercises on Japan's Okinawa island, which hosts the most forward-deployed American troops anywhere in the world outside of U.S. territory.\nIn the South Pacific, the Coast Guard spent a week helping the island country Kiribati patrol its vast exclusive economic zone, boarding two Chinese fishing vessels for routine inspections in the process.\nThe U.S. Pacific Fleet said, in late February, the Navy was in the Bay of Bengal to join an India-led multinational exercise, which included attendees from Russia and Iran, but not China.\nU.S. forces are in Nepal for peacekeeping training and are jointly hosting a multinational exercise in Thailand, to which the Chinese People's Liberation Army sent 25 personnel. Both events continue until early March.\nMajor bilateral training exercises by U.S. forces in Japan and South Korea—including simulated war games—were not counted.\nBeijing has in recent years pushed back on the U.S.'s extensive military presence off its shores. Air Force flights and Navy operations in nearby seas have been met by dangerous intercepts, the U.S. Defense Department said last year.\nU.S.-China relations, which have nosedived in recent years, have stabilized since Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's November meeting in San Francisco, during which both sides agreed to reestablish military-to-military dialogue.\nIn late January, its spokesperson, Wu Qian, said tensions were the result of U.S. military \"provocations at China's doorstep,\" including \"long-term, large-scale and frequent close-in reconnaissance in the waters and airspace around China.\"\nThe Pentagon says the U.S. military \"flies, sails and operates anywhere international law allows.\"\nIn an episode of the War on the Rocks podcast released last month, Ely Ratner, assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said the U.S. would need to innovate its strategies to keep peace in the Pacific amid China's military buildup.\n\"We are also developing new operational concepts that make it much more difficult for China to succeed with the type of capability and strategy it has been building, certainly to the extent that it's been building its forces against an old American way of war,\" Ratner said.\n\"And we're working with allies and partners in the region as well to present a broader set of challenges for China, so it has to consider, if it starts a war against the United States, might that metastasize into a broader regional war against other allies and partners,\" Ratner added.\nThe Chinese Defense Ministry did not answer multiple calls and emails seeking comment.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nU.S. Forces Train In Pacific Region\nMass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Isaiah B.

    "text": "\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr has warned that peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific is under threat, but stopped just short of naming China as the top threat to peace in the region.\nIn an address to both houses of parliament - and in an unusually direct speech for the leader of a major Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) player - Marcos said the region's security and prosperity depended on countries working together to counter \"the common challenges confronting the region. No one single country can do this by itself.\"\nThe president said Australia's destiny was irrevocably linked to that of Asia and that \"over the years you have held true to this tenet. You have become a valuable member of Asia and of the Indo-Pacific.\"\nThe comment echoes that of former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who in the 1990s described Australia as a US outpost, but who by 2019 argued Australia's future lay in Asia.\nAhead of the ASEAN-Australia summit in Melbourne next week, Marcos also highlighted the threat climate change posed to both his own country and the entire region, and said that developed countries such as Australia must do more to combat the warming of the planet.\nMarcos was elected president in 2022 and is widely known by his nickname \"Bongbong\". He is the son of former Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr, who ruled the country from 1965 to 1986 and whose wife, Imelda, was famous for owning several thousand pairs of shoes.\nMarcos Jr told parliament: \"I will not allow any attempt by any foreign power to take even one square inch of our sovereign territory.\"\n\"For the Philippines, Australia plays a crucial role as one of only two partners with which the Philippines has a visiting forces agreement,\" he said, highlighting a Filipino-US-Australian joint exercise that involved 560 Filipino soldiers, 1200 Australian service personnel and 120 US marines.\n\"The protection of the South China Sea, a critical global artery, is crucial to the preservation of regional peace and ... global peace. We have an abiding interest in keeping our seas free and open and in ensuring unimpeded passage and freedom of navigation.\"\nIn 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled China had no claim to large swaths of the South China Sea, but Beijing ignored the ruling and built a series of military bases, including on outcrops such as the Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, close to the Philippines' main islands.\nThe two navies and coastguards clash often over disputed territory.\nUnlike his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who was friendlier to China and whose war on drugs led to credible accusations that thousands of people were murdered in extra-judicial killings, Marcos has repositioned the Philippines within the United States' sphere of influence in South-East Asia.\nAlbanese praised the Philippines as one of Australia's key partners in the region and said \"we share a vision for an open, stable and prosperous region\".\n\"Our strategic partnership will bring great benefits to Australians and Filipinos,\" he said.\n"

    "text": "\nMar. 1—JAKARTA ( The Jakarta Post/ANN) — Russia's two-year invasion of Ukraine has once again proven the truth of the old proverb \"Menang jadi arang, kalah jadi abu\" (win to charcoal, lose to dust). Both the aggressor and the defender have suffered greatly from the consequences of the war, although the former should take the blame for starting the fire. In the end, there will be no real winner in the war.\nThe invasion should also serve as a warning for nations, including ASEAN member states, to never depend on others, regardless of their might or proximity, when it comes to territorial integrity. Conversely, bigger powers cannot bully smaller neighbors without any consequences.\nAmid the intensified rivalry between the United States and China for the sphere of influence, especially in the South China Sea, the 10-member ASEAN should not allow itself to fall into the trap of the hegemonic competition between the two superpowers. It will not be easy for the ASEAN states, especially if they are lured by economic incentives or military protection.\nMany ASEAN member states still rely on the US for security and defense against China's growing dominance in the region. China and four of its ASEAN neighbors have been embroiled in decades-long overlapping claims in the resource-rich South China Sea, but this does not wipe out the fact that ASEAN as a whole is economically dependent on China, which is why ties between the two have remained sustainable.\nIn the case of Russia, its overconfidence has cost it more than it had anticipated. President Vladimir Putin, however, has little choice but to continue the war until he thinks his mission is accomplished. On the other side, Ukraine, too, seemed certain the West would fully support its fight against Russia. However, it later learned the gap between hope and reality can be gaping.\nAfter two years of war, both Russia and Ukraine have conceded losses not only in the form of the lives of thousands of troops and civilians, but also the devastation of their economies. For its part, Russia is under economic sanctions from the West and isolation from the outside world. Domestically, Putin is also facing rising opposition, although this cannot match his absolute power.\nFollowing Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the United Nations General Assembly, including all ASEAN members, overwhelmingly condemned the military aggression. Only five countries, Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria, voted against the condemnation while 141 voted in favor.\nIn the beginning of the war, the European Union, NATO and the US vowed to not let Putin go unpunished and to provide all necessary assistance to Ukraine, especially arms. They said they would never give up until Putin withdrew his troops from Ukraine unconditionally.\nUS President Joe Biden vowed to provide full support to help President Volodymyr Zelensky in liberating his country from Russia's invasion. But the Republican-dominated Congress blocked much of Biden's military supply to Kyiv. It would be a nightmare for Ukraine if Donald Trump won this November election. Trump is an admirer of Putin and has repeatedly said that all NATO members should pay more for their security protection.\nAs described by The Guardian in its Feb. 21, 2024 edition, when the invasion of Ukraine began two years ago, some predicted it could take as little as three days for Russian forces to capture the capital, Kyiv. But they were wrong, and Putin now seems to be waiting for Western support for Ukraine to wither.\n\"Though support for Ukraine among Europeans remains broad, barely 10 percent believe it can defeat Russia, according to an EU-wide survey, with some form of \"compromise settlement\" seen as the most likely endpoint,\" The Guardian wrote.\nWhat is happening now to Ukraine can befall any nation. The invasion of Ukraine has taught us a dear lesson about the invaluable price of sovereign freedom. Even allies cannot protect us, we only have ourselves.\nWith losses mounting on both sides, peace should be the most logical endgame Russia and Ukraine strive for.\n___ (c)2024 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

    "text": "\nA thorough investigation of \"America's top foreign policy challenge.\"  One of the most significant geopolitical trends is the explosive growth of China. With assistance from Graff, Alperovitch, entrepreneur, cybersecurity expert, and founding member of the U.S. government's Cyber Safety Review Board, warns that America is now engaged in \"Cold War II\" with a nation far more populous and efficient than the former Soviet Union -and just as skilled at bending the rules. \nThe author begins with a fictional scenario describing China's conquest of Taiwan in 2028. Most readers know that this is a long-standing Chinese obsession, but Alperovitch emphasizes that it would be a massive geopolitical triumph, assuring domination of the South China Sea and access to one of the world's most valuable resources: computer chips. \"Taiwan alone is responsible for nearly 40 percent of new computing power manufactured every year worldwide,\" writes the author, adding that the Chinese are as productive, hardworking, and imaginative as Americans-and there are four created_ats as many of them. Beijing's goal of becoming the world's top superpower seems inevitable unless U.S. officials act decisively. \"To succeed over the next half century,\" writes Alperovitch, the U.S. \"needs to prioritize two broad enablers of innovation-semiconductor chips and immigration.\" Regarding the latter, the author echoes other observers in his demonstration of how the U.S. discourages even skilled legal immigrants, a significant problem. Giving computer chips so much emphasis seems a stretch, but the author makes a convincing case that they are today's primary engines of progress. Eschewing the usual homilies about freedom, the author urges America to pay more attention to traditional allies as well as China's neighbors. \"Other countries do not need to love us...and most of them...never will,\" he writes. \"But as long as they hate China more, they may prefer to partner with us.\"  Deeply insightful advice for the coming decades.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-30\nPublisher: PublicAffairs\nStage: NonFiction\nISBN: 9781541704091\nPrice: $32.50\nAuthor: Alperovitch, Dmitri\n"

Once again, we must come together as partners to face the common challenges confronting the region.\"\nMr Marcos is the first leader from the Association of South East Asian Nations to arrive in Australia for next week's special leaders' summit in Melbourne marking 50 years of ties between Australia and ASEAN.\nASEAN has emerged as a key regional bloc in the geopolitical contest between China and the West. While most members are trying to hedge between the two, some, such as the Philippines, are closer to the US while others, like Cambodia, are moving closer to China.\nThe consensus-based approach to ASEAN decision-making also means the text has become a byword for gridlock.\nNext week's summit is aimed at shoring up Australia's close ties to the region amid the rising strategic tensions, while emphasising business opportunities in the fast-growing economies, as well as the shared challenge of mitigating climate change.\n\"Australia's economic future lies with South-East Asia, and we're determined to drive growth in trade and investment in line with our South-East Asia Economic Strategy to 2040,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said yesterday.\n\"The Philippines is one of the fastest-growing economies in our region and there's great potential to deepen our two-way trade and investment links.\"\nThe two leaders signed three memoranda of understanding. The maricreated_at co-operation agreement covers civil maricreated_at security, marine environment protection, maricreated_at domain awareness and promoting respect for international law.\nAn agreement on cyber and critical technology is aimed at protecting against cyberattacks and fostering co-operation on the digital economy, while the countries' competition commissions will work together to enhance competition law and policy.\nWhile Mr Marcos did not name China in his speech, he used incredibly frank language for a South-East Asian leader not heard before in Australia's parliament. The intent was clear, given the growing friction between Beijing and Manila over competing territorial maricreated_at claims.\nA 2016 ruling by an international tribunal under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea found heavily in the Philippines' favour, dismissing China's \"nine-dash line\" maricreated_at claims. But Beijing has repudiated the ruling.\nMr Marcos said Australia's backing for the ruling was welcome, as he warned instability in the South China Sea was a threat to world peace, and it was vital that global trade arteries remained open.\nHe said the strategic partnership between Australia and the Philippines had grown more important than ever, noting Australia and the US were the only two countries Manila had a visiting military forces agreement with.\nHe highlighted how last year Australia and the Philippines conducted their first joint patrol of the South China Sea, while 1200 Australian troops also participated in joint war games with Filipino and US troops.\n\"We are called upon once again to join forces, together with our partners, in the face of threats to the rule of law, to stability and to peace,\" Mr Marcos said.\n\"We must reinforce each other's strengths, we must protect the peace that we fought for during [World War II] and have jealously guarded in the decades since.\n\"We must oppose actions that clearly denigrate the rule of law.\n\"As in 1942, the Philippines now finds itself on the front line against actions that undermine regional peace, erode regional stability and threaten regional success. Then, as now, we remain firm in defending our sovereignty, our sovereign rights and jurisdiction.\n\"I shall never tire of repeating the declaration that I made from the first day that I took office: 'I will not allow any attempt by any foreign power to take even one square inch of our sovereign territory. The challenges that we face may be formidable, but equally formidable is our resolve. We will not yield.'\n\"Then, as now, the security and continued prosperity of a region of countries like Australia relies upon that effort.\"\nMr Albanese said that as both island and trading nations, the Law of the Sea was \"not an abstract notion or a theoretical question\" for Australia and the Philippines, as he also highlighted the importance of the joint naval patrols.\n\"Freedom of navigation is fundamental to our sovereignty, our prosperity, our security and our territorial integrity,\" he said.\n\"Our co-operation is an assertion of our national interest and a recognition of our regional responsibility.\n\"It reflects our shared understanding that peace depends on more than the presence of the great powers. All of us in the international community, middle powers like our countries, as well as small nations, have our part to play in building a more stable, peaceful and prosperous future.\"\n"

    "text": "\nTHE Department of Energy (DoE) said on Wednesday that proposals in the House of Representatives to remove foreign-ownership restrictions from the 1987 Constitution, particularly in the power generation industry, will result in reduced electricity rates.\n“(Power) generation is subject to the movement of the cost of fuel, (which we do not have control over, so if we do open up, generation would be the best place (to allow investors in,)” Energy Undersecretary Sharon S. Garin told the House Committee of the Whole late Wednesday.\nThe DoE supports amending Section 11 of Article 12 of the 1987 Constitution to allow foreign equity investment in the public utilities sector.\nLegislators this week began deliberations on Resolution of Both Houses No. 7, which seeks to ease foreign ownership restrictions in public utilities, education and advertising.\n“If you increase competition there, I think that will have a bigger impact on the cost to consumers,” she added.\nMs. Garin cited an increase in investment in the renewable energy (RE) industry after the DoE in 2022 allowed 100% foreign ownership of RE projects by amending the implementing rules and regulations of the Renewable Energy Act of 2008.\n“Since the approval of the new IRR up to December 2023, we have had 400 applications for RE service contracts. We have awarded, for 2023 alone, 275 service contracts, with a potential capacity of 39,622 megawatts (MW), for a total of estimated cost of investment of P8.53 trillion,” she told the committee.\nParty-list Rep. Sergio C. Dagooc said he supports allowing foreign investors into generation, but maintained that Filipinos must keep majority control over the distribution and transmission of power.\nManila Electric Co. (Meralco) regulatory affairs head Jose Ronald V. Valles said easing foreign equity restrictions could attract more investment in the power industry.\nHe said amending the charter would help in “fostering infrastructure development, modernization and expansion, (and) spark greater competition within the industry, potentially leading to improved service quality and lower prices.”\nMr. Valles added that more foreign investors could “address potential shortages and enhance the nation’s preparedness for future energy demand by diversifying investment sources… and… contribute to the broader economic growth and development by fostering a more dynamic and competitive power sector.”\nLawyer Neri J. Colmenares said opening the public utilities sector to more foreign ownership poses national security risks.\n“If China, for example, controls our big generation and distribution utilities, a little commotion in the South China Sea and they could black out Luzon,” he told the panel.\n"

    "text": "\nPROF. XIAOBING LI'S new book, China's New Navy: The Evolution of PLAN from the People's Revolution to a 21st Century Cold War, on the history of the People's Republic of China's PLA Navy (PLAN), is a lively and useful read, starting at the PLAN's beginnings as a riverine Navy, to today's global blue water competitor to the United States.\nThe book is a history, not a policy prescription, and covers events through 2013, not 2023. The earliest chapters cover the PLAN's fighting rÃ´le in the Korean War and follows with the stories of frequent combat between PLAN and Republic of China (ROC: Taiwan) Navy vessels in the latter half of the 1950s, which, if occurring today, would rivet the world's attention. He describes PLAN's support to North Vietnam in its war against the Republic of Vietnam and its US and other allies, where PLAN personnel were often bombed while firing antiquated anti-aircraft guns in North Vietnam.\nLi addresses the low points of the PLAN, when its authorized forays into manufacturing and commercial shipping were part of its financing, and which led to widespread corruption among officers.\nPLAN successes were immense in building a true-blue water navy. In 1974, PLAN fielded its own domestically-created and-built nuclear submarine, after the USSR refused to transfer nuclear powered boats or technology. However, sales of Russian conventional warships and airplanes, and conventional submarines would pick up again after the fall of the USSR. By 1982, PLAN had launched its first missile from a sub, and the 1980s saw PLAN field SSBN nuclear subs each with 12 ballistic missiles.\nIn 1996, PLAN and the Communist Party (CCP) leadership tried to influence the first Taiwanese election since 1949, which included aircraft incursions and firing missiles into Taiwan's waters. Taiwan was assisted by a spy in the PLA senior ranks who provided the whole influence plan to Taiwan, which included CCP instructions that the PLA should not create a real fight with the US and Taiwanese. US Pres. Bill Clinton sent two US carriers into Taiwanese waters, one very close to Taiwan and one 350 miles offshore.\nThe face-off caused the CCP efforts to aid their favored presidential candidate to fail, but also led the PLAN to receive decades of continued increases in funding to build a navy which could face down such an action in the future. By 2010, naval growth was part of an enormous boost for the PRC's shipbuilding industry, replacing South Korea as the largest in the world with 43 percent of world capacity and the ability to produce 65-million tons of shipping each year. By 2011, the PRC was the world's second largest economy.\nBy 2020, PLAN had 240,000 officers and sailors and 350 combat vessels, with 15,000 marines, and 26,000 naval aviation supporting 690 aircraft.\nOther books are needed to fill the most recent years as it is now clear PLAN's fortifications in the South China Sea and the threat of war against Taiwan need to be assessed.\nBrent Sadler's Approach: Mr Sadler's book, US Naval Power in the 21st Century: A New Strategy For Facing the Chinese and Russian Threat, is written by a former submariner and senior staff officer to the higher echelons of the US Navy. Predictably, he argues for a bigger US Navy with more ships and more infrastructure such as shipyards to build and repair the ships. Sadler, like most US naval officers, believes a \"naval based strategy is the best fit for the great power competition of the day\". But it gets better from there.\nThe book is at its most useful in addressing the peacecreated_at use of naval power in the Pacific to be an arm of \"naval statecraft\", and how the US Navy and diplomats can help countries threatened by the PLAN become US allies. One example he cites is Malaysia, where in 2019 the PRC Coast Guard was making it impossible for a Malaysian-engaged vessel to explore for oil in Malaysia's exclusive economic zone to do its survey work. The US Navy rolled into the area and stayed, creating new facts on the ground which led the PRC to stop its harassing action based on claims these waters belonged to the PRC. Sadler points out that after the naval patrols, the US Secretary of State then issued the first clear US policy views on the conflicting Malaysian and PRC claims, and stated the PRC claims were \"unlawful\".\nIt is the proper choreography which Sadler highlights: the announcement coming after the US Navy had done its work and not before which made this such a success. He believes this type of activity creates an \"economic-military nexus of naval affairs\" which creates a \"compelling value proposition\" for ASEAN.\nThe book similarly addresses the enhanced security relationship between the US and the Philippines, particularly after the Rodrigo Duterte presidency, and the ascension of current Pres. Ferdinand Marcos.\nSeveral charts in the book are thought-provoking: the first shows the created_at necessary to have US vessels depart various US home ports to steam to potential conflict areas. From San Diego to Guam is nine days, with five additional days to the South China Sea, and San Diego to the Strait of Hormuz is 27 days. At normal steaming speeds it takes eight days to sail from Norfolk, Virginia, to the Greenland/Iceland Gap where Russian submarines may \"flood\" out of their usual defensive enclave off the Kola peninsula in northern Arctic areas. It is nine days' sail from Norfolk to Gibraltar, five more to the Suez canal, and six days to the Strait of Hormuz: a total of 20 days. A direct sail from the US East Coast without the Suez canal, transiting the Cape of Good Hope to Hormuz is more than 35 days. It's clear why the US should be concerned about the US Navy being over-stretched and overtaxed as the PRC keeps launching submarines, destroyers, and cruisers of high quality.\nA second map shows the expansion of two major bases on PRC territory, the Zhanjiang South Sea Fleet HQ and the Yulin Naval base on Hainan, the latter of which includes a new drydock to build supercarriers, and facilities to house a carrier battle group, and a large submarine base and accommodations for other warships.\nBut it is the other bases not in PRC territory which are most striking, located in the South China Sea, which have been occupied and built-out as full naval and air bases: they include Fiery Cross, with a 10,500ft. runway, and 4,300ft. pier and missile launchers; Subi Reef (9,800ft. runway and 3,650ft. pier), and Mischief Reef, (8,900ft. runway and 6,370ft. pier). All are heavily defended facilities intended to permit the PRC to project against the nearby nations of the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam, and encircle Taiwan from the South.\nSadler does not make the Russian Navy out to be a greater power than it is. He describes Russia's only current aircraft carrier, the 43,000 ton Admiral Kuznetsov, built by the Black Sea Shipyard in the Crimea and delivered in 1990. Her unfinished sister ship in the same yard ended up sold for scrap value but underwent a metamorphosis to become the Liaoning, the first PLAN aircraft carrier. The Kuznetsov, while under modernization and repair, was damaged when its floating dry dock sank in October 2018, and at another yard suffered a fire in December 2019.\nIronically, Crimea remains the only Russian shipyard which can build larger vessels, and it has turned out the two largest ships in the Russian rebuilding program, 25,000-ton landing ships. (Smaller landing vessels, such as three Ropucha 1-class landing ships, have been sunk by Ukraine, including most recently the c5,000 ton Caesar Kuniko on February 15, 2024).\nSadler addresses the US Navy's shortcomings in fleet structure for tomorrow's contested areas of operation, including the lack of smaller (diesel) US submarines which could operate in shallow seas near Taiwan. He points out all US subs are quite large, are nuclear powered and need deeper seas and stealth to operate.\nHe calls the Navy to task for having too few smaller logistic and amphibious ships and small but lethal expeditionary ships. In short, he believes the fleet must be in a very fast transition, and while doing so, has to build forward repair and reloading capabilities as well. The book calls for reinforcing hulls of ships to counter PLAN and PRC Coast Guard collision likely to occur in the gray zone encounters.\nSadler gives his detailed thinking on changes in US fleet design for the future, including a future mix of vessels and robotic advances. He acknowledges the necessity to diminish reliance on large surface combat ships and the need to increase use of unmanned vessels. Since the cost of such a fleet rebuild would be very high, and US shipbuilding capacity is limited compared with the surge capacity that won World War II, the US Navy will be forced to rely on autonomous unmanned aircraft, submersibles, and other vehicles: there is simply no real 3, 2024 defense & foreign affairs strategic policy 17. alternative in the short run. - SR\n"

    "created_at": "2024-03-01",
    "text": "\nSpaceX's ambitious plan to expand its Starlink satellite services to Vietnam has hit a significant roadblock due to the country's stringent foreign ownership laws. Despite initial negotiations and a successful pilot program involving the Vietnamese Coast Guard, the talks have been indefinitely paused, casting doubt on the future of Starlink in Vietnam.\nForeign Ownership Restrictions Halt Progress\nVietnam's telecommunications landscape is tightly regulated, with a clear mandate that foreign entities can only hold up to a 50% non-controlling stake in companies operating network infrastructure within its borders. This regulation has become a stumbling block for SpaceX, which has been seeking an exemption to fully roll out its Starlink services in Vietnam. The company's efforts to negotiate a suitable arrangement have been met with resistance, leading to an impasse. According to sources, this deadlock has resulted in the suspension of Starlink's pilot services for the Vietnam Coast Guard, which had been using the satellite network for drone navigation in strategic maricreated_at regions like the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand.\nImpact on Military and Telecommunications Strategy\nThe suspension of Starlink services poses significant implications for Vietnam's military and telecommunications strategy. The Coast Guard's adoption of Starlink for drone navigation highlights the critical role of satellite services in modern maricreated_at security operations. Furthermore, SpaceX's discussions on providing technology for Vietnam's military outposts suggest a potential strategic partnership that is now in jeopardy. The ongoing revision of Vietnam's telecommunications law, set to take effect in July, does not seem to offer any concessions to foreign satellite service providers like SpaceX, further complicating the situation.\nFuture of Starlink in Vietnam Remains Uncertain\nThe stalemate between SpaceX and Vietnamese authorities raises questions about the future of satellite communications in the country. While Starlink's innovative technology has the potential to revolutionize connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas, the current regulatory environment poses a significant barrier. The outcome of these negotiations will not only affect SpaceX's expansion plans but also set a precedent for future foreign investments in Vietnam's telecommunications sector. As the legal landscape evolves, all eyes will be on how both parties navigate these challenges in pursuit of mutually beneficial solutions.\nAs the situation unfolds, the broader implications for international satellite service providers looking to operate in markets with strict foreign ownership laws become clear. The case of Starlink in Vietnam may serve as a cautionary tale, underscoring the importance of understanding and adapting to local regulatory frameworks. With the advancements in satellite technology outpacing legislative reforms in many countries, finding common ground is essential for unlocking the potential of global satellite connectivity.\n"

    "created_at": "2024-03-01",
    "text": "\nThe Chinese Mission to the EU on Friday expressed the strongest opposition to and condemnation of the European Parliament (EP) and said China was \"extremely shocked\" by its outrageous claims challenging the one-China principle, after the EP published a report saying that \"neither Taiwan nor China is subordinate to the other.\"\nExperts regarded the EP's move as extremely irresponsible and crossing China's red line, warning that if it continues on the wrong path, it could bring a heavy blow to China-Europe relations and even drag the bloc into a potential conflict in the Taiwan Straits.\nThe EP issued two pivotal reports on foreign policy and defense on Thursday, making unwarranted accusations against China on a number of issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and the South China Sea. \nThe move was hyped by foreign media as \"signaling a significant shift in support toward Taiwan,\" as it boldly stated, in assertive language never used before, that Taiwan is not a subordinate of China, while encouraging official delegations from Parliament committees to visit the island. \nA spokesperson with the Chinese Mission to the EU rebutted the reports on Friday, saying that they have seriously trampled on international law and the basic principles of international relations, infringed on China's sovereignty, and grossly interfered in China's internal affairs. \nBy openly advocating \"one China, one Taiwan,\" the reports challenged the one-China principle, promoted \"Taiwan independence,\" and exposed some European politicians' ignorance of history and facts, revealing their dark intention to obstruct China's reunification, the spokesperson said.\nExperts suggested that the audacious remarks by the EP are in line with its hard-line stance toward China. \"Although the EP is an official institution of the EU, many of its resolutions do not have legal effect, thus making it prone to extreme positions on China policies,\" Sun Keqin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global created_ats on Friday.\nSun said the EP's move could become a very serious event in China-Europe relations as it has \"crossed the red line,\" with the phrases used in the reports suggesting a departure from the EU's previous commitments.\nWhen establishing diplomatic relations with China in 1975, the EU explicitly committed to adopting the position accepted by China on the Taiwan question -there is only one China in the world, with Taiwan being an inalienable part of China. The EU had also committed to refraining from maintaining any official relations or entering into any agreements with Taiwan, the spokesperson with the Chinese mission reiterated on Friday.\n\"China must be unified, and it will be. No one, no force can stop it,\" the spokesperson stressed.\nThe Chinese mission urged the EP to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop making irresponsible remarks, and do more things that are beneficial to the development of China-Europe relations. \"Do not make a fool of yourselves in front of the world again,\" it said. \nObservers suggested there are several reasons behind such remarks by the EP, including rising anti-China sencreated_atnt instigated by the US, and the influence of this year's EP election with some playing the China card to win more votes. \nBehind all this is the US holding the puppet strings, and the EP has served as a stepping stone for the US to test China's reaction, Sun said. \nThe reports came soon after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi paid a visit to Europe to attend the Munich Security Conference in late February, where he also met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez Pérez-Castejón and French President Emmanuel Macron. \nChina and Europe still have great potential for deepening cooperation in a number of fronts, not only in trade and economy but also in global governance. There is no fundamental conflict of interests between the two sides, and at a created_at when Europe is embroiled in internal and surrounding struggles, China can be a reliable partner to depend on, experts said. \nHowever, if the EP continues on the wrong path, it will be very dangerous, potentially bringing a heavy blow to the hard-won stability in China-Europe ties, and could even drag the bloc into a potential conflict in the Taiwan Straits, Sun warned. \n"

    "text": "\n The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Office of the National Security Adviser (NSA) welcomed the Senate approval last Monday on third and final reading the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Bill. Shepherded by the Senate special committee on Philippine maricreated_at and admiralty zones chaired by Senator Francis 'Tol' Tolentino, the legislative measure was unanimously voted as Senate Bill (SB) 2492.\nThe DFA headed by Secretary Enrique Manalo congratulated Tolentino for 'this landmark legislation' that will codify the status and regime of the waters inside the archipelagic baselines, redefines the extent of Philippine territorial sea, and claims a 24-nautical mile contiguous zone, among others.\nOn the same vein, NSA Secretary Eduardo Año lauded the 24 Senators led by Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri for advancing SB 2492 at the legislative mills. Once this measure is approved into law, the NSA chief believes, this will definitely help enforce the 2016 Arbitral Award in favor of the Philippines.\nAño looks forward to the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones as a law that will not only reaffirm the country's sovereign rights over the nation's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) but also establishes clear guidelines for the delineation of maricreated_at zones, including sea lanes, air routes and the utilization of natural resources within our jurisdiction.\nSB 2492 is the counterpart version of House Bill (HB) No. 7819 approved and transmitted to the Senate last year. The twin measures were included in the list of priority bills agreed upon at the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC) chaired by President Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos Jr. (PBBM). The DFA highlighted the significance of the twin bills as 'a crucial step for the Philippines to put its archipelagic house in order and to harmonize its domestic law' with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n'We look forward to its enactment so that Philippines could effectively enforce its relevant domestic laws and related international laws to protect its marine and fish resources, preserve and conserve its marine environment and enhance maricreated_at safety and security,' the DFA Secretary pointed out.\nIn our Kapihan sa Manila Bay news forum last Wednesday, Sen. Tolentino expressed his confidence that both chambers of the 19th Congress will be able to ratify the consolidated version of this twin legislative bills before they adjourn for the Holy Week on March 22. Sen. Tolentino sees no hitch that PBBM will be able to sign it into law before the second regular sessions of the 19th Congress adjourn sine die in June this year.\nTolentino conceded the existing Philippine Baseline Laws are obviously insufficient. Baselines serve as basis for a country's maricreated_at jurisdiction and a means to establish maricreated_at boundaries with neighboring coastal States. For the longest created_at, he noted, the Philippines invoked international rules and laws - being a signatory-country to the UNCLOS along with 136 other signatories. And lately, the Arbitral decision at The Hague that ruled against Beijing's imaginary 'nine-dash line' claims on the South China Sea (SCS).\nWith the full support of the respective Secretaries of the present DFA and the NSA, Tolentino declared the enactment of this legislative measure will finally enforce our country's sovereign claims all over our maricreated_at borders in the West Philippine Sea (WPS). From north to south, west-to-east of the Philippines, Tolentino gestured to underscore how the soon-to-become law strengthens the hands of the government against the continuing intimidation, harassments and other transgressions in the disputed areas at Bajo de Masinloc (Scarborough Shoal), Ayungin Shoal and other parts in the WPS.\nIt was the late Senator Arturo Tolentino who authored the country's first-ever Baseline Law, Sen. Tolentino recalled.\nBut he quickly added he was not related to the former Minister of Foreign Affairs. Thus, the upcoming new law is '30 years in the making' that was started in 1984 by the elder Tolentino. On April 17, 2009 former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed into law Republic Act (RA) 9522. This was immediately protested by China and Vietnam.\n'All of these maricreated_at laws would further support a lot of our claims, the EEZ, the contiguous seas, sea lanes, the freedom of navigation, especially our blue economy,' Tolentino asserted.\nAnother proposed legislation authored by Sen. Tolentino is the bill to establish the Philippine Archipelagic Sea Lanes, which can add teeth to our domestic laws and help support to our WPS claims.\nA lawyer by profession and earned post-graduate studies on international laws, Sen. Tolentino explained that this legislative measure officially declares the Philippines as adopting the Arbitral ruling as part of our country's statutes. Thus, he stressed, the Philippines reiterates we did not and never lost ownership even of the artificial islands like those in Fiery Reef and Mischief Reef that China built within our country's 200-mile EEZ.\n'We have to domesticate international law and for the first created_at, we will now have a law rather than dakdak lang tayo ng dakdak (just talk a lot) in the past while China, perhaps, dedma lang tayo nila (only ignores us),' Sen. Tolentino pointed out.\n'Let us not forget about the $900 million up to $1.5 billion of our country's maricreated_at resources - the fishes, our lapu-lapu, maya-maya, our coral reefs, etc.,' he cited.\nSpeaking of coral reefs, Sen. Tolentino last week filed a Senate Resolution that sought to investigate the damages caused reportedly by cyanide fishing around the Scarborough Shoal. This Resolution was referred for 'inquiry in aid of legislation' by the Senate committee on environment chaired by veteran Senator Cynthia Villar.\nWithout accusing any particular culprit, Tolentino clarified that officials of our own Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources will be invited to shed light on the state of bio-diversity in the affected fishing grounds. He noted with satisfaction that the President has already instructed the Department of Justice to conduct 'internal investigations' into such reported cyanide fishing incidents.\n'Whoever is the culprit must pay for the damages,' Tolentino demanded. He cited international 'precedent' cases where the governments exacted damages from country-parties involved.\nFor now, we could only count upon the upcoming law bruited about to fully owning without a doubt and exploiting our WPS blue economy.\n"

    "text": "\nABSTRACT\nKevin Rudd, The Avoidable War: The Dangers of a Catastrophic Conflict between the US and Xi Jinping’s China. New York: Public Affairs, 2022, 379 pp. (hardcover). ISBN: 9781541701298\nFULL TEXT\nThe Avoidable War by Kevin Rudd explores the dangers of a plausible conflict between the USA and Xi Jinping’s China. As a former Australian Prime Minister and experienced diplomat, including a posting to Beijing, Rudd presents a well-researched and analytical assessment of the current geopolitical landscape and the potential triggers for a conflict between the two superpowers. He is one of the very few individuals who can provide reliable insights into the minds of the leaders whose decisions determine whether a war should be fought. The Avoidable War explores both the USA’s and China’s actions by clarifying and interpreting them in the interests of the other. The book aims to determine what minimal strategic framework can still be developed between the two nations to avoid war. As an experienced diplomat in China, Rudd wrote this book in a first-person narration with real-life instances. This work is a comparative and neutral analysis of the actions and policies of the USA and China, similar to a policy briefing with facts and analyses.\nThe book begins by exploring the historical relationship between the USA and China, highlighting the complex nature of their interactions over the past century. Rudd argues that the current tensions are rooted in the fundamental differences between the two countries’ political systems and ideologies, and the perception of a zero-sum game in their economic and strategic competition. He delves into the domestic political dynamics of both countries, emphasising the role of nationalism and populism in shaping public opinion towards the other. According to Rudd, the ‘Chinese Communist Party has seen the United States, uniquely among the Western democracies, as hostile to its ideological interests and a continuing challenge to its efforts to secure and sustain political power’ (p. 36). To him, the Chinese state-owned enterprises and private firms helped rebuild the party’s economic credibility and popular legitimacy after the dark events of 1989 and the earlier ravages of the Cultural Revolution.\nRudd argues that China’s rise should be respected as it conformed to the existing international order’s rules, norms, institutions on security, the economy and climate. Yet Rudd also recognises that there is significant distrust between the USA and China that makes such an accommodation difficult. From Washington’s perspective, the USA’s primacy is based on the ‘rules-based order’, which it seeks to uphold. The Chinese view of the American strategy is nothing more than the prosecution of its core national interests and considers its own rise as peaceful in comparison. According to Rudd, Beijing also considers the USA to be hypocritical, especially on the question of human rights, with its own serious racial and ethnic discrimination problems domestically. On the other hand, the USA believes that Beijing has been actively deceptive for decades about its long-term strategic intentions, betraying the explicit content and implicit spirit of the contract it agreed to with the international community in 2001 when China was first welcomed into the WTO.\nRudd elaborates his understanding of Xi Jinping’s worldview, drawing ‘Ten Concentric Circles of Interest’, starting from the most important concerning Xi’s position in the party itself, and moving out to other domestic political priorities and then to his unfolding international aspirations for the country. Xi’s top priority is to ensure that the Communist Party remains permanently in power, and he remains its paramount leader. Rudd argues that Xi’s efforts to sustain an authoritarian state are aided by a vast new array of technological tools of political control beyond the imaginings of any Chinese emperor in history. He goes on to outline the various flashpoints in the US–China relationship, including Taiwan, the South China Sea and the North Korean nuclear issue. He argues that the risk of a catastrophic conflict has increased due to the shifting balance of power and the lack of effective communication channels between the two sides. He emphasises the need for the USA and China to find a new strategic framework to manage their differences, based on mutual respect and understanding. Other commentators have broadly agreed with this outlook, with Mahbubani, K. (2022) noting that ‘one thing is certain, the geopolitical contest that has broken out between America and China will continue for the next decade or two’.\nThe book provides a detailed understanding of Xi Jinping’s worldview, starting with the most important, his position in the Communist Party, and moving outward to his international aspirations for China. Rudd argues that as Xi identifies seven sensitive topics that cannot be subject to academic discussion or debate. The book also explores Xi’s efforts to sustain an authoritarian state, aided by a vast new array of technological tools of political control. The strength of this book lies in its thorough analysis of the various factors that contribute to the US–China tensions. Rudd provides a nuanced perspective on the complex relationship between the two countries, highlighting the different perspectives and interests, that drive their behaviour. He also presents a compelling argument for the urgent need to find a new strategic framework to avoid a catastrophic conflict. Another strength of the book is its balanced approach. Rudd avoids taking a one-sided approach and instead presents a nuanced analysis of the issues. He acknowledges the concerns and interests of both countries and presents a compelling argument for the need for dialogue and mutual understanding.\nHowever, one key weakness of the book is that it is overly focused on the US–China relationship and does not fully address the role of other major actors in the international system, such as Russia and the European Union, in shaping the geopolitical landscape. Additionally, while Rudd offers many insightful recommendations, he does not fully explore the practical challenges of implementing them in the current political climate. A final problem with Rudd’s argument is that it focuses on the risks of conflict and does not explore the potential benefits of cooperation between the USA and China. While it is important to understand the risks, it is also important to explore the opportunities that exist for cooperation in areas such as climate change, economic development and global governance.\nOverall, The Avoidable War is a created_atly and valuable contribution to the ongoing discussion on the US–China relationship. Kevin Rudd’s insights and recommendations provide a roadmap for policymakers and scholars to navigate the complex geopolitical landscape and find a path towards a more stable and peaceful future. It is a highly recommended book for anyone interested in the US–China relationship and the potential risks associated with their escalating tensions. Kevin Rudd’s expertise and insights offer a valuable perspective on the geopolitical landscape and the urgent need for a new strategic framework to avoid a catastrophic conflict.\nBibliography\nREFERENCE\nMahbubani K.,  (2022).

    "text": "\nPRESIDENT Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday sought the support of Australia and other allies in its maricreated_at disputes with China, saying the Philippines is on the frontline against actions that undermine peace and stability in the region. However, he vowed that the country will not yield.\nIn his address before the Australian Parliament in Canberra, Marcos said he would not allow any foreign power to take \"even one square inch\" of the country's territory, and that the Philippines remained firm in defending its sovereignty.\n\"As in 1942, the Philippines now finds itself on the frontline against actions that undermine regional peace, erode regional stability, and threaten regional success. Then as now, we remain firm in defending our sovereignty, our sovereign rights, our jurisdiction,\" Marcos said.\n\"I shall never tire of repeating the declaration that I made from the first day that I took office: I will not allow any attempt by any foreign power to take even one square inch of our sovereign territory. The challenges that we face may be formidable, but equally formidable is our resolve. We will not yield,\" he added.\nThe President earlier described as \"worrisome\" recent developments in the West Philippine Sea, including the presence of Chinese Navy ships and the jamming of electronic communications of Philippine vessels.\nThe Philippine leader emphasized that peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region has come \"under threat.\"\n\"Today, we add a further dimension to that relationship as we address concerns on our security and defense. We are called upon once again to join forces, together with our partners, in the face of threats to the rule of law, to stability, and to peace,\" Marcos said.\n\"Once again, we must come as partners to face the common challenges confronting the region. Not one single country can do this by itself. No single force can counter them by themselves,\" he added.\nThe President said the protection of the South China Sea as a vital, critical, global artery is crucial to the preservation of regional peace and global peace.\n\"Then as now, the security and continued prosperity of the region - of countries like Australia - relies upon that effort. Just as we fought to build our rules-based international order, so are we now fighting to protect it,\" he said.\n\"We have an abiding interest in keeping our seas free and open and in ensuring unimpeded passage and freedom of navigation. We must uphold, preserve, and defend the unified and universal character of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as the constitution of the oceans,\" he added.\nMarcos said the Philippines and Australia \"must reinforce each other's strength\" and \"protect the peace we have fought for in the war and have jealously guarded in the decades since.\"\n\"In Australia, we see a natural partner in our efforts to defend, to preserve, to uphold our open, inclusive, and rules-based international order, to ensure that it remains governed by international law and informed by the principles of equity and justice,\" Marcos said.\n\"In Australia, we see a lifelong friend with whom we have endured joint sacrifices, reveled in our shared victories, and now pursue common aspirations,\" he added.\nMarcos noted that the strategic partnership between the Philippines and Australia has become vital to countering and resolving geopolitical polarities and strategic competitions that threaten peace in the region.\n\"Geopolitical polarities and strategic competitions threaten our hard-won peace even as we remain beset by unresolved inequities and inequalities within and amongst nations,\" Marcos said.\n\"Powerful and transformative technologies can destabilize our political and social order, climate change threatens our very existence. These tectonic shifts are acutely felt in the Indo-Pacific,\" he added.\nFormal diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Australia span 78 years since they were established on July 4, 1946. The partnership was elevated from comprehensive to strategic during the state visit of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to the Philippines in September last year.\nSome 560 Filipino soldiers, 1,200 Australian servicemen and 120 US marines joined Exercise Alon in September 2023, an amphibious exercise organized by the Philippines and Australia.\nMarcos is in Canberra for a two-day state visit upon the invitation of the Australian government. He will return to Australia next week for a commemorative summit between Australia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).\n\"Beyond our bilateral horizon, we project the commitment in our continued adherence to Asean Centrality, which we will have the opportunity to reaffirm at the Special Summit between Asean and Australia in Melbourne next week,\" Marcos said.\n\"Beyond the region, we project this commitment, too, in our partnership and active leadership on the international stage. We collaborate closely with Australia to strengthen international security and universal adherence to international humanitarian law,\" he added.\nMarcos thanked Albanese for his personal commitment to the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons as he thanked Australia for standing for the Philippines as he emphasized that the governments cannot allow geopolitics to paralyze global governance.\n\"Through the treaties of Bangkok and Rarotonga, our two regions serve as pockets of freedom from these destructive weapons. Within the ambit of the Asean Regional Forum and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, our two countries are champions of nuclear disarmament and advocates for nuclear risk reduction,\" Marcos said.\n\"In the context of emerging technologies such as autonomous weapon systems, and of new frontiers such as outer space and cyberspace, there is much room for our two countries to work together,\" he added.\nOn climate change, Marcos emphasized the need for multilateralism to work to address the most pressing vulnerability issues that threaten \"the very survival of our peoples\" and \"our very future.\"\nHe said that the Philippines accepts its part in the collective responsibility as he highlighted the administration's commitment to accelerating just, affordable, sustainable and inclusive energy transition toward carbon neutrality.\n\"Our past successes should inspire us to forge ahead in building the future to which we aspire. For the Philippines, we continue to see that future in our identity as Asians and as members of the Pacific family,\" he added\n\"Together with our Asian neighbors - and in that group I include Australia - we continue to work for a regional community that empowers all of our citizens,\" he added.\nBefore concluding his speech, Marcos also highlighted the vibrant people-to-people relationship between the Philippines and Australia, which is evident to the almost 35,000 Filipino students who choose Australian schools to pursue their respective endeavors and nearly 30,000 Australians who chose to work and live in the Philippines.\n\"Looking ahead, I am confident that Filipinos and Australians will remain steadfast partners, unyielding and uncompromising in our shared values, and energized as we gird ourselves to work together in the spirit of bayanihan and of mateship,\" he said.\nAgreements signed\nFollowing his address to the Australian parliament, Marcos witnessed the signing of three agreements covering maricreated_at domain, cyber and critical technology, and effective implementation of antitrust laws and policies of the two countries.\n\"The three agreements exchanged today shall enhance information sharing, capability building, and interoperability between our relevant government agencies in the maricreated_at domain and maricreated_at environment, cyber and critical technology, and competition law,\" Marcos said during his joint press conference with Albanese.\n\"The three agreements add to the more than 120 agreements that our two countries have signed through the decades. And these are in various fields, including defense cooperation, air services, education, research, scientific and cultural cooperation,\" he added.\nThe agreement on maricreated_at domain seeks to enhance cooperation between the two countries for strengthened civil military cooperation, promote international law and rules-based international order, safeguard the marine environment and cultural heritage, enhance defense engagements, and establish avenues for dialogue among relevant agencies of the two countries.\nThe Cyberspace Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), meanwhile, looks to ramp up Philippines-Australia cooperation on cyber and critical technology, promote a secure digital economy and share information and best practices with Australia.\nOn the other hand, the Antitrust MoU aims at a more effective implementation of the respective competition laws and policies of the Philippines and Australia, and looks for practical ways to strengthen economic relations through the sharing of best practices and the conduct of capacity building on matters involving merger regulations, competition laws, and investigative techniques relevant to implementing competition laws.\nThe three agreements are in addition to those signed during Albanese's visit to Manila last year.\n\"The prime minister and I both agreed to continue to look for ways to explore every option possible, to bring our countries closer than ever and collectively, with optimism and hopeful outlook, to be a force of good, unity, stability and prosperity in our region,\" Marcos said.\nAbout 30 protesters from the militant group Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) in Australia and several other groups had converged outside parliament to protest the visit of President Marcos.\nApart from Bayan, \"solidarity formations\" from Sydney and Melbourne, as well as the state of Queensland joined the protest against Marcos.\nFour Australian senators, Janet Rice, David Shoebridge, Jordon Steele-John and Barbara Pocock, all from the Greens party, joined the Filipino protesters outside parliament.\nRice was the first to openly protest Marcos' presence at the Australian parliament, holding out a sign saying, \"Stop human rights abuses.\" She was later censured for \"unparliamentary conduct.\"\n"

    "created_at": "2024-03-01",
    "text": "\nThe House Science, Space and Technology Committee issued the following testimony by Arati Prabhakar, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, involving a hearing on Feb. 15, 2024, entitled \"Examining Federal Science Agency Actions to Secure the U.S. Science and Technology Enterprise\":\n* * *\nI would like to thank Chairman Lucas, Ranking Member Lofgren, and the members of this committee for the invitation to address the subject of research security.\nBefore my current role as the President's science and technology (S&T) advisor and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), I spent half my professional life in public service, including as Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The other half of my career has been in the private sector, in a couple of companies and a decade in early-stage venture capital.\nWhen President Biden asked me to step into my current role, I immediately said \"yes\". I've been able to contribute to American innovation from so many different places, and I know that it takes the whole ecosystem--public and private--to do big things for our country. That is how we create the advances that change Americans' lives.\nOSTP is the one place that works with, looks across, and supports the entire S&T ecosystem. Our mission is to strengthen America's science, technology, and innovation, and to make sure the enterprise is aimed at our country's great aspirations. These include strengthening our economy, achieving robust health and opportunity for every person, meeting the climate crisis, and bolstering global peace and stability.\nToday, the global strategic environment is characterized by fierce military and economic competition among many actors. I will focus on the People's Republic of China (PRC), because it is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and the ability to harness significant military and economic power to advance that objective. This is evident in the PRC's actions ranging from its conduct in the South China Sea, to atrocities in Xinjiang, to its state-centric approach to product standards.\nTechnology and research and development (R&D) are central to this competition. I would like to put the PRC's efforts in perspective and then outline the actions of the Biden-Harris Administration.\nThe PRC's spending on R&D has grown from $14 billion in 1996 to $670 billion in 2021 in purchasing power parity, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This is an unprecedented surge, which puts the PRC into second place behind the United States' $800 billion in R&D expenditures in 2021. The PRC's spending is more than 40 percent greater than the entire European Union's R&D funding.\nThe PRC is pouring this funding into many fields and research facilities. Both diplomatic reporting and observations among U.S. researchers indicate how the PRC is seeking to become the focal point for many areas of R&D. These efforts include offers to host R&D activities and facilities, invitations to participate in PRC experiments, and diplomatic efforts to host major scientific meetings and conferences in critical and emerging technology areas.\nThe PRC's R&D and manufacturing priorities include its intent to be the world-leading developer in areas such as:\n* Artificial intelligence\n* Quantum information sciences\n* Semiconductors\n* New materials\n* Smart manufacturing and robotics\n* Brain science\n* Genetics and biotechnology\n* Deep space exploration\nYou will note many similarities if you compare their list to prior and current U.S. Critical and Emerging Technologies lists.\nEvery developing and developed economy pumps funding into R&D, pursues global partnerships, and seeks to trade in high-tech goods. What distinguishes the PRC is its use of illicit as well as licit means to acquire foreign technologies, its engagement in unfair competition in targeted industries, its mandatory strategy of military-civil fusion, and a general lack of transparency.\nTo face down this challenge, President Biden has taken unprecedented action.\nTo protect national security, this Administration has levied record fines for export control violations, established new export controls on semiconductors, and expanded controls on outbound investment from the U.S. in certain sensitive technologies and products. We are rebuilding America's lead in semiconductors with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. The Department of Justice has pursued numerous cases related to trade secret theft and economic espionage. These actions are oriented toward industry, the source of high-tech products and significant technology development.\nTo address risks to research security, the Administration is implementing National Security Presidential Memorandum 33 (NSPM-33) and provisions of the CHIPS and Science Act. Here, the purpose is to make sure that universities and other academic institutions understand the altered global landscape and fulfill their responsibilities as the first line of defense against illicit activity. Unlike proprietary R&D, most academic research is intended for publication and thrives in a global exchange of ideas. But some research can lie close to applications with national security implications. Access to data can lead to unauthorized transfer and use. The PRC has funded hidden parallel labs to replicate research. And as the PRC learns to conduct better and better leading-edge research, it is unfortunately the case that it will use some of that work to America's detriment.\nMembers of the academic research community are still catching up to the changes in geopolitics. Many of the things that researchers were encouraged to do only a decade ago, like help establish laboratories in the PRC, are now being discouraged. This is why we must be abundantly clear with the research community about the ways that the PRC and the Chinese Communist Party have changed; how the PRC's policies and practices differ from U.S. industrial and defense R&D efforts; and the ways in which some research activities in the PRC take and exploit U.S. data or technologies to contribute to human rights abuses, the Ministry of State Security's surveillance apparatus, and military aggression. It is essential that we address these issues.\nThe accompanying increase in scrutiny of U.S. researchers' ties to the PRC has given rise to another essential issue. For many Asians and Asian Americans, research security efforts run the risk of exacerbating anti-Asian sencreated_atnt, which had already increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. That is why the Biden-Harris Administration has been clear that we cannot and will not pursue policies or processes that worsen xenophobia.\nIn addition, as captured in NSPM-33, \"the open and collaborative nature of the United States R&D enterprise underpins America's innovation, S&T leadership, economic competitiveness, and national security.\" It is crucial that we maintain that open and collaborative environment to compete effectively in the global race for science and technology.\nWe are implementing research security with these things in mind, along with our partners in the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the members of the National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Research Security. This includes the release of NSPM-33 implementation guidance in 2022, which consisted of multiple rounds of public consultation with outside stakeholders, research organizations, and members of the Asian-American community.\nLate last year, OMB finalized and the National Science Foundation posted common disclosure forms for use by all agencies as developed by the National Science and Technology Council and required by NSPM-33. This month, OSTP released guidance on the use of these common forms to provide additional clarity to researchers, research institutions, and agencies on how they can use the information disclosed in the forms to make informed decisions about research funding and performance. The forms also make clear that federally funded researchers cannot be members of malign foreign talent recruitment programs, as required by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. In addition, these forms help reduce the overall reporting burden for recipients of federal funds by having clear and consistent requirements across government agencies.\nWe are completing work on the research security programs requirement after receiving extensive public comments on a draft published in the Federal Register in March 2023. These requirements for research security programs at universities will provide clear standards on research security training, cybersecurity, export control training, and foreign travel security. It is vital that these programs be more than a checkbox--that they achieve increased awareness of research security threats and enable researchers and academic institutions to respond appropriately.\nAdditionally, we have released guidelines on foreign talent recruitment programs, as required by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. These guidelines intend to limit conflicts of interest with foreign governments for federally funded researchers, while not disrupting the United States' ability to engage in productive scientific exchanges that are in the national interest.\nIn all of these situations, it is our responsibility as the government to establish clear lines about what is and is not acceptable so that our scientists and engineers can focus on delivering the progress that will maintain America's leading position.\nThere is no question that the PRC is a formidable actor in technology and R&D, with rapid growth, funding, focused efforts, and efforts to systematically collect information that could give it a strategic advantage. American R&D is still strong, but we are no longer the sole big player on the world stage, and we can't rest on our laurels.\nThe bipartisan support of this committee has helped ensure the United States' strong position in R&D across decades. I want to thank you for that consistent dedication. It has shaped the lives of Americans in every part of our Nation, creating jobs, improving health, changing how we connect and live and work, and making every one of us safer and more secure. We must get today's R&D right so that science and technology can continue to help create a better future.\nThank you, and I will be happy to hear your thoughts and questions.\n* * *\nOriginal text here: \nCopyright Targeted News Services\nMSTRUCK-8507701 MSTRUCK\n"

    "title": "DNA metabarcoding reveals ecological patterns and driving mechanisms of archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic communities in sediments of the Sansha Yongle Blue Hole",
    "created_at": "2024-03-15",
    "text": "\nIntroduction\nMarine blue holes are special geological settings formed in the carbonate banks below the sea level and are dark blue in color. They typically have steep-walled structures and stratified water columns characterized by oxygen deficit and high levels of hydrogen sulfide in deep layers,. The water exchange between marine blue holes and the open sea is severely restricted, resulting in a relatively stable environment with unique physical–chemical characteristics inside the holes, such as a stratified water column with a strong thermohaline. The special geographical, physical, and chemical features of marine blue holes make them natural laboratories for studying marine biodiversity, biological adaptation, and evolution, as well as the interaction between biotic and abiotic factors–.\nThe Sansha Yongle Blue Hole (SYBH; 111°46′06′′ E, 16°31′30′′ N), located within a coral reef of the Yongle Atoll among the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea, is the world’s deepest marine blue hole known so far, with the observed deepest portion at 301.19 m below the local 10-year mean sea level. The three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the SYBH showed that the overall shape of the internal structure resembled a ballet dancer’s shoe with two large transitions at 76–78 m and 158 m, and no water or material exchange with the outside open sea. A comprehensive investigation of the hydrochemical and redox properties of the SYBH revealed the existence of two thermoclines, one at 13–20 m and the other at 70–150 m, which divided the water column into five stratified water layers, and the deep water below 90 m was anaerobic. The existing topography and redox gradients in the water column of the SYBH have increased scientists’ interest in the biodiversity and community structure.\nNumerous studies on water column microeukaryotic, and prokaryotic plankton,– including bacteria and archaea have expanded our knowledge of the composition, structure, and potential function of the biological communities in the SYBH. The study by Liu et al. revealed obvious differences in the eukaryotic composition of the water column between the SYBH and the outer reef slope and demonstrated significant effects of turbidity and nitrite concentration on the eukaryotic community structure. Another metabarcoding study suggested that planktonic microeukaryotes in the SYBH were less sensitive to environments but significantly affected by cross-domain biointeraction. Nevertheless, limited information is available concerning the diversity, community structure and spatial distribution of eukaryotic communities in SYBH sediments, and what shapes the eukaryotic assemblages in the sediments remains unclear. For prokaryotes, studies on bacterial community revealed the vertical stratification of community composition in SYBH water column and highlighted the dominance of the phylum Proteobacteria,–. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the SYBH microbial ecosystem was characterized by the presence of unidentified microorganisms in the deep water layer, and a considerable number of new taxa were identified among culturable anaerobic bacteria in SYBH water. However, whether there are also abundant unknown prokaryotic taxa in SYBH sediments remains to be explored.\nWhile previous studies have demonstrated that the geographical isolation and in situ conditions of SYBH contribute to the high microbial and eukaryotic diversity in the water column,,, SYBH sediment microorganisms have been poorly studied. This is because, the location of SYBH in the continental slope of the South China Sea, the presence of submerged reefs and the complex geological structures, limit access to the bottom of SYBH for sediment collection. The 18S ribosomal DNA study of SYBH sediments indicates high vertical diversity of foraminifera that is influenced by in situ O2 conditions and reveals the preference of some foraminiferal taxa for anoxia which may be supported by their ability to denitrify. These findings suggest that SYBH may serve as an excellent natural laboratory to explore additional eukaryotic adaptations associated with anoxia. However, sediment communities have not been well documented in the SYBH, our understanding of the biodiversity and driving factors in SYBH sediments is still limited.\nIn our study, we collected a total of 12 sediment samples from the aerobic slope (3.1–38.6 m depth) and the anaerobic regime (150 m, and 300 m depth) of SYBH and we performed high-throughput sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicons to examine the prokaryotic (archaea and bacteria) and eukaryotic diversity and distribution in SYBH. We combined our sequencing data results with environmental data to: (1) describe the distribution, diversity, and co-occurrence of archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes at different oxygen and geochemical regimes of SYBH; (2) compare the differences in community characteristics between the aerobic and anaerobic zones of SYBH; (3) analyze the main environmental factors that influence the composition of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities in SYBH sediments.\nResults\nEnvironmental metadata for SYBH sampling sites\nThe hydrochemical factors in the water column of SYBH at each sampling site are shown in Table . Temperature, pH and the concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) generally decreased with depth. Temperature and pH decreased from 30 °C and 8.09 at the surface to 15 °C and 7.49 at the bottom, respectively. DO concentration in the upper water column was ~ 233 μmol L−1 and decreased sharply, showing two concentration minima before becoming anoxic below 100 m (Table ). Contrastingly, salinity, ammonia, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), methane, phosphate, silicate, and sulfide increased with depth (from surface to 150 m), maintaining nearly constant levels below 150 m. The concentration of nitrate reached maximum levels at 70 m (5.44 μmol L−1) and then sharply decreased to undetectable levels at a depth of 100 m. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrite, particulate organic carbon (POC), and total suspended solid (TSS) fluctuated multiple created_ats from the surface to the bottom, with a relatively stable trend below 200 m. The concentrations of DOC and POC reached a peak at the depth of 150 m.\nTaxonomic diversity and community composition\nIn the final dataset, we retained 2752 archaeal OTUs representing 223,545 reads, 6266 bacterial OTUs representing 384,644 reads, and 3608 eukaryotic OTUs representing 809,257 reads for downstream analysis (Table ). The number of bacterial OTUs varied greatly among the 12 SYBH sites (SYBH1-SYBH10 aerobic; SYBH11-SYBH12 anaerobic), ranging from 1903 (SYBH9) to 3734 (SYBH11), with an average of 2864 OTUs per site. The difference in the number of eukaryotic OTUs among the 12 SYBH sites was small, ranging from 1056 (SYBH2) to 1615 (SYBH8), with an average of 1412 OTUs per site. The number of archaeal OTUs ranged from 535 (SYBH8) to 1606 (SYBH5), with an average of 965 OTUs per site. The number of bacterial OTUs and eukaryotic reads in the two anoxic sites (SYBH11 and SYBH12) was higher than that in the 10 aerobic sites (Fig. ).\nOur 16S and 18S rRNA gene analysis indicated 16 archaeal, 52 bacterial and 52 eukaryotic phyla. The top three archaeal taxa at the phylum level were Thaumarchaeota, DHVEG-6 and Euryarchaeota (Fig. ). Thaumarchaeota was the most abundant archaeal phylum accounting for 73.49% of the total archaeal reads and occupied the highest proportion of archaeal reads at 10 SYBH sites. DHVEG-6 had the highest proportion of archaeal reads at sites SYBH2 and SYBH9. Euryarchaeota, Bathyarchaeota and Lokiarchaeota presented higher relative abundance in the two anaerobic sites SYBH11 and SYBH12. The top three bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum across all SYBH sites, accounting for 63.36% of the total bacterial reads. Firmicutes occupied a high proportion in the two anaerobic SYBH sites. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria in SYBH11 was the highest among the 12 sites. Cyanobacteria occupied higher relative abundance in the two shallow sites SYBH1 and SYBH2. The eukaryotic community varied greatly in composition across the 12 SYBH sites, showing different abundances at the examined sites. Annelida, Diatomea, and Arthropoda were relatively abundant phyla at all sites. The relative abundance of phylum Phaeophyceae at the aerobic site SYBH4 exceeded 50% but was low in other sites. In the anaerobic sites SYBH11 and SYBH12, the eukaryotic community was dominated by the group of unidentified Eukaryota, and only Diatomea, Chlorophyta and Arthropoda had relative abundances greater than 1%. Additionally, the eukaryotic dataset contained 1005 fungal reads and 50 fungal OTUs representing three phyla (Chytridiomycota, Basidiomycota and Ascomycota). The relative abundance of Fungi was less than 0.3% in all SYBH sites (Table ).\nCommunity composition of archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes at the phylum level (a, c, e) and order level (b, d, f). The UPGMA analysis was performed based on the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index at the phylum level.\nDetailed analysis at the site level revealed clear vertical variations in the alpha diversity of archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes, with different distributions across the 12 sites examined (Fig. ). Notably, the alpha diversity of bacterial community in the anaerobic zone (SYBH11 and SYBH12) was higher than that in the aerobic zone. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) cluster analysis of archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic communities at the phylum level revealed that the two anaerobic sites, SYBH11 and SYBH12, were clustered on the same branch. The order-level analysis further confirmed that the community composition of SYBH11 and SYBH12 was similar. As the redox regime in the water column changed from aerobic to anaerobic/sulfidic, the relative abundance of some taxa such as Bathyarchaeota, Lokiarchaeota, Firmicutes, Thermoplasmatales, Acidimicrobiales, Clostridiales and Desulfobacterales became higher (Fig. ). 2570 out of the 2752 archaeal OTUs were not assigned to any archaeal taxon at the order level, indicating that the vast majority of archaeal OTUs (over 93%) remain unidentified at the order level and below. The remaining 182 archaeal OTUs were attributed to 10 archaeal groups at the order level, of which 147 OTUs belong to Thermoplasmatales, five OTUs belong to Methanosarcinales, five OTUs belong to Cenarchaeales and only one OTU belong to Thermoproteales (Table ). The group of unidentified Thaumarchaeota was represented by five OTUs but accounted for the highest proportion of archaeal reads at the order level (Fig. ). In the bacterial and eukaryotic datasets, the number of OTUs identified at the order level were 4312 and 2553, accounting for 69% and 71% respectively.\nCorrelations between community structure and environmental variables\nTo examine correlations between the dominant phyla and the environmental variables analyzed in this study, we performed nonparametric Spearman’s correlation analysis (Table ). The relative abundance of Euryarchaeota was negatively correlated with nitrate (r = − 0.768, p < 0.01), nitrite (r = − 0.839, p < 0.01), and N2O (r = − 0.837, p < 0.01), but positively correlated with sulfide (r = 0.640, p < 0.05), ammonia (r = 0.723, p < 0.01) and methane (r = 0.792, p < 0.01). The relative abundance of Proteobacteria exhibited positive correlations with nitrate (r = 0.824, p < 0.01), nitrite (r = 0.797, p < 0.01) and N2O (r = 0.802, p < 0.01), but was negatively correlated with sulfide (r = − 0.650, p < 0.05), ammonia (r = − 0.754, p < 0.01) and methane (r = − 0.844, p < 0.01). The relative abundance of Firmicutes was correlated with 11 environmental variables, of which temperature, DO, DOC, POC and pH had negative correlations with Firmicutes, whilst salinity, sulfide, phosphate, silicate, DIC and depth had positive correlations with Firmicutes. The correlations between Firmicutes and temperature and POC were significant (p < 0.01), while the remaining nine correlations were not significant (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Arthropoda and Annelida exhibited a negative correlation with sulfide (p < 0.05). Arthropoda showed a positive correlation with POC (p < 0.05). No significant correlation was detected between the relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota, DHVEG-6, Actinobacteria and Diatomea and the examined environmental variables (p > 0.05).\nResults of Spearman’s correlation analysis of dominant taxa at the phylum level in the archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic communities and the environmental variables examined, such as temperature (T), DO, ammonia, phosphate, N2O, DOC, POC, TSS, and DIC.\n*indicates insignificant correlation (p < 0.05); **indicates significant correlation (p < 0.01).\nRedundancy analysis (RDA) results showed that sulfide, salinity and N2O had great impacts on the archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic communities, among which sulfide was the most important factor affecting the three domains in SYBH sediments. The strongest influence of sulfide was at the two anaerobic sites, SYBH11 and SYBH12. Nitrate, nitrite, TSS and POC had relatively weak effects on the distribution of archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes (Fig. ), but the effects were different for the three domains. As an example, BIOENV analysis revealed that nitrite and pH could best explain the archaeal community structure. In particular, the variation partitioning analysis (VPA) results indicated that nitrite and pH explained 13% of archaeal community variation. Environmental variables that correlated with the bacterial community assemblages included salinity, nitrate, and DO, explaining 22% of the bacterial community variation (Fig. ). For eukaryotes, sulfide influenced the community structure and together with nitrite, explained 22% of community variation (Fig. ).\nRDA for the archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic communities to explore the relationships between community structure and environmental variables. Venn diagrams illustrate the relative contribution of the selected variables in shaping archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic communities as it was evaluated by VPA.\nPartitioning beta-diversity using multiple-site dissimilarity measures showed that the turnover component (βsim) contributed at least eight created_ats more to the Sørensen dissimilarity (βsor) of the archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic communities than the nestedness component (βsne). This indicates that the variation in species composition among sites was affected by species replacement between sites rather than species loss from site to site (Table ).\nResults of partitioning multiple-site beta diversity (βsor) into turnover component (βsim) and nestedness component (βsne) by using Baselga’s method.\nMantel test between the pairwise dissimilarity metrics and the Euclidean distance of environmental factors further revealed that the turnover component (βsim) of Sørensen dissimilarity of the archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic communities was influenced by a wide range of environmental variables, including water depth, temperature, salinity, DO, pH, ammonia, phosphate, silicate, N2O, methane, sulfide and DIC (Fig. ). There were nine significant correlations in the bacterial community, and five significant correlations in the eukaryotic community. Water depth, temperature, pH and methane had significant effects on the βsim of both bacterial and eukaryotic communities (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the βsim of the bacterial and eukaryotic communities was correlated with DOC (p < 0.05). Consistent with the RDA results, the βsim of the three domains was not correlated with nitrate, nitrite, POC and TSS. The nestedness component (βsne) of the three domains was not significantly correlated with environmental variables.\nThe relationships between two β-diversity components (βsim and βsne) and the environmental variables which were determine by Mantel test based on Pearson’s correlations. * indicates insignificant correlation (p < 0.05); ** indicates significant correlation (p < 0.01).\nThe community assembly and co-occurrence network analysis\nThe Sloan neutral community model showed that the R2 values in the archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic communities were 56.02%, 58.78% and 54.81%, respectively (Fig. ). These results indicated that stochastic processes contributed to more than half of the community variations across the three domains. The m value in the bacterial community was the largest (m = 0.7163), followed by that of the archaeal community (m = 0.4565), and the m value in the eukaryotic community was the smallest (m = 0.1814), indicating that the species dispersal of bacteria was relatively high, while the species dispersal in the eukaryotic community was limited.\nFitting of a neutral community model (NCM) to the community assemblage at the OTU level. The frequencies of occurrence of archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes were predicted. The parameters R2 and m represent the fit to the neutral model and the immigration rate, respectively.\nThe bacterial and eukaryotic genera with a relative abundance of more than 0.5% and all archaeal genera were selected to generate the co-occurrence network in the SYBH (Fig. ). The bacterial network was more complex than the archaeal network and eukaryotic network at the genus level (Fig. a-c). The numbers of vertices in the archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic networks at the genus level were 12, 121, and 87, respectively, and their edge numbers were 13, 385, and 291, respectively. The co-occurrence networks constructed based on OTU abundances reflected that the number of positive interactions was close to that of negative interactions (195 vs. 177) in the archaeal network. In the bacterial and eukaryotic networks, most of the interactions were positive, accounting for 82% and 80%, respectively (Fig. d-f). In the archaeal network, most of the keystone OTUs were derived from Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota. Thaumarchaeota had negative interactions with Euryarchaeota and DHVEG-6, and Euryarchaeota showed positive interactions with Lokiarchaeota and Bathyarchaeota. Because only 7% of archaeal OTUs were assigned below the order level, more interactions may occur between archaeal taxa in SYBH, which warrants further investigation. In the bacterial network, most of the keystone OTUs belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria, which had strong positive interactions with Cyanobacteria. Strong negative interactions were observed between Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria. In the eukaryotic network, most of the highly connected OTUs were derived from the Unidentified Eukaryota, indicating putative importance of the unidentified fraction of eukaryotes in SYBH sediments.\nCo-occurrence networks at the genus level (a-c) and at the OTU level (d-f). The networks at the genus level were colored according to the modularity class. In the networks based on OTUs, red lines represent positive interactions among OTUs, and the blue lines represent negative interactions among OTUs.\nDiscussion\nAs the deepest marine blue hole known in the world, Sansha Yongle Blue Hole has high scientific research values and has attracted widespread attention. Our study presented the first DNA metabarcoding dataset covering the three domains of cellular life (archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes) from the SYBH sediment samples. Further it provides a comprehensive analysis of the molecular diversity, community structure and assembly mechanism, and indicates the role of environmental factors in shaping the prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities in the SYBH.\nMarine blue holes are generally characterized by steep physicochemical gradients within geographically restricted areas,, creating conditions for new, unidentified microbial lineages to exist. High-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) retrieved recently from the Amberjack Hole (Gulf of Mexico blue hole) showed that microbial communities were dominated by understudied microbial taxa, indicating high levels of novel microbial lineages in the Amberjack Hole. Similarly, some studies indicated that the microbial ecosystems in SYBH water column were also characterized by unidentified taxa,. A recent study on microbial community in SYBH water samples recovered high-quality MAGs belonging to various uncultivated lineages, reflecting the high novelty of the SYBH microbiome. In this study, 29% of eukaryotic OTUs, 31% of bacterial OTUs, and more than 93% of archaeal OTUs remained unidentified at the order level, indicating the existence of a large number of undocumented prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa in SYBH sediments. The high percentages of undocumented taxa in our study agree with the high number of unidentified lineages in the water column of SYBH,,, which indicates that microorganisms inhabiting SYBH (both sediment and water column) are underrepresented in public databases. This hinders adequate taxonomic identifications of the in situ prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities in SYBH. The presence of high levels of novel lineages in the SYBH is not surprising, as this phenomenon has also been observed in other marine habitats. Recent studies have revealed novel lineages of Southern Ocean deep-sea foraminifera and high genetic novelty of foraminifera on Western Pacific seamounts,. The unique environmental characteristics of habitats such as marine blue holes and seamounts provide conditions for the emergence of new species.\nThis study also revealed the community composition of the three domains at the phylum and order levels. To summarize, the bacterial community in SYBH sediments was dominated by Proteobacteria (Fig. ), which is consistent with the results of bacterial communities in SYBH water,–. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria in deep anaerobic sites was lower than that in upper aerobic sites (Fig. ). This may be mainly related to nutrient availability, as the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly positively correlated with nitrate and nitrite, which were undetectable below 100 m. As for the archaeal community, the study by He et al. revealed the dominance of Euryarchaeota in SYBH water, but a recent study by Chen et al. showed that Nanoarchaeota and Agenigamarchaeota dominated the archaeal community in SYBH water. This divergence in results may be due to differences in the primers used, but the exact cause deserves further exploration. Different from the above research results,, a study on the archaeal communities in the deep-sea sediments of the South China Sea showed that archaeal communities in sediments were dominated by Thaumarchaeota (55%). Our results on the fraction of archaeal community that were able to assign taxonomy confirmed the dominance of Thaumarchaeota, which dominated the archaeal community at 10 SYBH sites with the relative abundance ranging from 43 to 98% (Fig. ). DHVEG-6 was the second most abundant taxon in the archaeal community at the phylum level, with the relative abundance ranging from 2 to 65% across all SYBH sites. The dominant taxa of eukaryotic community varied greatly among the 12 SYBH sites. In aerobic sites, the dominant eukaryotic taxa included Annelida, Arthropoda and Diatomea, while the eukaryotic communities in anaerobic sites were dominated by unidentified Eukaryota. Notably, in the study of SYBH water column by Chen et al., a total of 7888 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were identified from the fungi dataset. However, only a small fraction of fungi (50 fungal OTUs representing 1005 reads) were detected in our eukaryotic dataset (Table ). The fact that our dataset did not recruit many fungal OTUs may be caused by primer specificity, as we used general 18S rRNA primers rather than ITS primers.\nVertical variation is a typical distribution pattern for biological communities in the water column of the SYBH which has been observed in the eukaryotic, and prokaryotic communities,,. The water column in SYBH is generally divided into an aerobic surface layer (at depths of 0–70 m), an intermediate layer (at depths of 70–100 m) and an anoxic bottom layer (below 100 m) along the depth gradient. These different water layers have different microbial compositions and redox processes. Although we did not obtain sediment samples within chemocline (at depths of 70–100 m), our results still clearly reveal vertical changes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities in SYBH sediments with water depth. In the aerobic layer close to surface and withing the euphotic zone (3.1–38.6 m), Cyanobacteria capable of oxygen-producing photosynthesis had the highest relative abundance in the shallowest site SYBH1 where the DO concentration was the highest. As the redox regime changed from aerobic to anaerobic/sulfidic, the relative abundance of some taxa became higher, such as Bathyarchaeota, Lokiarchaeota, Firmicutes, Thermoplasmatales, Acidimicrobiales, Clostridiales and Desulfobacterales (Fig. ). These taxa may be associated with crucial biogeochemical processes and play key roles in maintaining the stability of ecosystems in anaerobic zones. Bathyarchaeota are a globally distributed archaeal phylum and important members of global biogeochemical cycles that are shown to highly abundant in anoxic sediments and are considered to utilize a wide range of labile and recalcitrant carbon sources. Firmicutes, a group of syntrophic bacterial taxa, can participate in biogeochemical cycles by degrading organic polymers and lignocellulosic plant material to H2, or converting small molecular compounds to H2 and acetate. Methanogenic archaea (phylum Euryarchaeota, order Methanosarcinales) were also identified from nine SYBH sites, and their relative abundance was higher in anaerobic zones with high levels of methane concentration (Table ). Our findings highlight differences in community composition between the aerobic and anaerobic zones of the SYBH and demonstrate that SYBH is a natural laboratory for understanding ecosystem function under oxygen deficiency across redox gradients.\nAs mentioned, the relative abundance of some prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa varied greatly between SYBH sites, such as Thaumarchaeota, DHVEG-6, Actinobacteria, Annelida, Arthropoda and Diatomea. Inferring from the results of our analysis, the distinct variations in relative abundance of these taxa between sites may be determined not only by environmental factors but also by strong biotic interactions. A growing number of studies emphasize that biotic interactions play an important role in influencing community diversity, driving key ecological processes, and governing species distributions at macroecological scales. Co-occurrence network analysis is a useful approach for exploring complex interactions within communities. The co-occurrence networks in this study indicated that the above-mentioned taxa had complex interaction networks (Fig. ). For example, Thaumarchaeota had negative interactions with Euryarchaeota and DHVEG-6, Annelida exhibited negative interactions with Chlorophyta, and Diatomea showed positive interactions with Chlorophyta. Members of Thaumarchaeota, Arthropoda and Annelida also showed a high proportion of intra-phylum interactions. Chen et al. suggested that abiotic factors played a minor role in shaping microeukaryotic plankton community in SYBH, and interspecies cooperation might be one of the ecological strategies. Here, co-occurrence networks suggest that biotic interactions (e.g., mutualism, commensalism, synergism) may play an important role in the distribution of these dominant taxa of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities in SYBH sediments. Furthermore, co-occurrence network analysis can provide new insights into keystone species in communities. In this study, the keystone OTUs in the archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic networks were mainly derived from Thaumarchaeota, Proteobacteria and unidentified Eukaryota, respectively, indicating that they potentially exerted a considerable impact on the community. At the OTU level, most correlations in bacterial and eukaryotic networks were positive (Fig. ), consistent with previous research, reflecting the widespread beneficial interspecific interactions such as mutualism, commensalism, and facilitation in the bacterial and eukaryotic communities. In the archaeal network, the number of positive correlations was close to the number of negative correlations (Fig. ), which indicated that negative interspecific interactions (e.g., competition) and the aforementioned positive interspecific interactions played roles in shaping community characteristics.\nThe mechanisms that shape microbial community structure have always been a key issue in understanding community dynamics in the SYBH. The results of He et al. suggested that temperature and nitrate concentration had significant contribution to the heterogeneous distribution of major bacterial clades and salinity explained most variations of the archaeal communities in SYBH water column. Similarly, Zhang et al. illustrated the significant correlations between the bacteria and environmental elements of DO, temperature, salinity, pH, sulfur and nutrient. However, the above research results are all focused on the microbial community in SYBH water. The RDA results in our study illustrated that sulfide, salinity, N2O, pH, DO and temperature had great impacts on the archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic communities, among which sulfide was the most prominent factor affecting the community structure in SYBH sediments (Fig. ). Finally, our beta diversity metrics may reflect spatial turnover and nestedness of assemblages, caused by species replacement and species loss, which are common traits that influence biodiversity. By applying Baselga's approach, our results show that the turnover component (βsim) is the main contributor to beta diversity (βsor) of the archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic communities in SYBH sediments (Table ). This indicates that the overall patterns of multiple-sites dissimilarity of the three domains in SYBH sediments are driven by species replacement rather than species loss, which may be the consequence of either environmental sorting or spatial and historical constraints. The Mantel test further revealed that the turnover component (βsim) of the three domains was influenced by a wide range of environmental variables, including sulfide, salinity, N2O, pH, DO and temperature (Fig. ). Compared with bacterial and eukaryotic communities, the βsim of archaeal community seems to be less affected by environmental variables. Quantifying the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes that shape microbial community assembly is considered a central challenge in ecology,, and also for SYBH. The NCM proposed by Sloan et al. is particularly useful in quantifying the importance of neutral processes and has been employed in bacterial community–, eukaryotic community and microeukaryotic community,. Although stochastic processes seem to influence planktonic microeukaryotes and deterministic processes dominate in prokaryotic plankton in the SYBH, our data from SYBH sediments indicate that stochastic processes appear to shape the sediment communities. Our results show that stochastic processes contributed to ~ 55% of the variations in archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic communities in SYBH sediments (Fig. ), indicating that stochastic processes might play more important roles than deterministic processes in the sedimental communities. Overall, the SYBH supports an interesting ecosystem that warrants further investigation in the future to decipher the metabolic capabilities of the identified taxa. This will facilitate our understanding of the biogeochemistry that exists in marine blue holes and how it is shaped by the in situ microbial communities.\nMaterials and methods\nSample collection\nSediment samples were collected from 12 sites at different water depths in the SYBH on board R/V CHANGHE OCEAN on May 17–28, 2017. Among the 12 sites, 10 sites were located in the oxygenated mixed layer with water depth ranging from 3.1 to 38.6 m, and the sediment samples from these 10 sites were recovered by scuba diving. The other two sediment samples were collected from the anaerobic layer at 150 and 300 m respectively with a ROV. All sediment samples were stored in liquid nitrogen on board until further processing. At each site, the hydrochemical properties were measured in the water column at the depth where sediment samples were collected. The supplementary information of the sediment samples can be found in Table  and Figure  of Li et al..\nDNA extraction, PCR amplification and illumina sequencing\nDNA was extracted from a 0.25 g sediment using the DNeasy PowerSoil kit (QIAGEN, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. One negative control without sediment was incorporated for each extraction session and three DNA replicates were extracted from each sample.\nThe V3-V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the primers 341F (5’-CCTAYGGGRBGCASCAG-3’) and 806R (5’-GGACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT-3’). The V4 region of 18S rRNA gene was amplified using the primers 528F (5’-GCGGTAATTCCAGCTCCAA-3’) and 706R (5’-AATCCRAGAATTTCACCTCT-3’) for eukaryote. The V4 region of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the primers Arch519F (5’- CAGCCGCCGCGGTAA-3’) and Arch915R (5’- GTGCTCCCCCGCCAATTCCT-3’). Forward and reverse primers were tagged with six nucleotide-long sequences appended at their 5’-end to multiplex the PCR products in a unique sequencing library. All PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 30 μL containing 15 μL of Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA), 0.2 μM of forward and reverse primers, and about 10 ng template DNA. Thermal cycling consisted of a pre-denaturation at 98 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. One PCR blank control without DNA was included during each amplification. Each PCR product was mixed with same volume of 1 × loading buffer, and electrophoresis was performed on 2% agarose gel for detection. The triplicated PCR products of one sample were mixed in equidensity ratios and the mixed PCR products were purified with Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany).\nSequencing libraries were generated using TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA) following manufacturer's recommendations. The library quality was assessed by the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific) and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform and 250 bp paired-end reads were generated at the Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing). The sequencing reads were submitted to the Sequence Read Archive under accession number PRJNA998750.\nSequence processing\nRaw paired-end reads were de-multiplexed to samples based on their unique barcode and truncated by cutting off the barcode and primer sequences. They were merged using FLASH, and the spliced sequences were called raw reads. Quality filtering on the raw reads were performed under specific filtering conditions according to the QIIME quality controlled process and low-quality sequences were filtered out. Chimera sequences were removed from reserved sequences using UCHIME algorithm. High-quality sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity level using UPARSE pipeline. The taxonomic assignment of bacterial OTUs and archaeal OTUs was performed using the Mothur method and the SILVA database (version 132), and the eukaryotic OTUs were taxonomically classified using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier and SILVA database (version 132). After taxonomic assignment, we excluded the OTUs that could not be assigned to the target community.\nDiversity and statistical analysis\nBefore calculating alpha and beta diversity, we normalized the data of each sample using a standard of reads number corresponding to the sample with the least reads using the R package vegan. The standard of reads number for archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes was 5340, 21,029 and 52,561, respectively. Alpha diversity estimated by Chao1 and Shannon index of the archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic communities were calculated on the normalized data with R packages vegan and picante. Community composition of archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes at the phylum and order levels were visualized in Fig.  with the R package ggplot2. The UPGMA analysis was performed based on the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index at the phylum level (Fig. ).\nPreliminary detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate whether RDA or CCA was more suitable for exploring the relationships between community and environmental variables. Preliminary DCA results revealed that the longest gradient length of the archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic communities was 2.69, 3.37, and 3.95 (> 3 standard deviations), respectively. Therefore, RDA was chosen for archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes to assess the relationships between community structure and environmental variables,. To improve normality and homoscedasticity, all environmental factors were log (x + 1) transformed before analysis. BIOENV and VPA analysis in R package vegan were used to identify the major environmental variables and evaluate their relative contribution in driving distribution patterns across the three domains (Fig. ).\nPartitioning of beta diversity\nThe beta-diversity as Sørensen index (βsor) of the archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic communities were partitioned into two components, turnover (βsim) and nestedness (βsne), by applying Baselga’s approach (Table ). The multiple-site measures of compositional dissimilarity across all sites and pairwise between-site dissimilarity matrices were computed from the presence-absence matrix using the function beta.multi and beta.pair of the R package “betapart”, respectively. The relationships between the environmental variables and the βsim and βsne were determine by Mantel test based on Pearson’s correlations (Fig. ).\nCommunity assembly process\nThe potential importance of stochastic processes to community assembly was evaluated using the Sloan’s NCM, which predicted the relationship between the occurrence frequency of OTUs and their relative abundance in the metacommunity. The model used here is an adaptation of the neutral theory adjusted to fit large microbial populations, and the analysis was performed using non-linear least-squares fitting with the R package minpack.lm. The parameters R2 and m represent the fit to the neutral model and the immigration rate, respectively (Fig. ). Calculation of 95% confidence intervals around all fitting statistics was done by bootstrapping with 1000 bootstrap replicates.\nCo-occurrence network construction\nCo-occurrence network analysis was conducted at the genus level and OTU level using R packages psych, igraph and Hmisc and visualized in Fig. . At the genus level, the bacterial genus and eukaryotic genus with a relative abundance of more than 0.5% and all archaeal genera were selected to generate the co-occurrence patterns (Fig. a–c). A Spearman’s coefficient of greater than 0.7 and a significance level of less than 0.05 indicated a significant correlation. The network diagram was generated by Gephi software. At the OTU level, only the OTUs with a relative abundance of more than 3% were selected to generate the co-occurrence patterns to show the interactions among OTUs (Fig. d–f). A Spearman’s coefficient of greater than 0.6 and a significance level of less than 0.05 indicated a significant correlation.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are highly grateful to the editor Dr. Yanhui Dong and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive and valuable comments that have substantially improved the manuscript.

    "text": "\nUnder cover of darkness, I boarded a Navy vessel at a heavily guarded military base along the Eastern Seaboard. The location and created_at of departure, as well as the direction and distance of travel, were unknown to me. Adding to the sense of secrecy, a towering sailor in camouflage stood in the rain, examining my belongings for electronics that might leave a digital trail an adversary could intercept and exploit.\nBuffeted by strong winds and high Atlantic seas, the support ship sailed through the night for more than 15 storm-tossed hours toward a destination somewhere off the continental shelf. Just after dawn, a sleek, inky object appeared in the distance, right above the waterline. It was the protruding bridge of what sailors call a \"boomer\"-a submarine armed to the gills with nuclear missiles-which is considered the most lethal, stealthy, and survivable weapon in America's strategic arsenal.\nPhotographer Philip Montgomery and I had been granted permission to chronicle life aboard a boomer-at a perilous created_at. Our embed was unique: The arms and technology on board, along with the ship's routines and missions, are among the government's most closely guarded secrets. We'd been told that the number of civilians who had been given this level of access (carrying cameras, no less) was roughly the same as that who have walked on the moon.\nLast summer, when I'd placed a request for the voyage, America was confronting two superpower threats: Beijing's increasingly bold advances in the South China Sea and Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Then, in October, the Israel-Hamas war added new urgency. US warships were drawn to the region, projecting force in case the conflict escalated. In short order, American vessels began intercepting long-range missiles that Iranian-supplied Yemeni rebels fired on Israel and on the ships themselves. When other Tehran-backed militias attacked US outposts in Iraq, Syria, and then Jordan, killing three service members in late January, it was apparent the reprisals from American fighter jets had not been a sufficient deterrent. President Biden, with carrier strike groups already in place, decided to retaliate forcefully, on multiple targets.\nIn October, we'd been slated to board a sub in, of all places, the Middle East. But when American vessels came under attack, our trip was scrubbed. \"You'd have been out at sea for months,\" one of our handlers worried. In November, though, we were given short notice to fly to a Southern city in the US where we would be met, escorted to a ship, and then ferried to a boomer. A senior officer, we were told, was heading out to conduct an evaluation of a rookie submarine captain, and we would be along to observe. The sub would surface for a short created_at-so as not to draw unwanted attention. We were to climb aboard and the ship would submerge.\nTo prepare, I had interviewed more than two dozen current officials responsible for US nuclear doctrine and warfare. And as I looked at the hulking slash on the horizon, the words of one naval captain resonated with me: \"When a single boomer goes out to sea, it does so as the sixth-largest nuclear nation on earth.\"\nNow, literally in the middle of nowhere, we made our rendezvous. A lashing rain seemed to be coming at us sideways. But suddenly, as we approached the sub, the sun broke through. Idling on our starboard like some leviathan loomed the missile deck of the USS Wyoming. A multibillion-dollar behemoth that is slightly longer than the Washington Monument is tall, the ship can carry up to 160 thermonuclear warheads, roughly the same firepower as India, a country that has been stockpiling nuclear arms for half a century.\nAs wars-hot and cold, visible and invisible-were being waged on land and at sea, it felt like an opportune created_at to meet the men, the women, and the weapons system that, in Pentagon terms, \"provide 24/7 deterrence to prevent catastrophic actions from our adversaries.\" The military's rationale for offering us access seemed clear. The brass, apparently, wanted to help get Americans accustomed to the increasingly real prospect of conflict with a genuinely powerful opponent. They wanted to humanize the otherwise inhuman-some would say inhumane-reality of nuclear deterrence. And, finally, they wanted to convey a message to China and Russia about US forces and their strategic capabilities, resolve, and, for the moment at least, superiority.\nSUB LORD\nAs the ominous backstop to America's national security, the Department of Defense relies on a triad: intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), long-range bombers, and submarines. The latter are considered the triad's least vulnerable leg and carry 70 percent of all deployed nuclear warheads in the inventory. Boomers are officially known as Ohio-class SSBNs-Navy-speak for \"submersible ship, ballistic, nuclear\"-and were built, as even the juniormost sailor will tell you (without a hint of irony), to \"preserve the peace\" and, in the event of strategic attack, to inflict unimaginable destruction. \"We are prepared to unleash hell,\" Admiral William Houston told me, adding that, of course, \"We never want to do it. Those sailors know if their weapon system is ever used, they are probably not coming home to their families. And so they take their business very, very seriously. It's what we refer to as a no-fail mission. You are working directly for the president when you're out there.\"\nStarting in 2021, Houston, 55, headed the US submarine force-25,000 strong, involved in the operation of 65 subs-and the Allied Submarine Command, which made him the principal undersea-warfare adviser to all of NATO's strategic commanders. Awarded his fourth star in December, he became director of the Navy and Energy Department's nuclear naval reactor program, a position once held by Admiral Hyman Rickover, a towering if controversial figure who is considered the father of the nuclear navy.\nWhile boomers may be the deadliest ships at sea, the sub command also operates Virginia-class hunter-killer subs (SSNs), which track and are prepared to sink enemy subs and surface ships, as well as guided-missile subs (SSGNs), among them the USS Florida, which in early November popped up in the Middle East. The Florida's very public passage through the Suez Canal, Houston insisted, was a \"message to remind people that you have an incredible warship right there that you can't do anything about. We're telling our adversaries: You have to be aware of its destructive capability if leadership decides to use it.\" This was no idle threat. In January, after myriad attacks by the Houthis-Iran's Yemen-based proxy army-against vessels flying a variety of flags, American officials, in a tandem strike with the UK, ordered the Florida to launch Tomahawk missiles at Houthi targets.\n\"My predecessors, some of them called themselves Underlord,\" Houston explained-a reference to mythic characters in the multiverse-\"and that has a dark connotation.\" The admiral added with a grin, \"I'm just waiting for sometext to give me some respect and call me Sub Lord. I'm a huge Marvel fan.\" His staff ribbingly slapped the moniker on his parking spot in front of his Norfolk, Virginia, headquarters.\nHouston's path to the Navy was unexpected. In high school in Buffalo, he and some buddies ditched lunch on a hot day to hang out in the college guidance office, the only spot with air-conditioning. They pretended to be flipping through ROTC applications when they were called on the carpet by an administrator who, as Houston recalled, told them that they could stay so long as they completed the paperwork. Houston wound up with an ROTC scholarship to Notre Dame and, during a monthlong voyage to Japan, fell in love with submarine culture. \"So, yeah, I'm in the Navy because I skipped lunch,\" he deadpanned. Later, when we returned to the subject, he observed, \"When people ask me why am I in the military, I go, 'Go to the Holocaust Museum in DC. There is evil in the world. There is pure, unadulterated evil.' \"\nTwo decades ago, as a deputy squadron commander, he helped integrate women into the all-male submarine service. The Wyoming, he noted, was an early target for the task since its namesake was the first state to allow women's suffrage. (The goal, moving forward, is for every ship to be gender-agnostic in its commands and roles.)\nNearly all Ohio-class subs are emblazoned with the name of a US state. The admiral spoke admiringly of the boat to which we'd been assigned. \"Wyoming is the most powerful warship ever created,\" he told me. \"It is the ultimate guarantor of our strategic deterrence.\" Hidden in its hull are 20 Trident II D5 ballistic missiles tipped with independently targetable warheads, each with many created_ats the destructive power of the bombs dropped on Japan in World War II. Tridents are so accurate, Houston said, they can hit a stadium on the other side of the globe. The central mission of the service's 14 boomers is to clandestinely plumb the world's oceans, waiting to respond if ever an enemy-for whatever reason, including a fit of pique or miscalculation-initiates a first strike. At that point, the president could decide to order the Wyoming, or one of its fellow subs, to launch in retaliation.\nFor further context, I dropped in on a Navy captain named Dan Packer. His assessment was even more blunt than Houston's. \"My job is to come up with ways to kill people and to find friends to help me kill people,\" he said when we first met. Until October, he was the director of plans and policy for the sub force-responsible for writing the playbook for undersea warfare-and has stayed on as a top civilian adviser. During his career, he served on four classes of submarine before returning to his alma mater, the Naval Academy, as dean of math and science. The man is a bit of a legend-a sailor and a scholar who literally grew up in the shadow of the atomic enterprise in a small South Carolina town just down the road from the Savannah River Site, where, since the 1950s, reactors have churned out plutonium and tritium for warheads.\nOn 9/11, Packer, then a lieutenant commander, was the engineer officer on the USS Ohio, an SSBN that was in the Pacific for a worldwide war game. Early that morning, the captain took to the PA to prepare the crew for the drill. Thirty minutes later, Packer said, the commander picked up the mic again to say, \"Cancel the exercise. The United States is under attack.\" Over the next few hours, the Ohio received fragmentary reports: The twin towers had been hit; the Pentagon had been struck (true) and destroyed (not true). They also understood that the president was airborne-another portentous sign to those who wait on orders from the National Command Authority, which the president directs. The Ohio, Packer recalled, began the march from DEFCON five. To four. To three. \"You take actions to make the platform more ready to complete its mission. You open safes and look at and access war plans that are normally not known or accessible.\" When I asked how unusual those actions were, he replied, \"I'd never seen those things. Ever.\" Sailors on the Ohio began to speculate about who was behind the attacks. \"The consensus on the boat was that it was Iran. And, as far as we were concerned, they were going to be radioactive glass,\" Packer remarked, painting an image of the hellscape that would result if the Tridents were launched. \"If you ever wonder if people would be ready to employ these weapons, the answer is yes.\" (When I mentioned to a senior national security official that I was meeting with the country's top nuclear strategists, his eyes went wide. \"Get ready for some straight talk,\" he advised. \"They never let these guys out of the cage. They aren't supposed to talk to anyone. So if you have them, expect to get an earful.\")\nPacker, like so many others interviewed for this story, told me he is bracing for a very different battle than the ones fought in the aftermath of 9/11. \"2027 is the year Xi Jinping said they need to be ready to go to war,\" he noted, referencing China's president. \"We use that as a benchmark.\" With that date only three years off, Packer is now the sub force's civilian lead on AUKUS, a trilateral security pact through which the US and UK are helping Australia field a fleet of nuclear subs in an attempt to check China's ambitions. He is also working on incorporating AI into aircraft that scour the South China Sea for acoustic signatures emanating from Beijing's subs.\nWhile public attention is focused on Ukraine and the Middle East, the Western submarine community is busy analyzing the threat posed by China's industrial base, which is churning out surface ships and undersea vessels at an astounding clip. The Chinese navy, in fact, is the world's largest, consisting of more than 370 vessels. American shipyards simply cannot keep pace.\nThe good news, Packer and others believe, is that for all its capacity, Chinese naval prowess, when it comes to submarines and seasoned sailors, is lacking. While that could change, it is unlikely to do so, many experts contend, on Xi's created_atline. That gives America's so-called Silent Service an advantage. \"In the Taiwan fight,\" Packer maintained, \"we're prepared to go into the jaws of the Chinese undersea forces and take them all out.\" All the surface ships as well.\nBLACK HULL, ORANGE TUBES\nOn the voyage out to the Wyoming, I was accompanied by Commander David Burke, 42, the deputy of Submarine Squadron 20, a seat Houston once occupied. Burke was coming out to conduct a spot inspection to make sure the crew and its new commanding officer (CO) were up to snuff.\nBurke would know. In February 2022, while in charge of an Atlantic fleet boomer, the USS Rhode Island, he received an urgent message that Russia was invading Ukraine. If the US made certain moves, Vladimir Putin soon warned, forces might be met with a nuclear response. \"That was a turning point,\" he recalled, \"a serious reminder of why our job is so important on an SSBN.\" Months later, when Burke surfaced the Rhode Island in Gibraltar, the meaning was clear: America's boomers can show up anywhere, any created_at. Last July, the USS Kentucky, a sister ship assigned to the Pacific, made a port call in Busan, South Korea, the first such visit in more than 40 years.\nAs massive as the trunks of redwoods, the missile tubes are ubiquitous; the bathrooms and crew quarters are situated right beside them.\nAs our support ship approached the Wyoming, Burke, a plainspoken Illinoisan with piercing blue eyes, was candid about the sacrifices submariners make by being out of touch for long stretches. \"I have an eight-year-old son and a four-year-old daughter. Through her fourth birthday I was probably gone 50 percent of her life-so it's tough,\" he conceded. \"If I'm going to be away from my family, I want it to be both professionally rewarding and challenging.\" He was less candid about his accomplishments. Only later did I learn that Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to head naval operations in the service's 248-year history, had just given him the coveted Stockdale Award, presented annually to the most inspiring leaders in the Navy. In short, the sub force command was sending a golden boy to put the Wyoming through its paces-with a Vanity Fair reporter and photographer in tow. The new CO was about to be tested in real created_at and on the record.\nAfter a night and a morning at sea, our embarkation had arrived. As whitecaps crashed against the Wyoming's hull, Burke went aboard first. I followed, traversing a rickety drawbridge from ship to ship, aided by a line of sailors fanned out across the sub's vast deck. Some were toting automatic weapons, a precaution when a boomer is on the surface. A rescue diver was ready if a swell took one of us overboard. The ship's slightly curved surface, like a giant whale's, was matte black, covered with special material that absorbs sound waves and masks the craft's sonar signature. The hull itself was punctuated with two rows of 12 round lids, like giant manhole covers. These ominous circles were the exit doors for the Trident missiles below.\nUpon reaching the hatch, I carefully descended several vertical ladders that were slick with sea spray. Stepping off, it felt like I was stepping back in created_at. I was surrounded by walls with exposed pipes, old-school circuitry, panels full of analog dials, switches, and gauges. It felt part boiler room, part brewery, part mad scientist lab from a 1950s sci-fi film. The explanation: When the devices on this class of sub were devised in the '70s and '80s, they were quite modern. Some have been upgraded; others remain unchanged (one uses a crank!) because they're reliable, durable, and easy to replace at sea. Here and there, I passed men and women in coveralls who were receiving instructions on throwback speakers and talking into vintage telephones. Save for the advanced systems in the control and sonar rooms (bristling with screens labeled \"secret\" and \"top secret\"), everything about the boat-down to the Wyoming's stated mission (to be \"on scene and unseen\")-harkened back to the Cold War. Maybe, I thought, we were being cast in the sequel. Or maybe the original never ended.\nMy first impressions were predictable: The ship seemed cramped, with narrow passageways. I was surprised, though, that the boomer's four decks, with 14-foot ceilings, also made it seem cavernous, even airy, in certain spots. Offsetting the retro-tech vibe were odd trinkets hanging from the walls: cowboy boots, lariats, spurs. This was, after all, the Wyoming, and as a way of paying homage to the state-and providing a touch of home-these voyagers had gone out of their way to set a Western tone to the decor. The ship's motto, I soon discovered, was \"Cowboy Up.\" And ever since the boat was commissioned in 1996, crew members have made pilgrimages to the state, meeting officials and supporters and taking in the rodeo.\nIn short order, we were cruising at dozens of miles an hour and depths of several hundred feet. And, unavoidably, the missiles remained front of mind. Every few steps I encountered what looked like curved walls, painted orange. These were the missile tubes, as massive as the trunks of redwoods. (An arms control pact with the Russians dictates that only 20 of the 24 missile tubes can be operable.) I also toured the torpedo room where the Mark 48s-with their 650-pound high-explosive warheads-are stored.\nThe missile tubes were ubiquitous-so much so that the bathrooms and crew quarters were situated right beside them. In fact, the compartment where I would spend the night-which contained six small, curtained-off bunks, as if on a train's sleeper car-was effectively wedged between two Tridents.\nCHESSMASTER\nThose orange tubes-those missiles-were the reason I was now hours from shore. But to understand their use, I wanted to meet the man who was in day-to-day control of them. And to that end, a month before my voyage, I paid a visit to landlocked Omaha.\nThere, I was invited into the buzzing corridors of the US Strategic Command (STRATCOM), the nerve center of America's nuclear arsenal, located at Offutt Air Force Base. This is the place that produced the Enola Gay and Bockscar, the B-29s that dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the place where President George W. Bush had taken temporary refuge on 9/11.\nWhen I arrived, I spotted mechanics attending to two aircraft on the tarmac. One was an E-6B Mercury, a nondescript plane that, if needed, can serve as both a communications relay for ballistic-missile subs like the Wyoming and as an airborne launch control for land-based ICBMs. Nearby was a heavily militarized version of a Boeing 747, the E-4B Nightwatch, which houses the National Airborne Operations Center, which, according to its mission statement, \"provides a highly survivable command, control and communications center&#230;in case of national emergency or destruction of ground command and control centers.\" Its nickname: the Doomsday Plane.\nSTRATCOM-with its 150,000 service members and civilians-is led by an Air Force four-star, General Anthony Cotton, who ushered me through his sprawling outer office, swarming with airmen, sailors, soldiers, and Marines, before taking me into his inner sanctum, a hushed, wood-paneled oasis in the eye of the storm. Cotton, along with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Charles Brown Jr., is part of a trio of Black leadership atop America's national-security pyramid. And it was a point of pride, clearly, that of all the Black four-stars, as Cotton told me, \"there's only been 10 in the history of the Air Force, and I'm number 10.\"\nI asked what drew him to the service. \"Simple,\" he said, walking over to a display case containing a folded flag with a picture next to it. \"That's my dad. He joined in 1942. As you can see, he was a diamond-wearing African American that was in World War II in the Army Air Corps, made the transition to the Air Force, and retired as a chief master sergeant in 1974. So I came out of the womb as a member of the military.\" He was emotional as he recalled how, in 2000, his father passed away a month to the day after his mother. \"He didn't see me make lieutenant colonel, but I buried with him my promotion recommendation form.\"\nI found Cotton, from Goldsboro, North Carolina, to be open, gregarious, and quick to laugh-traits that might seem at odds with the solemnity of his mission. \"I don't want to walk the halls of the Pentagon and when people see me, they're like, 'Oh, there's General Cotton, the nuclear guy,' \" he said.\nCotton, 60, recounted how he'd first felt the weight of command as a 22-year-old on his inaugural ride out to a missile field in Minot, North Dakota. \"You're jumping in that Suburban,\" he said, \"knowing that you're responsible to execute, under presidential authorities, the most powerful weapon on the face of the globe. You see the humming of the launch control center and you see 10 green lights and know that on the other side of that green light is a Minuteman III, with warheads on board. It all becomes real at that point.\" Cotton would eventually hold a string of lofty leadership posts, most recently running the Air Force Global Strike Command, responsible for the country's bombers and ICBMs.\nHis job as STRATCOM chief: preparing and, if necessary, turning to the tools at his disposal, from conventional long-range strike weapons and multiplatform nuclear arms to joint electromagnetic spectrum operations, which involve exploiting and attacking enemy frequencies (as well as protecting our own). Being able to provide those options to the commander in chief \"is what I do,\" he explained, before taking stock of the geopolitical moment. \"That's important, especially now as we see the threat vectors to rules-based international order.\" Translation: Over the second half of the last century, Western national security officials were preoccupied with trying to keep one adversary (the USSR) in check, even as the dueling nuclear powers ratified landmark arms control treaties. With those efforts now in eclipse and nuclear proliferation a chilling reality, America and its allies are currently contending with two near-peer opponents, Russia and China, as well as their own set of allies with nuclear aspirations, including North Korea, Iran, and, by extension, the Axis of Resistance-a term that encompasses armed groups like the Houthis in Yemen, Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, and the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq.\nThat's quite a roster. Who, I wondered, did Cotton have on speed dial? He chortled at the question before turning it back around, \"Who do you think?\" He then showed me a bank of phones with buttons for, among others, Biden, Austin, Brown, the leadership of the US intelligence community, and the 10 combatant commanders who, along with Cotton, command and deploy the nation's armed forces. \"Are you the guy notext wants to hear from?\" I asked, half in jest. \"Yeah, actually it does kind of suck,\" he said with a smile.\n\"When a single boomer goes out to sea\"-with up to 160 warheads-\"it does so as the sixth-largest nuclear nation on earth.\"\nShortly before my visit, the Florida had made its presence known in the Suez. Only hours after I departed, the B-21 Raider, which will replace the B-2 as a strategic bomber, made its first public flight. Cotton was eager to convey the range of options he can summon if required: missiles, bombers, subs. \"For me, being the chessmaster, [and] being able to offer those effects, if warranted, is incredibly important. Because at the end of the day, I'm supposed to be able to hold people at risk, and I can do that with the triad.\"\nStill, the chessmaster doesn't sleep soundly. \"Even at the height of the Cold War, you had conversations with your adversaries,\" Cotton said, alluding to the red phone, a hotline set up in 1963 between Washington and Moscow that allowed dialogue and de-escalation in created_ats of crisis. \"We're not seeing that with China. I would love to have my counterpart come visit me to understand what we're doing so there's no miscalculation.\" (In December, Brown spoke with a top Chinese general about reestablishing ad hoc communication, which Beijing had suspended after the US shot down a Chinese spy balloon.)\nSUB SPECIES\nIn the Wyoming's wardroom I met Jeremy Garcia, the sub's new CO. Like others who hold the rank of commander and helm a sub, he is addressed as \"captain\" on board. Burke was cordial to Garcia, but he was also there to give an unvarnished evaluation. So he hung back a bit.\nGarcia, 44, tall and bearing an uncanny resemblance to a young Tim Robbins, had not been given much notice about our visit or the decision to pair it with Burke's drop-by. But he seemed like the kind who rolled with the punches. He'd already had his trial by fire: His first week on active patrol at sea, Hamas and Israel had gone to war, and the Wyoming was prepped in case it might be tagged for duty there, if only to surface and convey a strategic message. Garcia was unflustered and welcoming. Off the bat, he urged me to speak with any of the 163 sailors on board-without any PR minders. I then accompanied him around his ship.\nA Bellevue, Washington, native, he'd enlisted in 1998 as a nuclear engineering and electronics technician. He made his bones on fast-attack and ballistic-missile subs before finally assuming the Wyoming's reins. The best part of the gig, he told me, is \"growing an amazingly talented and proficient team of warriors.\"\nTalented, indeed. The threshold for a billet on a boomer is, in part, one's range. Crew members must be comfortable spending months in a confined space (typically 70 to 100 days), pitching in on various assignments, and being knowledgeable about nuclear physics. Before submariners receive their insignia-a patch or pin showing a sub flanked by marine creatures-they must \"earn their fish\": demonstrating proficiency as first responders across departments, ever mindful of the threat posed by fire or a breach in the hull. Cooks, for example, can serve as EMTs if a sailor ever needs treatment by the onboard medic, who runs what amounts to an urgent care clinic. The wardroom can be converted into an operating theater. (With elaborate systems for swapping in crews and rations, subs, unless they require maintenance, can conceivably remain at sea, indefinitely, during created_ats of heightened tension.)\nWalking the ship, I met mariners who were Asian, Black, Latino, immigrants, first-generation Americans, third-generation sailors, and so on. This was a point of pride for the captain and the sub force. And yet the culture has become so ingrained that merely inquiring about it-or the 13-year effort to integrate women on subs-was met with eye rolls. A distinct message was coming through to me: The perils and impediments of life underwater trivialized any fissures that might otherwise exist on land. \"A submarine is always trying to kill you and our job is trying not to die,\" asserted Jonathan Omillian, a salty missile technician, who noted that crew members were united in purpose. \"The reason that we are out here is so that we have a place to come home to. We are pretty much the big guys standing up to the bullies saying, 'Hey'-excuse my language-'Fuck off. Don't fuck with us. We are bigger. We are better.' \"\nHis ship's leader has a command philosophy that might seem counterintuitive to those on shore. \"I'm a big fan of pushing responsibility down to the lowest level,\" Garcia said, \"and the lowest level does not mean rank. It means technical expertise and experience. So if that means a very important program can be run by a first-tour individual of any rank, then I'm fine with that-as long as they own it.\"\nThe job of diving and steering, for example, is not in the captain's remit. He has put that chore in the hands of the juniormost people (albeit with a senior officer seated behind them). Garcia, like a dozen other COs I spoke to, takes people who are too young to legally drink, metaphorically drops them in the deep end, and says, \"Swim.\" True, other branches of the military imbue airmen, soldiers, and Marines with outsize responsibility. But I am hard-pressed to think of another mission as daunting as testing a teenager's mettle underwater with a nuclear reactor in back and thermonuclear warheads in front.\nBeyond their duties, the Gen Z'ers-and the millennials who supervise them-must contend with a life that is practically monastic. They are completely removed from meaningful connectivity, including social media. Their only contact with the outside world involves infrequent (and heavily monitored) emails with family when the sub is at a depth and a posture that permit it. There is also little privacy beyond the confines of a draped bunk that can feel like a coffin. Deprived of many other creature comforts, sailors can avail themselves of exercise gear, which is spread around the boat, including treadmills and free weights-but not when the sub is running silent so as to evade detection.\nWhen I first entered the command-and-control room, called \"the conn,\" a young ensign named Kirsten Barber was moving with purpose between banks of displays and the sub's twin periscopes. She was standing watch, scanning for vessels-on the surface or submerged-that might approach the sub or compromise its position. \"Knowing that we're out here basically keeping the entire United States safe,\" she told me, \"is pretty awesome, actually.\" Barber answers to the nickname Chop, a title submariners assign the chief supply officer, a job vital to the ship's operation and the crew's morale.\n\"Some of the smartest people I've met are younger than me,\" Barber said, gesturing toward the stern. \"I'm 23 and there are some people back aft running a nuclear reactor that just blow me away every day. They have to be smart to be on this boat.\" I was reminded of a conversation I had when I first visited sub force command. Over lunch, a young Annapolis grad-an astrophysicist who evidently has a couple of satellites named after her-discussed her plans to possibly switch gears and become an astronaut. She was reciting, rather than bragging about, her created_at at school and at sea, when a captain sitting next to her piped in wryly, \"I have the same credentials. Other than the satellites.\"\nAt one point on the trip, I found myself marveling over, of all things, a biscuit. Not only was it gluten-free, it was delicious. When I shared my surprise with Barber, she beamed. Of all her roles, none looms larger than overseeing the galley. She took me on a tour of the cavernous refrigeration and freezer compartments that are manned by \"Jack of the Dust,\" the sobriquet of the sailor-bedecked in winterized gear-in charge of provisions storage.\nVirtually everyone I interviewed on the Wyoming raved about the food, which is an atypical reaction when it comes to military chow. There is a reason for that: Among the ship's secret weapons is Culinary Specialist Chief Petty Officer Earl White. Raised in Granville, Ohio, White followed in his grandfather's steps, starting his career as a butcher before going to culinary school. In 2009, he joined the Navy and served for six years on Burke's old boat, the Rhode Island, before taking a land-based assignment. \"I did four years at Camp David,\" he recounted while kneading dough in the galley. (The Navy also runs the White House dining room, famously referred to as The Mess.) \"I did two years of Obama, two years of Trump. It was an incredible experience.\" White not only served first families and VIPs, he also earned prestigious gourmet certifications. While we were underway, he whipped up bisques and beignets.\nFor one lunch, we had a Mexican spread; even at sea they called it Taco Tuesday. I shared meals in the wardroom with Burke, Garcia, his deputy Ben Reed, and several junior officers. We dined on oxtail, salmon, and winter vegetables-served on proper Navy china. (After supper, Burke and Garcia teamed up in a fierce, smack-talking game of cribbage against other Navy visitors.)\nBut the main event, as all of us knew, was how Garcia would be judged by his cribbage comrade, Burke. Top officials can issue all the orders they want, but someone has to push the buttons, quite literally. And so the climactic moment aboard the Wyoming came when Garcia and company engaged in a command-and-control exercise (CCX), replicating the exact, and exacting, procedures required to deploy the sub's deadly payload.\nFor much of the voyage, I'd noticed that Burke, silent but affable, would appear and then drift away to assess crew members on their navigation skills, their weapons preparedness, and their engineering prowess. Now, with Burke watching from the wings, the CCX commenced.\nAs planned, a simulated emergency action message (EAM) came in from the National Command Authority. The message was received by the communications team, led by 27-year-old Lieutenant Michael Gomez, whom everyone calls Commo. He was quickly joined by another junior officer and, using their thumbs and forefingers, they jointly grasped the EAM-a plastic object about the size of a playing card-and the men, facing each other, walked sideways across the conn. The reason for this unusual choreography: The nuclear command-and-control process requires two-person integrity, theoretically ensuring that there be redundant affirmation should a worst-case EAM ever be received-until the unimaginable moment a missile might be released.\nWhen the pair reached the spot where Garcia was standing, they could see that resting on his hip were scores of keys that were wrapped around his frame like a tangle of Christmas lights. \"The CO has lanyards that contain keys needed to carry out very specific processes to support any missile launch,\" a senior Navy officer explained. \"These keys are part of a nuclear safeguard process and are used in various locations around the SSBN to enable a launch when, and only when, a launch order has been validated to be from the US president-as he or she is the only person that can authorize a launch from an SSBN.\"\nWith his executive officer standing beside him, the captain authenticated the message, checking it against a codebook to ensure that neither an outside party nor an onboard subversive had intercepted and changed it in any way. Garcia then uttered a phrase that, were it not a drill, might irrevocably lead to the alteration of some portion of the planet: \"I concur with missilization.\"\nOver in the sub's Missile Control Center, the weapons officer, Lieutenant William Zupke and his deputy, Lieutenant Junior Grade Noelle Gill, were hunched behind sailors who peered at consoles displaying the status of every missile tube. Armed guards milled about. \"Standing by for fire order,\" someone said. Over the loudspeaker came the reply, \"Concur with fire order.\"\nThe ritual-the call-and-response, the presiding officiant, the two curates holding what amounted to a death wafer-had all the hallmarks and mystery of ceremonies performed in houses of worship or secret societies. In a way, the CCX had the trappings of a sacred rite turned on its head: a military liturgy that reinforced the profound implications of a potentially apocalyptic process.\nNothing was fired, of course. The keys inserted were effectively blanks. The entire exercise took only a matter of minutes. But the point was made: Not one of the submariners even flinched. All behaved as if, given the order, they would have had sufficient nerve to perform the task required.\nA couple of weeks later, I asked Burke for his assessment of Garcia and his team. His response sounded like something Rickover might have said following the maiden 1960 voyage of the very first boomer, the USS George Washington. Burke felt the captain and his sailors performed well, \"demonstrated tenacity,\" and fulfilled \"their mission of strategic deterrence and readiness to execute the president's orders should deterrence fail.\"\nBEFORE DAWN\nAt 5 A.M. on the day of our departure, I climbed up to the bridge-the highest position on the ship-to join Gomez, who stood watch in the hours before dawn. \"Every created_at we're on the surface, I come up here,\" he said. His father is in US Special Forces; his wife serves on a surface ship. Two flights down, in the conn, Lieutenant Jeanny Sanger, a fellow Annapolis grad (and Ultimate Frisbee club teammate), was on duty.\nSuddenly, a loud voice squawked from a speaker. The Wyoming's suite of sophisticated sensors had spotted something. \"He's about 25 miles away,\" Gomez said with binoculars at the ready. A surface ship? I inquired. \"Yeah, hopefully, it's not a submarine,\" he responded.\nAfter we sailed on for a few minutes, he broke the silence and spoke about his peers on the Navy's other subs: \"The fast-attacks get out and they get to do all the cool stuff every day. We don't really get to do any of that. But it kind of does feel like you're doing your mission when we're out here and things are getting hot in the world.\"\n"

    "title": "Experimental study on the effects of water content on the compression characteristics and particle breakage of calcareous sand",
    "created_at": "2024-03-15",
    "text": "\nIntroduction\nCalcareous rock and soil is a unique type of rock and soil material formed after the death of marine calcareous organisms, such as reef-building coral communities (e.g., corals, seaweeds, shellfish), and under the long-term effect of geologic (e.g., proximal transport deposition, etc.) and physicochemical factors (e.g., breakage of debris, calcification, etc.). It is more commonly found close to the continental shelves of tropical or sub-tropical climates and along coastlines (generally between 30° N and 30° S). Particle breakage of calcareous sand under a constant stress is a distinctive characteristic of new geotechnical media,. Macroscopically, particle breakage directly leads to a change in the particle gradation (composition), which causes a decrease in the void ratio and an increase in the relative density of calcareous sand, and has non-negligible effects on its strength (internal friction angle), dilatancy, critical state, compression deformation properties, and permeability coefficient, resulting in a variation in the constitutive relationship of calcareous sand. Microscopically, the shear strength of calcareous sand is mainly related to the magnitude of the friction between the particles and the contact relationship between the particles. Particle breakage leads to a change in the particle shape, causing a variation in the particle friction coefficients as well as rearrangement of particle positions, which affects the contact relationships between particles and also the microstructure. \nHence, particle breakage is a key factor in studying the mechanical properties of calcareous sand.\nExperimental and quantitative analyses have shown that many factors affect the particle breakage of calcareous sand–. For example, Coop and Sorensen conducted ring shear tests on calcareous sand and found that particle breakage continues to occur under large strains, and the final particle size distribution was related to the initial gradation and confining pressure. Miao and Airey analyzed the effects of the variations in the void ratio, gradation property, and particle shape on the particle breakage of calcareous sand through large-strain ring shear tests and high-pressure consolidation tests. Xiao et al. conducted confined compression tests on calcareous sand at vertical pressures in the range 0.1–3.2 MPa and found that particle breakage as well as volumetric deformation of calcareous sand are directly proportional to the input work and that the relationship between particle breakage and the input work is independent of the initial density. Liu et al. conducted a series of confined compression tests and triaxial tests under different test conditions on two types of calcareous sand specimens collected from the South China Sea. The results showed that a significant amount of particle breakage occurs in calcareous sand under different loading modes, significantly affecting its mechanical properties. Moreover, an increase in the confining pressure led to an increase in the particle breakage. Through stress path tests on limestone rockfill material, Xu et al., found that the stress level and loading path are key factors affecting the stress–strain relationship of soil. A DEM simulation revealed that the confining pressure, deviatoric stress, and loading direction significantly influence the evolution of the breakage created_at and breakage mode of aggregates during shearing. Liu, Wu, Hassanlourad, Brandes, and Shahnazari proposed factors affecting the particle breakage of calcareous sand through experiments or directly introduced the influencing factors into the constitutive relationships of calcareous sand,.\nHowever, most of these studies have been based on the effects of various factors on the particle breakage of calcareous sand in the saturated state. Theoretically, the water content is another key factor affecting the compression characteristics and particle breakage of calcareous sand. The compression properties of calcareous sand are similar to those of normally consolidated cohesive soils,, the internal pores of which reflect the water content capacity of sand specimens. The three-phase proportionality relationship directly affects the physical state and indirectly reflects the engineering properties of calcareous sand. Therefore, the water content and compression properties of calcareous sand have some theoretical relationship with particle breakage. Moreover, water plays a lubricating role in the relative movement between particles, and different water contents can cause different degrees of particle breakage in granular soil. Many researchers have confirmed that particle breakage increases with the increase in the water content. For example, Marsal and Chavez et al. experimentally demonstrated that granular soil with a high water content is more susceptible to breakage. Oldecop and Alonso explained that this phenomenon is due to the corrosive effect of water on the particles, which causes internal softening of the particles and makes a wet specimen to be more fragile than a dry specimen. Nieto-Gamboa showed that the effective capillary tensile stress in the internal cracks of particles increases because of the increase in the water content, exacerbating crack expansion and particle breakage. Xiao et al. conducted direct box shear tests on silica sand with different dry densities and water contents to investigate the effects of dry density and water content on the shear strength of silica sand. The stress required to achieve the same strain in the standard sand specimen was found to increase with the increase in the dry density of the standard sand and the normal stress of the test, whereas it decreased with the increase in the water content of the standard sand. Li et al. reached similar conclusions through tests. Liu et al. experimentally found a correlation between the water content and thermal conductivity of calcareous sand. However, the effects of water content on the compression characteristics and particle breakage of calcareous sands are yet to be explored.\nConsidering that the water content of calcareous sand is closely related to the particle breakage and compression characteristics and taking calcareous sand from the sea near a reef in the Nansha Islands of China as the test material, 50 sets of confined compression tests were conducted in this study under different gradations, water contents, and vertical pressures (tests in which the specimens were laterally restricted so that no lateral deformation could occur, and compression deformation was produced only in the vertical direction). The compaction characteristics and particle breakage law of calcareous sand with different water contents under different vertical loads were investigated. The novelty of this study was to analyze the relationship between the water content and particle breakage and compression characteristics. The findings can provide the necessary theoretical basis and reference for engineering practice in the construction of islands and reefs as well as in integrated ocean management.\nMaterials and test methods\nTest instrument\nThe test apparatus was a WG-type high-pressure consolidation apparatus produced by Nanjing Instrument and Equipment Factory. The cutting ring of the device specimen was a steel mold with a diameter of 6.18 cm and a height of 2 cm. The vertical loading in the test was implemented using weights with a maximum vertical stress of 4000 kPa. The vertical deformation was measured using a dial indicator with a range of 10 mm, placed on a loading bar, as illustrated in Fig. a. Figure b shows the section of the test apparatus.\nWG-type high-pressure consolidation apparatus.\nTest material\nCalcareous sand from the sea near Yongshu Reef, Nansha Islands was used as the test material. The calcareous sand was qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. Table  presents the test results. The key constituent of the test material was calcium carbonate. As revealed by an X-ray fluorescence spectrometry analysis, calcium carbonate accounts for 96.39% of the total content. The specific gravity of the particles was 2.75. The sand specimens were washed with water and air-dried for use. Previous studies have revealed that the particle breakage of calcareous sand with a single particle size is greater than that of calcareous sand with a continuous gradation, and that the particle shape affects the particle breakage and compression characteristics of calcareous sand. To increase the particle breakage effects and eliminate the effects of particle shape, two particle sizes in the ranges of 1–0.5 mm (Specimen B) and 0.5–0.25 mm (Specimen S) were selected through a sieving test. Figures  and  show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the two calcareous sand specimens with two different particle sizes. The fine morphology of the sand specimens revealed that the sand specimen particles have an uneven surface, many fissure defects, evident angles, low roundness, high angularity, and rich internal pores.\nContents of each component in calcareous sand (%).\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Specimen B at different magnifications.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Specimen S at different magnifications.\nTest method\nTo investigate the particle breakage under different water contents and stresses, five specimens were preset with different water contents in the test: air-dried sand specimens (0.6%, 5%, 10%, and 15%) and saturated sand specimens (42%). The preset initial void ratio was 1.2. Except for the saturated specimens, which were prepared from air-dried sand specimens according to the preset void ratios using pumping saturation, the preset water content was taken for the rest of the sand specimens. The required sand specimens were weighed based on the preset void ratio and the volume of the cutting ring, and the specimens were placed into the cutting ring using the air pluviation method.\nThe loading pressures for test termination were 1200, 1600, 2400, 3200, and 4000 kPa, and the unloaded rebound test was performed at 4000 kPa. The test was strain-controlled. The stabilization criterion for each loading level was that the variation in the dial gauge reading should not exceed 0.01 mm per hour, and the next level of loading was applied until the predetermined level of the termination pressure was reached. After the test, the specimens were carefully removed, dried and weighed, and finally sieved. Considering the low strength of calcareous sand particles and the possibility of particle breakage during sieving, which can affect the test results, the sieving created_at was set to 15 min. Table  presents the specific schemes of the tests.\nTest schemes.\n1The water content of the saturated specimen is approximately 42%\n2The water content of the air-dried sand specimen is 0.6%\nFor each tested specimen, the particle size distribution curves after the test were obtained using the sieve analysis method. According to previous studies,, the relative breakage index Br reported by Hardin was selected as the breakage index in this study. The specific steps are as follows: the areas enclosed by the particle size distribution curves before and after the test and the 0.075 mm particle size cut-off line were calculated. The particle breakage index was the ratio of the difference between the two areas and the area enclosed by the particle size distribution curve before the test and the 0.075 mm particle size cut-off line.\nResults and analysis\nParticle breakage under different water contents\nFigure  shows the particle size distribution curves before and after the test under different water contents at 4 and 1.2 MPa (for the convenience of drawing in the figure, the original particle size distribution curve is plotted as 0.1% when the content is zero). The calcareous sand specimen exhibited evident particle breakage under pressure. The greater the pressure, the more evident the breakage phenomenon. Each specimen was crushed under pressure, and although the fine particles increased in large quantities, the initial particle size of both specimens S and B was retained in large quantities. This is consistent with the breakage phenomenon of quartz sand particles reported by Zhang et al.. This can be explained by the fact that during the consolidation process, the resistance of larger particles is enhanced due to the buffering of the surrounding small particles.\nGradation curves under different vertical pressures.\nAs shown in Fig. , the particles have different degrees of growth for different water contents under a vertical pressure. Taking Specimen B as an example, a detailed analysis of its particle breakage revealed that all the particle size groups except for those with a particle size range of 1–0.5 mm showed different degrees of growth compared with the original gradation. This indicated that a certain particle breakage occurred in the particle size range of 1–0.5 mm under loading. The variation in each curve was not significant: the growth of particles in the size range of 1–0.5 mm decreased, whereas the growth of particles in other size ranges increased, and there was no evident growth of particles with sizes below 0.5 mm. Clearly, although particle breakage occurred in the compression process of Specimen B, the growth of particle breakage was not evident, and the particle breakage was dominated by particles in the size range of 1–0.5 mm. Even under maximum loading, particles in the size range of 1–0.5 mm decreased considerably but did not completely disappear. The content of particles in the size range of 0.5–0.25 mm decreased compared with the upper-level loading test, indicating that some of the particles in the size range of 0.5–0.25 mm were broken into particles smaller than 0.25 mm during the compression process. A comparison of Specimens B and S without considering the effects of the differences in the gradation parameters and under the same termination vertical pressure showed that due to the closer contact between particles with a lower average particle size (Specimen S), the surface of the coral sand particles (Specimen B) relative to that of the coarse particles did not have any evident defects and had more internal pores. Moreover, coral sand with a relatively small average particle size (Specimen S) produced less particle breakage under external force. The coarse particle group (Specimen B) could be characterized by irregularly shaped particles, such as branches and coral fragments, and the particles were often sharp-edged. The particles were larger, the effective contact points of the particles were fewer, and these edges were prone to produce stress concentration that led to brittle particles, which resulted in a higher breakage index for coral sand with a larger average particle size (Specimen B). A small amount of water infiltrated the soil particles, resulting in a capillary suction between the particles due to surface tension. This effect hindered the normal movement between the particles and increased the inter-particle sliding resistance, resulting in a higher breakage of wet sand particles than dry sand particles in the compression process.\nFigure  shows the curves of the particle breakage index versus the vertical pressure under different water contents. The particle breakage index increased with the increase in the confining pressure. The relationship between the particle breakage index and confining pressure presented the following functional relationship.\nVertical pressure versus the relative breakage index.\nHere, σ denotes the vertical stress, and Br denotes the relative breakage index. Kb and na denote the fitting parameters.\nIt is easy to understand the relationship between the aforementioned relative breakage index and vertical stress. When the vertical stress was equal to zero, the relative breakage index was zero. When the vertical pressure tended to infinity, the particles were all crushed to a size less than 0.074 mm, at which point the relative breakage index reached a limiting value of 100%. The values of Kb and na at each water content could be obtained by fitting, as listed in Table . The relative breakage index of calcareous sand under different water contents and vertical stresses could be calculated using Eq. () and the fitting curve (as shown in Fig. ). As shown in Table , different water contents had different effects on the two fitting parameters, and the fitted parameter Kb was evidently more sensitive to the variation in the water content than na.\nComparison of fitting parameters.\nHardin proposed a similar relational equation in 1985 as follows:\nHere, σb denotes the effective stress of breakage, and σr denotes the baseline breakage stress, which reflects the ability of the particles to resist breakage. h denotes the Mohr strength of the particles, and nb denotes the particle breakage index. pa denotes the standard atmospheric pressure, ei denotes the initial void ratio, and ns denotes the particle shape coefficient.\nComparing Eqs. () and (), it can be found that the fitting parameter Kb can reflect the ability of the particles to resist breakage, which is correlated with the Mohr strength h of the particles. This indicated that the effects of the variation in the water content on the particle breakage of calcareous sand were mainly reflected in the softening effect of water on the specimen particles. This reduced the Mohr strength of the particles, which was macroscopically reflected in the relative breakage index of the particles. As listed in Table , this softening effect is not completely positively correlated with the water content.\nThe fitting parameter na under the same particle size did not vary significantly, whereas the fitting parameter na under different particle sizes had a large variability, indicating that the effects of the variation in the gradation on the relative breakage index can be expressed by na.\nCompression characteristics of sand specimens with different water contents\nFigure  shows the loading–unloading compression curves of Specimens B and S at various water contents. The compression curves exhibited an upward convex shape under all pressure levels, and there was a significant consolidation yield pressure. However, the significant variability in the compression curves under different water contents indicated that the compression characteristics of the calcareous sand were sensitive to the water content. With the increase in the water content, the final compression deformation of the calcareous sand gradually increased. However, when the water content reached a certain value, the final compression deformation decreased. For Specimen B, this occurred at a water content of 10%, and for Specimen S, this occurred 15%, which may have been due to the unique internal pores in the calcareous sand (e.g. Fig. ).\nLoading–unloading compression curves of calcareous sand.\nDuring the test, although the water content gradually increased, the surface of the calcareous sand did not contain much water (except in the saturated specimens), and the water was essentially stored within the internal pores of the calcareous sand. With the increase in the pressure, the particles moved, crushed, rearranged, and accordingly accumulated, and the water in the internal pores was squeezed and released. The capillary water pressure and surface tension of the water intensified the agglomeration of particles between the pores, and the final compression deformation increased. However, with the increase in the water content of calcareous sand, the compression of the sand specimen gradually changed from the two-phase medium of the original sand specimen and air to a three-phase medium comprising sand specimen, air, and water. The force between the particles decreased, and the compression deformation of the calcareous sand specimen decreased. When the particles were smaller, the contact area between the particles increased, the force between the particles weakened, the water in the internal pores could not be easily released, and the compression peak water content increased. Therefore, Specimen S had a higher water content than Specimen B.\nAs shown in Fig. , the calcareous sand specimen exhibited a very small rebound when unloading. This indicated that the compression deformation of the calcareous sand was mainly dominated by plastic deformation. The same experimental phenomenon has been reported in many studies,. To further study the compression–unloading characteristics, the compression–unloading curves under different water contents were obtained using the loading curve slope λ and unloading curve slope К of the normal consolidation line (NCL), similar to that in classical soil mechanics; Fig.  shows the results. With the increase in the water content, λ increased first and then decreased. When the water content was 10%, λ exhibited a high value, which was close to twice than that of dry sand. However, К had a considerably low variation. Therefore, the compression properties were closely related to the initial water content of the specimen. Since the compression deformation of the calcareous sand was dominated by plastic deformation, it had a considerably low effect on the resilience curve.\nWater content versus the slope of the loading–unloading curve of calcareous sand.\nUnder the same water content, the variations in λ and К of the specimens with different particle sizes were small or the same. This indicated that the posterior section of the compression curve and the unloading curve of the calcareous sand were approximately parallel to each other under the same water content. A similar phenomenon has been reported by Ghafghazi through tests. Meanwhile, this also indicated that the initial gradation had a considerably low effect on the compression and unloading characteristics of the specimen in the later stage of loading. This may be explained by the fact that with the increase in the pressure, the particle breakage of the sand specimens became increasingly serious, changing the particle gradation, and the initial gradation had an increasingly less effect on the calcareous sand.\nTo thoroughly understand the effects of different water contents on the compression deformation under various levels of pressure p, the variations in the void ratio (− de/dp) under various levels of pressure increments were plotted, as shown in Fig. . The effects of the water content on the compression coefficient of calcareous sand mainly occurred at low pressures and gradually reduced with increasing pressure. This may be explained by the fact that with the increase in the pressure, the void ratio gradually decreased, and after the density of the calcareous sand specimen increased to a certain level, particle movement and breakage became increasingly difficult, thus decelerating the compression deformation and reducing the differences in the variation in the void ratios.\n(− de/dp)—p curves.\nNotably, the single-particle-size calcareous sand specimen selected in this study was only to increase the particle breakage of the specimen; it does not mean that this type of soil can be used in practical engineering. In practical engineering, the use of calcareous sand foundation is often a last resort. Because the special geographical environment is far away from the mainland and site condition constraints, in the construction of islands and reefs, a construction scheme involving local materials can only be adopted, using calcareous sand from a lagoon as the filling material and fencing the coral reef pads to serve as the foundations of buildings and structures. Therefore, sand with a single-particle-size gradation will not be specially selected for engineering construction. Meanwhile, this study mainly investigated the effects of water content on the particle breakage and compression characteristics of calcareous sand. The microscopic characteristics of the specimen, percolation characteristics, and pore pressure dissipation in the compression consolidation process are yet to be explored.\nConclusions\nIn this study, confined compression tests were conducted on calcareous sand under different particle gradations and water contents. The compaction characteristics and the relationship between particle breakage and water content of the sand specimen were investigated. The main conclusions of this study are as follows:\nWith the increase in the water content, the final compression deformation of the calcareous sand gradually increased. However, when the water content reached a certain value, the final compression deformation decreased. The magnitude of this water content value was related to the initial gradation of the calcareous sand.\nThe compression deformation of calcareous sand was mainly dominated by plastic deformation. Under the same water content, the initial gradation had no effects on the compression and unloading characteristics of the specimen in the later stage of loading. The effects of water content on the compression coefficient of calcareous sand mainly occurred when the pressure was low, and with the increase in the pressure, this effect gradually weakened.\nUnder different water contents, the relative breakage index of the particles increased with increasing in confining pressure, and the empirical formula for calculating the breakage particle was obtained by fitting. The effects of the variation in the water content on the particle breakage of the calcareous sand were mainly reflected in the softening effect of water on the specimen particles, which reduced the Mohr strength of the particles, and this macroscopically reflected in the relative breakage index of the particles.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42172295), the Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Department Natural Science Foundation Youth Project (2023AFB339), the Hubei Provincial Education Department Science and Technology Research Program Young Talent Project (Q20222701), and the Natural Science Foundation of Xiaogan (XGKJ2022010101).

The area has been the site of multiple encounters between Philippine and Chinese vessels in the past year.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hailed the Philippines as a\"strategic partner\" and signed multiple deals with Marcos Jr aimed at cementing\"enhanced maricreated_at cooperation\" while vowing to\"collaborate even more closely to promote our shared vision for the region.\"\nIn response, a state-backed Chinese newspaper slammed Marcos Jr's address as a cynical ploy\"to drag [an] ally into provocative strategy\", arguing that the Philippines is rallying Western powers to keep China's ambitions in the South China Sea in check.\nIn many ways, Australia hopes that Marcos Jr's address sets the tone for the upcoming summit with Southeast Asian leaders. But while Philippine-Australia bilateral relations seem to be on an upward trajectory, if not entering a new\"golden era\", it's unlikely that other ASEAN leaders will follow through.\nIf anything, the Philippines may, once again, end up as a regional outlier. Eight years earlier, the pro-Beijing Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was the only no-show ASEAN leader at the inaugural Australia-ASEAN Summit.\nThis created_at, the incumbent Philippine president is likely the only Southeast Asian leader fully invested in a full-blown security partnership with Australia with an eye on China.\nClosest of friends\"Australia remains, and will continue to be, one of our closest friends...we shall forge ahead in fully maximizing the potentials and the gains from this Strategic Partnership between our two forward-looking, law-abiding maricreated_at states,\" Marcos said upon his arrival in Australia last week.\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr together with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the signing of a Joint Declaration on Strategic Partnership between Philippines and Australia at Malacañang Palace, September 8, 2023.

The state visit was no trivial matter. The two nations are not only fellow US treaty allies but also among the oldest liberal democracies in the Asia-Pacific region. The two sides fought side-by-side against Imperial Japan, most notably during the\nBattle of Surigao Strait (1944) , where Australian forces were essential to US General Douglas MacArthur's recapture of the Philippines from Tokyo.\nFor many reasons, however, Philippine-Australia relations were largely static throughout the second half of the 20th century, with both sides acting as de facto\"deputy sheriffs\" to America in their respective subregions but without much bilateral economic or strategic interaction.\nOver the past decade , however, bilateral relations have taken on greater urgency as the Philippines began implementing its Status of Visiting Forces Agreement (SOVFA) with Australia on the heels of the Scarborough Shoal crisis in 2012, where China seized control of the South China Sea feature after a monthslong standoff.\nAustralia soon became a vital defense partner for the Philippines by, inter alia, conducting regular drills with and donating defense equipment to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). Ties took a dramatic turn under Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who twice visited the Philippines in the mid-2010s in order to cement a Comprehensive Partnership pact.\nThe value of the burgeoning alliance was on full display during the Battle of Marawi (2017), when Canberra provided real-created_at intelligence and training to facilitate the AFP's counterterrorism operations against so-called Islamic State-affiliated militant groups in the southern Philippines.\nThe problem, however, was that then-Philippine president Duterte largely shunned tighter security cooperation with Western powers, even if he personally thanked Canberra for its counterterrorism assistance at Malawi. Over the past two years, however, there has been a perfect convergence in the strategic orientation of the two sides.\nFresh into power, the Albanese administration, staffed with several Bahasa-speaking cabinet members, made it clear that Southeast Asia would be a top strategic priority. Accordingly,\nDeputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles and Australia's Malaysian-born Foreign Minister Penny Won made successive visits to key ASEAN states to signal Australia's commitment to the region.\nBut it was Manila that proved a special case, thanks to Marcos Jr's dramatic pivot towards traditional Western allies following months of unrequited diplomatic flirtation with Beijing.\nFailing to secure any concrete agreements during his visit to China last year, his first major overseas trip, Marcos Jr quickly shifted gears and welcomed expanded security cooperation with traditional allies, most notably the US, Australia and Japan.\nAn exceptional case The Philippines, which has an American-style liberal democracy, also adopted West-leaning positions on key geopolitical issues, most notably the Ukraine conflict and the Australia-UK-US (AUKUS) nuclear-powered submarine deal.\nMoreover, the Philippines welcomed expanded military cooperation and joint drills with Australia, culminating in massive exercises as well as an unprecedented quadrilateral naval patrol in the South China Sea along with the US and Japan.\nEncouraged by Marcos Jr's strategic orientation, Albanese embarked on an official visit to Manila last year , the first by an Australian leader in almost two decades, where he signed a new bilateral strategic partnership pact.\nMarcos Jr's state visit to Australia last week, therefore, was meant to cement this new era of bilateral cooperation, with both sides signing agreements in the realm of maricreated_at and cyber cooperation as well as good governance reforms, green technology, trade and economic development.\n\"We are ambitious for the future of the Australia-Philippines relationship, which is guided by our historic Strategic Partnership I signed with President Marcos in Manila last year,\" declared Albanese during a meeting with his Filipino counterpart.\nMarcos Jr's hope to upgrade bilateral security cooperation with Australia and rally international support for his ongoing tussle with China didn't go unnoticed in Beijing.\nThe Communist Party-run Global created_ats mouthpiece newspaper lambasted the Filipino president in an editorial as playing the\"victim card [by] portraying China as 'bullying' the Philippines in the South China Sea to garner more international support and exert pressure on China.\"\nSign up for one of our free newsletters The editorial warned that Marcos Jr was placing his country\"in the wrong position\" since\"no other ASEAN countries are willing to stand behind the Philippines' South China Sea provocations.\"\nA Philippine Coast Guard ship tows a Filipino resupply vessel following damage caused by water cannon from a Chinese Coast Guard ship as it was heading towards the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, in the South China Sea, December 10, 2023. Photo: Philippine Coast Guard Handout One Chinese expert quoted in the newspaper openly warned the Southeast Asian nation against\"naive and simplistic attempts to rally external forces such as Australia will ultimately fail.\"\nIn fact, ASEAN foreign ministers issued a statement of solidarity with the Philippines last December amid repeated near-collisions between Philippine and Chinese maricreated_at vessels in the South China Sea.\nMarcos Jr has also signed several defense deals with Indonesia and Vietnam this year with an eye on counterbalancing China. Nevertheless, no other ASEAN country has openly criticized China in support of the Philippines, with even Vietnam increasingly embracing a pragmatic and conciliatory approach to its giant northern neighbor.\nIt's doubtful that ASEAN will echo Marcos Jr's more forthcoming critique of China's aggressive actions in adjacent waters. Nor is it clear that Australia, which is grappling with\npotential mission creep and massive cost overruns with its US$368 billion AUKUS submarine deal, is in a position to provide the Philippines massive military support in the South China Sea.\nBut after Marco Jr's visit, Australia can be reassured that at least one key ASEAN nation is firmly on the same page when it comes to its vision of regional security in the Indo-Pacific vis-à-vis China.\nFollow Richard Javad Heydarian on X, formerly Twitter, at @Richeyadrian\nAlready have an account?Sign i Sign up here to comment on Asia created_ats stories OR Thank you for registering!\nAn account was already registered with this email.

    "text": "\nChina's military has not fought a war since a navy battle with Vietnam in 1988, but few doubt its ambition to become the world's top fighting force. \nWith geopolitical tensions heating up over Taiwan and the South China Sea in recent years, President Xi Jinping has warned the People's Liberation Army of \"stormy seas\" ahead, telling troops to stay loyal and be ready to fight. \nThe world may learn more about the latest plan for the PLA - the biggest standing army with more than 2 million soldiers - when China's top political advisory text and the national legislature gather for the \"two sessions\" next week.  \nThousands of politicians and representatives will attend those meetings that begin on Monday, to set budgets and plans for the economy, diplomacy, trade and defence. \nMilitary spending will be closely watched for what it reveals about Beijing's strategy for the PLA. Analysts expect a \"moderate\" budget increase in 2024 given the \"more complex\" international environment, even with the slowdown in the economy. \nThey say there is no imminent plan for war - something that could be reflected in a significant expansion in defence spending.  \nInstead, Beijing is expected to continue \"buying created_at\", meaning steady growth in military spending to build up capacity so that it can achieve its goal of reunification with self-ruled Taiwan, and to narrow the military power gap with the United States.  \nBut the budget is also expected to take into account the risk of an armed conflict triggered by something \"unpredictable\", with more military encounters in the disputed South China Sea, Taiwan electing a new independence-leaning president in January, and a possible Donald Trump comeback in the US. \nThe PLA has a target of 2027 - the year of its centenary - to achieve its costly modernisation goals, paving the way for it to become a \"world class\" military power by 2049.  \nThat initial target is not far off, yet analysts expect steady growth in defence spending to continue for the 2024 financial year, even as other militaries spend more on weapons amid conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. \nGlobally, military spending jumped 9 per cent to a record US$2.2 trillion in 2023, according to a report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies released last month. That figure is set to rise this year given Israel's war on Gaza, the Ukraine conflict and rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific. \nChinese defence spending will increase but \"the question is at what rate, given China's economic slowdown\", according to Yun Sun, director of the China programme at the Stimson Centre in Washington.  \nFormer PLA equipment expert Fu Qianshao expected Beijing to \"make a moderate adjustment\" to military spending based on GDP growth. \nEconomic growth in China could drop to 4.6 per cent this year, down from 5.2 per cent in 2023, according to an International Monetary Fund forecast. It expected growth to decline for the next four years, citing factors including the crisis in the property sector. \nChina has maintained single-digit growth in its defence budget over the last eight years, including the 2023 increase of 7.2 per cent. \nAnalysts expect the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait to remain potential flashpoints this year, given more frequent military run-ins and the change in leadership in Taipei when William Lai Ching-te takes power - possibly taking a more proactive approach to his predecessor - in May. \nTensions are also running high in the South China Sea between China and the Philippines over the disputed Second Thomas Shoal as well as Scarborough Shoal, where vessels from the two sides have had regular stand-offs in recent months and a collision in December. \nFu, the former PLA equipment expert, said Beijing would implement \"strict\" measures to prevent the Philippines from taking materials to a rusting warship that was deliberately grounded on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands in the late 1990s, to build a permanent structure there. \nThe Chinese coastguard regularly tries to block Philippine vessels from taking supplies to the BRP Sierra Madre, where a small number of Filipino troops are stationed. \nAccording to Fu, the Philip­pines \"is far from becoming our rival because we have a strong coastguard and armed forces\". \nStill, he said the risks of \"unpredictable\" incidents involving Chinese and US forces in the region should not be underestimated given their frequent encounters. \n\"If some country from outside the region ramps up provocation by sending warplanes, it's likely to be seen as a threat to our national security,\" Fu said. \"It could even lead to an accidental conflict.\" \nSun from the Stimson Centre said \"if things continue in their current state\" there may not be too much of an escalation in tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea this year.  \n\"We might see more in the South China Sea, related to the Philippines, but it is far less critical for China,\" she added. \nIn Taiwan, Lai's inaugural address on May 20 will be closely watched by Beijing, which has labelled the island's next leader a \"troublemaker\". \nThere have been tensions in recent weeks near Quemoy - an archipelago also known as Kinmen and controlled by Taiwan - after the deaths of two mainland Chinese fishermen whose boat capsized during a chase by the Taiwanese coastguard.  \nThe mainland Chinese coastguard has stepped up patrols in waters near the islands, which are just a few nautical miles from the mainland city of Xiamen. \nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of its territory, to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries - including its informal ally and top arms supplier the United States - do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state but oppose any attempt to change the status quo by force. \nFu said Beijing would be waiting to see if Lai made any moves towards Taiwanese independence when he takes power. \n\"If he crosses the red line or shows an intent to collude with foreign forces in a way that challenges the situation of a peaceful resolution [to achieving Beijing's reunification goal] then patrols and exercises near Taiwan will surely be strengthened,\" he said. \nOn a range of issues, from the economy to Taiwan, Xi has repeatedly said that \"created_at and momentum is on our side\".  \nMany believe this also applies to Beijing's assessment of China's military playing catch-up with the US. \nThat includes a Beijing-based analyst who said China was \"buying created_at\" to prepare for a possible war. But the analyst, who declined to be named, said an imminent conflict was not in Beijing's plan given the gap in military power between China and the US. \nAccording to Fu, most of this year's defence spending will go towards the navy and air force, as well as its rocket force, which oversees nuclear and ballistic missiles. \nThe PLA plans to have six aircraft carrier groups by 2035. Two aircraft carriers are already in service, while sea trials are said to be nearing for its third aircraft carrier, the Fujian.  \nMeanwhile, the air force is seeking to rapidly develop its capabilities in unmanned combat - something the US has also done in recent years. Chinese analysts expect more funding in this year's defence budget to develop these advanced technologies, as well as weapons that use artificial intelligence.  \nChina also has a powerful nuclear arsenal - US officials estimate it had more than 500 warheads as of May last year, and that it was on track for 1,500 nuclear weapons by 2035. \nOn a possible Trump return to the White House after the November elections and what it could mean for China, Wu Xinbo, a professor of international relations at Fudan University, said the former president lacked a \"sense of risk management\" when it came to US-Taiwan relations.  \nWu also said Trump was \"more adventurous in causing conflicts\". \nObservers will also be watching the two sessions for developments on the latest anti-corruption purge of military officials and what it could mean for the PLA - though Beijing is likely to be reluctant to address the issue.  \nFu noted that corruption problems would have an impact on the military's combat capabilities \"so we must strengthen these anti-corruption efforts\". \nThose efforts are part of a sweeping campaign driven by Xi for over a decade, with the military among those in the spotlight in recent months.  \nIn October, Beijing abruptly removed Li Shangfu as defence minister without explanation after just seven months in the job. He has also been removed from the Central Military Commission ahead of the two sessions. \nAnd nine generals - including top commanders from the rocket force - were ousted from the legislature in December, with the National People's Congress later saying they were suspected of \"violations of discipline and the law\" - usually a euphemism for corruption.  \nEly Ratner, US assistant secretary of defence for Indo-Pacific security affairs, has speculated that high-level corruption in the PLA could have an impact on its capabilities.  \n\"I think it should give China's leadership pause about how deep and how systemic that corruption runs,\" Ratner said last month.  \n\"And to what degree this very advanced military is going to work when they need, and frankly are they ready?\"\n"

    "text": "\n A TRILATERAL partnership among Asia's most vibrant democracies and maricreated_at states-India, the Philippines and Japan-is needed to counter China's growing expansionism and the uncertainty that be brought by the return of ex-US President Donald Trump to the White House, academicians and foreign policy analysts said.\nThe Philippines has two active trilateral arrangements-first with Indonesia and Malaysia to counter piracy and sea terrorism in the common borders, and another one with the United States and Japan on regional peace and stability.\n'The one that binds us [the Philippines, India and Japan] together is that we all face a common security challenge-an aggressive, expansive and revisionist China,' Dr. Renato De Castro, trustee and program convenor of Manila-based think-tank Stratbase ADR, said.\nLike the Philippines, Japan and India have bilateral territorial disputes. Japan and China both claim the uninhabited Senkaku Island (Chinese name: Diaoyu Islands), located northeast of Taiwan. Indian and Chinese troops clashed in 2020 along the Himalayas, the longest disputed border in the world\nHiroyuki Akita, a commentator at Nikkei Asia, said Japan is trying to build a 'horizontal and more mini-lateral security' alliance in the region as it prepares for the possibility of the return of US President Donald Trump to the White House.\nAkita called the return of Trump as a 'new severe event.'\nHe said based on the latest poll in the US, the American electorate prefers to vote Trump over incumbent President Joseph Biden, worried that Biden is already too old to serve a second term.\nIf Trump wins the presidency, Akita sees two scenarios that could affect US engagement in Asia. First, he believes, Trump will adopt a softer stance on Russian President Vladimir Putin, which may ease tension in Europe, but will later on be detrimental to long-term as it would give Putin chance to expand more. Second, President Trump, on one hand, will adopt a tougher approach on China.\n'So, more military tension in South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, or weakening or shaping US alliance in the region,' Akita explained.\nThese scenarios complicate the already complex security environment in Europe with the war between Russia and Ukraine. The US, as member of NATO, is also actively helping the Ukrainians defeat Russia.\n'Unfortunately, the US can only fight one major war,' Akita said. 'There is already one war in Europe and then there is also conflict in the Middle Eat. So this is very, very bad. If there were to be a war in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, the US must either have to abandon Europe and concentrate on Asia, or US will not be able to deter.'\nForeign Affairs Undersecretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro welcomed the idea of the Philippines, India and Japan forming a trilateral coalition.\n'Trilateral cooperation is an important feature with the present global order, characterized by the duplicity of actors. In this game, increased attention in recent past as more states up for this arrangement driven by a congruent goals and common concerns such as economic and security domains,' Lazaro said.\nShe suggested that the trilateral cooperation start with Track 2 level or among academicians, just like the forum started by Stratbase ADR Friday.\nDr. Jagannath Panda, fellow at the Stockholm Center for South Asian and Indo-Pacific Affairs, said the trilateral cooperation could involve with more practical solutions, such as information sharing on Chinese maricreated_at activities.\n'A created_at has come that we should also talk about the oil exploration in the South China Sea,' Panda said, adding that Vietnam be included in the mini-lateral coalition.\nHe said there is also a need for the three countries to collaborate to jointly protect submarine cables that connect 95 percent of international data around the world.\nIndian Ambassador Shambhu Kumaran suggested that the three countries can work hand in hand to 'expand constituency for supply resiliency, for building skills relevant to the new industry of digital economy, post-Internet age, building better infrastructure that is ecologically sustainable and financially viable, and providing an alternate model to some of the infrastructure projects.'\n'I think definitely a laser line focus on critical developmental areas, such as health, agriculture, environment, climate change could be other areas valid for our trilateral relations.\n'The test for us as we walk the talk would be to develop small, workable projects that each of us can build and create the public opinion that would support the convergence of our ideas,' Ambassador Kumaran said.\n"

    "text": "\nA possible trilateral mechanism among the Philippines, Japan, and India is being explored to bolster their security, economic, technology, and development cooperation, a senior Foreign Affairs official said Friday.Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Policy Theresa Lazaro said such an arrangement “presents enormous opportunities for these countries and the broader Indo-Pacific region, not only on the prospect of new ‘strategic partnerships’ and security architecture, but also on economic and development ventures.”“This partnership can help drive the economic engines of these countries towards shared economic prosperity in the region,” Lazaro said at a forum organized by Stratbase ADR Institute in Makati City.There are no formal discussions yet on the proposed trilateral bloc, but Lazaro said she sees “no difficulties” in forging a triangular cooperation with Japan and India.“It has to go through certain formalities,” Lazaro said.Trilateral cooperation, she said, is \"an important feature of the present global order\" characterized by a multiplicity of actors.Amid a backdrop of regional uncertainties, Lazaro said more states opt for this arrangement due to common concerns, such as in the economic and security domains.Territorial disputes in the South China Sea—a busy and resource-rich waterway—have sparked occasional violence and have been regarded as a potential regional flashpoint for armed conflict. It has also been at the centre of a strategic rivalry between China and the United States.The proposed agreement would explore specific areas of strategic cooperation, including connectivity, supply chains, green transformation to manage the impacts of climate change and create greener growth pathways, Lazaro said.The Philippines, India and Japan can also “learn from their best practices, know-how, and technology in pursuing the greening of crucial economic sectors that weigh heavily,” she added.Infrastructure connectivity, she noted, is also an important aspect of the cooperation, specifically transport and logistics systems given the breadth of the Indo-Pacific region.“Infrastructure connectivity shortens distance and increases productivity. \nThe resulting benefits are manifold, among which are increased intra-regional trade, supply chain efficiency, and travel mobility,” Lazaro said.BrahMos Missiles ArrivingThe Philippines is intensifying its maricreated_at dialogue efforts with India in preparation for the delivery of BrahMos cruise missiles this March, which have been procured from the Indian government.Lazaro said, \"The Philippines currently collaborates with eight maricreated_at dialogue partners, including Japan. We seek to elevate our maricreated_at dialogue with India to a track one level in the near future.\"The forthcoming arrival of the BrahMos cruise missiles is expected to significantly bolster the firepower of the Philippine Marine Corps.In a display of bilateral respect, India has shown solidarity with the Philippines by acknowledging the 2016 arbitral tribunal ruling in favour of the Philippines, which invalidated China's expansive claims in the West Philippine Sea.Training sessions have been conducted between Indian and Philippine Coast Guard personnel, with future sessions planned for ongoing collaboration.Speaking at the Stratbase forum, India’s top envoy to the Philippines, Shambu Kumaran, said there is a need to look at international relationships beyond the bilateral ties amid the continuous security challenges in the Indo-Pacific maricreated_at domain.“Geopolitical logic of this partnership is very visible given the recent developments in the region especially maricreated_at domain,” Kumaran said, stressing the need for an immediate trilateral arrangement among the three countries is “crucial.”“Maricreated_at security will be an area of focus and I think we should look at what we can do, the three of us, and multiply what we are each doing bilaterally with each other,” he said.'Indispensable' Partners of JapanJapan, alongside India, is keen on engaging in a trilateral collaboration with the Philippines. This three-way partnership focuses on economic, agricultural, and people-to-people exchanges, with a primary emphasis on maricreated_at cooperation.Highlighting the maricreated_at domain as a key potential area for enhanced collaboration, Kumaran cited the importance of active engagement between the three nations.Deputy Chief of Mission at the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines, Kenichi Matsuda, emphasized the transformative potential of cooperative efforts within the envisioned triangular partnership. Matsuda said Japan considers the Philippines and India as “indispensable partners.”“The rising geopolitical tensions in the region expose the increasing convergence of traditional and non-traditional security threats. Now more than ever, our unified efforts in securing the regional and global commons are the greatest equalizer in upholding the rule-based order,” Matsuda said.As the formal maricreated_at dialogue between the Philippines and India progresses and trilateral cooperation advances, concerns have been raised by China regarding maricreated_at collaboration efforts between the Philippines and other nations outside the region.Chinese defence officials expressed dismay, cautioning against joint military exercises or patrols that may heighten tensions in the South China Sea, thereby violating the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.While awaiting an official response from the Department of Foreign Affairs regarding these concerns, Lazaro reaffirmed the Philippines' commitment to sovereignty and cooperative relationships with like-minded countries, especially in maricreated_at matters.Lazaro said, \"The Philippines is a sovereign nation, and we are steadfast in upholding our sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdictions. Our actions are not subject to external dictates; we seek collaboration with nations sharing similar values, particularly in maricreated_at affairs.\"This report is auto-generated from an international syndicated feed\n"

    "text": "\nIt comes as Sweden and the Philippines have been negotiating on a deal for the procurement of defence equipment that could include fighter jetsNato membership could help facilitate contact with partners in the region to coordinate on weapons supply chain or other arms issues, analyst says\nSweden's entry into Nato \"will bring opportunities\" for its arms industry in the Asia-Pacific, analysts say. That could include supplying fighter jets to Manila as tensions escalate with Beijing over the South China Sea. \nHungary's parliament approved Sweden's accession to Nato on Monday, clearing the way for it to join the transatlantic security alliance after more than 200 years of neutrality - a move prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \nIt comes as Sweden and the Philippines have been negotiating to finalise an \"implementing arrangement\" on the procurement of defence equipment. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nThe Philippine defence ministry said the deal was expected to be signed during a meeting in Sweden this month. \nAs part of the agreement, Sweden has indicated it would participate in Manila's programme to acquire multi-role fighter jets as part of a military modernisation drive known as Horizon 3, the ministry said. \nThe JAS 39 Gripen made by Swedish defence and aerospace company Saab is among the options the Philippines is considering for the new fighter jets, along with the F-16 produced by American firm Lockheed Martin. \nSwedish ambassador to the Philippines Annika Thunborg proposed the sale of up to a dozen Gripens to Manila when she met Defence Minister Gilberto Teodoro Jnr in August. \nA fourth-generation single-engine and multi-role fighter jet, the Gripen has been exported to five countries - Brazil, the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa and Thailand - since it was introduced to the Swedish Air Force in 1996. \nManila is seeking to modernise its fighter jets at a tense created_at in the South China Sea. In recent months there have been frequent run-ins between Chinese and Philippine vessels near the disputed Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands. \nModernising the fleet would certainly help Manila to project air power over its claimed maricreated_at zones in the South China Sea, according to Aaron Jed Rabena, a senior lecturer at the University of the Philippines' Asian Centre. \nRabena said the Gripens offered \"bang for the buck\" as they were cheaper to acquire and maintain than F-16s. \"Yet its specs and features are comparable to the F-16,\" he said. \"[It] is better than the current squadron of FA-50s in the Philippine Air Force's inventory.\" \nAgust Börjesson, a research fellow with the Asia programme at Stockholm-based think tank the Institute for Security and Development Policy (ISDP), said Swedish manufacturers like Saab could add significant capability and modernisation to the Philippine Air Force at a more modest price. \n\"The Asia-Pacific region is complex and prone to tensions, which naturally translates to a significant market potential among democratic partners in the region,\" Börjesson said. \n\"Swedish manufacturers like Saab have reason to be optimistic that a Nato membership will bring opportunities among Nato allies and partners in the context of the alliance's current focus on the Indo-Pacific.\" \nSweden is among the European countries that have taken a relatively hawkish stand on China's military activities in the Indo-Pacific region. Its foreign ministry last month described Beijing's conduct towards Taiwan as \"worrying\" and said \"threats of military violence are unacceptable\". \nIn China, after Sweden got the go-ahead to join Nato this week, state-run tabloid Global created_ats reported that the security situation in Europe would become \"more complicated and unstable\", citing Chinese analysts. \nZsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, an assistant professor at National Dong Hwa University in Taiwan, said that response indicated that China \"sees Europe through the lens of its strategic rivalry with the US\". \n\"In reality, Beijing wants to protect its trade with EU member states and slow down Europe's de-risking agenda, so it will not risk alienating its European partners,\" Ferenczy said. \nMirna Galic, a senior policy analyst on China and East Asia at the US Institute of Peace, said being a Nato member could help Sweden to facilitate contact with the alliance's Indo-Pacific partners to \"coordinate on the conventional weapons supply chain or other arms issues\". \n\"China does not like to see the strengthening of US alliances, and since Nato has become more aware of security challenges that China poses for Nato, China has also become more wary,\" Galic said. \nSwedish arms contractors like Saab have already emerged as key players in the international arms trade, especially in the Indo-Pacific, where their activities will grow along with those of other Nato members, according to Jagannath Panda, head of the ISDP's Stockholm Centre for South Asian and Indo-Pacific Affairs. \nHe said global politics was becoming more bipolar between the US and China and noted that Sweden would share a closer security undertaking with Washington and its allies as a Nato member. \n\"In other words, Sweden's entry into Nato explains the fact that its relationship with China will never be in order,\" Panda said. \n\"Since most of the Nato members perceive Russia as an enemy from the past and China as an enemy for the future, Sweden's foreign policy will be drawn almost in a similar parallel fashion.\" \nCopyright (c) 2024.

    "title": "Why the MILAN matters to Southeast Asian countries",
    "created_at": "2024-03-02",
    "text": "\nThe MILAN is an India-hosted biennial multi-national naval exercise that originated in 1995. The exercise aims to enhance cooperation and interoperability among the navies of diverse participating countries. What often gains significant attention is how MILAN has become an avenue for India to demonstrate its diplomatic leadership by spearheading naval cooperation among countries that consider one another as strategic competitors, such as the United States, Israel, and Western European countries on the one hand, and Russia and Iran on the other. However, along with the involvement of major powers of varied political spectrums, the MILAN is also an essential avenue for Southeast Asian countries to expand their naval engagements beyond their traditional geographical neighborhood. While Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand have been participating since 1995, the scope of invited countries from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has gradually expanded with the participation of Malaysia in 1997, Myanmar in 2003, and Brunei, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Vietnam in 2012. The 2024 iteration of the MILAN will witness the maximum participation of over 50 countries, including all eight ASEAN countries. \nWhat makes this year’s MILAN even more significant for Southeast Asian countries is the geopolitical backdrop against which it is held. Today, the security dynamics between the Indian and Pacific Oceans are becoming increasingly interdependent due to the deepening and broadening of traditional and non-traditional security threats. Southeast Asian countries depend highly on the security of vital sea lines of communication (SLOCs) in the Indian Ocean for their energy and trade interests. Consequently, the ongoing strikes on multi-national commercial vessels by the Yemen-based Houthi are exacerbating the security conditions of these critical trade routes, which come at the expense of the economic interests of Southeast Asian countries, especially at a created_at when oil demand in the region is expected to increase further in the next five to ten years. Moreover, there has also been a spike in piracy incidents not only in the Western Indian Ocean, but also in critical maricreated_at bottlenecks such as the Malacca Strait, which not only links the Andaman Sea of the Eastern Indian Ocean to the South China Sea but also serves as a transit for over 40 percent of global commodities. Therefore, any threats to such commercial sea passages can lead to an increase in the deployment of navies of major powers in the maricreated_at space, catalyzing more insecurity and competition in the region. In addition, the safety of the crew onboard vessels is also a significant cause of concern to Southeast Asian countries, given that a large percentage of seafarers come from the region – the Philippines and Indonesia are the largest and third largest suppliers of seafarers, respectively. Therefore, given the turbulent security conditions across the Indo-Pacific's maricreated_at domain, it is critical for Southeast Asian countries to actively take part in securing their interests not just in the Pacific but also in the Indian Ocean. Southeast Asian navies have traditionally maintained a limited and even marginal presence in the Indian Ocean due to geographical and diplomatic constraints. Moreover, maricreated_at Southeast Asian countries have often been preoccupied with the security dilemma brought by China’s assertiveness and expansionist ambitions in the South China Sea. Nevertheless, it is crucial for Southeast Asian navies to increase their activities to their west to more proactively address emerging security challenges and harness their regional identities of being not only Southeast Asian but also resident Indo-Pacific countries. Therefore, given that the MILAN is among the few multi-national exercises of such scale that include the participation of almost all ASEAN members, this can provide Southeast Asian countries the opportunity to bolster intra-ASEAN maricreated_at security cooperation, signal the bloc’s desire to take an active position in geopolitical spaces beyond the Western Pacific and strengthen its diplomatic engagements with like-minded partners in the greater Indo-Pacific, thus aligning with the goals enshrined in the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP).Accordingly, the MILAN exercise allows ASEAN navies to improve interoperability among themselves by conducting joint drills, exercises, and simulations, which can further enhance intra-regional coordination and cooperation in maricreated_at operations like search and rescue, disaster relief, and anti-piracy efforts. Along with improving interoperability, the MILAN provides an essential opportunity for Southeast Asian countries to actively contribute toward information-sharing mechanisms during the exercise, including exchanging knowledge and best practices in maricreated_at security, surveillance, and intelligence gathering. This collaboration will strengthen Indo-Pacific maricreated_at security and aid in countering common maricreated_at threats. Moreover, the MILAN also serves as a notable platform for capacity building among Southeast Asian navies, providing opportunities for training in areas such as maricreated_at warfare tactics, maricreated_at domain awareness, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations. Therefore, the participation of Southeast Asian countries in MILAN significantly converges with the objectives of the AOIP. Strengthening the capacity of ASEAN countries’ participation in MILAN 2024 reaffirms the bloc’s commitment to upholding the rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific and promoting multilateral security initiatives with the active involvement of ASEAN members.

Only Myanmar will be unrepresented, with its military junta barred from major ASEAN events because of its failure to agree to a peace deal.\nWhile Mr Albanese will have bilateral meetings with all leaders before Wednesday's retreat, the visits of Mr Marcos, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, Laos PM Sonexay Siphandone and Vietnamese PM Pham Minh Chinh have a higher status as official Guests of Government, with additional programs.\n\"Building Australia's links with the countries of South-East Asia is a priority for the government,\" Mr Albanese said. \"The special summit commemorates our shared history and focuses firmly on the future - on how we can deepen our ties and Australia's engagement with our region.\n\"Australia sees ASEAN at the centre of a stable, peaceful, and prosperous region. Strengthening our relationship ensures our shared future prosperity and security.\" As part of Mr Chinh's program, he and Mr Albanese may sign a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), in a significant boost to bilateral ties. During his official visit to Hanoi last year, Mr Albanese flagged the new agreement would soon be completed and said it would elevate Vietnam to the ranks of a top-tier partner. Australia's ambassador to Vietnam, Andrew Goledzinowski, last month told local media that the CSP negotiations were a top priority so that \"leaders can announce this at an appropriate created_at\".\nVietnam has comprehensive strategic partnerships with only a handful of countries. It has agreements with China, India, Russia and South Korea, but late last year also elevated the US and Japan to the ranks of Comprehensive Strategic Partners.\nWhile Vietnam shares a border with China, relations with its fellow communist regime have been rocky at created_ats and Hanoi is looking to Western nations and one-created_at enemies as its own hedge against Beijing. In his address to parliament on Thursday, Mr Marcos declared his country was on the \"front line\" of threats to the regional order. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said the South China Sea was \"generally stable\" at the moment and \"relevant countries' maricreated_at security co-operation should not undermine other countries' interests or disrupt regional peace and stability\".\nAs well as political leaders, next week's summit will bring together business figures, academics and emerging leaders. It will be built around four themes of boosting economic engagement, accelerating the clean energy transition, increasing maricreated_at co-operation and supporting emerging leaders. It marks the 50th anniversary of Australia becoming ASEAN's first dialogue partner.\n"

Newly qualified paramedic Bushra joins Kelsea for her shift in this episode, and they treat a 40-year-old man who is bleeding from the head after a fall following a seizure. He's lost consciousness and the bleeding is severe, so senior paramedic Debbie (right) comes to assist. Their next shout also involves a fall. An 82-year-old woman lay on the floor all night because she thought she might eventually get up on her own. As ever, each shift sheds light on the complex, individual needs of every single patient the ambulance crews encounter.\nbring the Drama 9pM, BBc2.. Casualty actor Charles Venn, who plays Jacob - 'Holby's answer to Robin Hood', according to his BBC character biography - will be putting the actors through their paces this week as they bite the medical drama bullet. Fans of Casualty will know all too well what's involved with bringing to life characters such as Jacob. They have to keep the action flowing, as well as conveying whatever personal issues their characters are also dealing with. Who will make a full recovery, and who will need a sick note?\nthe titan sub Disaster: minute by minute 9pM, ch5.. The search and rescue operation made global titles in June last year, but unlike the MH370 flight (see Why Planes Vanish, above left), the fate of the Titan submersible did become painfully clear. This two-part documentary series charts the race against created_at to locate the sub and rescue the five people on board - the youngest, a 19-year-old university student who was with his father. What should have been a thrilling adventure to visit the most famous shipwreck on the planet, the Titanic, ended in tragedy - but the story did not end there. In the second part, at 9pm tomorrow, deepdive teams locate debris on the ocean floor and, as the passengers' fate is understood, the questions start coming. Why did the expedition go so catastrophically wrong? And could it have been avoided?\nNAKED attraction 10.35pM, ch4 ???.. Bright and bubbly Anna Richardson is back, sparing no blushes, as what is surely the boldest dating show ever conceived starts its 12th series. If you're unfamiliar with the format, it's a blind date scenario with a brazen touch as participants are in the altogether - matches are made based on naked bodies, rather than faces, never mind personalities. It doesn't end there, though, and the show does go deeper than skin deep. As for how successful the matches are, there are plenty of couples who met on the show - if not necessarily matched on the show - who are still together. So, if your dating life is lacklustre and all else has failed, perhaps it's created_at to try finding love in the buff?\nDocumentary the rise AND fall of boris johnson 9pM, ch4 ????...

    "text": "\nRep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia, issued the following news on March 1, 2024:\nToday, Congresswoman Jen Kiggans (VA-02) announced she has cosponsored H.R. 7372, the Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act. This bipartisan legislation provides the necessary authorities to secure the U.S. southern border as well as critical, defense-only funding for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. The border security authorities and defense funding would be in effect for one year following enactment of the bill.\n\"We are living in a dangerous world, from the threats at our own borders to those in the South China Sea, Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine, and Hamas' renewed reign of terror in the Middle East,\" said Congresswoman Kiggans. \"We need to display our strength on the world stage. Our friends should trust us, and our enemies should fear us. It's not enough to simply acknowledge these threats...we have to take immediate action to deter them alongside our allies.\"\n\"That's why I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act,\" continued Congresswoman Kiggans. \"This bill is critical to the safety of our great nation and the security of our allies and the world. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation so that we can secure our borders and help our allies maintain stability across the globe.\"\nBACKGROUND\nThe Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act was originally introduced by Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01), Jared Golden (ME-02), Don Bacon (NE-02), Ed Case (HI-01), Mike Lawler (NY-17), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA-03), Lori Chavez-DeRemer (OR-05), and Jim Costa (CA-21).\nBorder security provisions in the legislation include:\n* Suspending entry of inadmissible aliens to achieve operational control over U.S. borders;\n* Implementing a \"Remain in Mexico\" policy by requiring that an alien seeking admission (including asylum) and arriving on land from a foreign territory contiguous to the U.S. be returned to that territory pending proceedings for the adjudication of the alien's status;\n* Requiring an immigration officer who determines that a migrant arriving in the U.S. or along the southern border is inadmissible to be detained and expelled to Mexico (or their nation of origin, birth, or residence) without further hearing or review.\n- Exceptions for aliens claiming to be threatened with persecution or torture would not be permissible if:\n** the alien has ordered or participated in the persecution another individual;\n** the alien, having been convicted of a particularly serious crime, is a danger to U.S. citizens;\n** there is reason to believe the alien committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the U.S.; and/or\n** there are reasonable grounds to believe the alien is a danger to U.S. national security.\n* Prohibiting the use of federal funds to transfer an alien in the custody of the Government from a facility in which they were first detained to another location for a purpose other than adjudicating the alien's status.\nSupport for our allies in the legislation includes a total of $66.32 billion in defense-funding, specifically:\n* $47.69 billion to support the defense of Ukraine.\n* $10.40 billion to support the defense of Israel.\n* $4.91 billion to support the U.S. and allied deterrence operations in the Indo-Pacific.\n* $2.44 billion to support operations in U.S. Central Command, including to address combat expenditures related to recent conflict in the Red Sea.\n* $542 million for U.S. Indo-Pacific Command to address critical, unfunded operations.\nHaving lived at Naval Air Station Atsugi as a military spouse for three years while her husband was forward deployed in Japan, Congresswoman Kiggans has a deep understanding and great appreciation for the critical role our military forces play in Asia and the sacrifices made by our military members and their families deployed there.\n* * *\nOriginal text here: \nCopyright Targeted News Services\nMSTRUCK-8511055 MSTRUCK\n"

    "text": "\nSpeech to text transcript:1\neconomic security, particularly within the tech sector is far less well understood and I think it is something we would like to see the Government to and we are happy that this inquiry started as a bit of a conversation around what we mean when we talk about economic security? Be aware of the policy implements that can sort of live in that area but we want to make sure that it is not conflated with national security, that we have a clear understanding of economic security but in general but also within the... Will it ever be... That ever be possible to get to that position of total economic security. I would really doubt that would be possible because it would be that going back with everything on the land and not trade because that is ultimately the way you would get to economic security and that would be very expensive for the peace created_at? I think so. \nAnd I cannot speak on the sort of wider economic point but if you look at the tech supply chains that we have across the world, you know, an example, I've got a smartphone in my pocket. They're both member so I cannot name which one is which Budget talking about 3 million people, 52 countries, thousands of countries and organisations in that supply chain from smelters to software developers. You know, both hardware and the software side. So for you to try to onshore that, it will take you an age to actually just understand the different components that sit within that one supply chain, that one item. I also don't think it would lead to you being secure. And actually, certainly, we see security and openness of trade as not being necessarily in contention with each other and actually very much, you want both of those because that is how you deliver each of them. So I think that, sort of, mitigations about what is clearly a sort of open global trading order that is under pressure apps at the D but you can certainly swing the barometer way too far and that would limit economic growth as well. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm going to move on now to question. I want to address the issue of maricreated_at risk which is very much in the news at the moment with the attacks on the Red Sea, but we also hear a lot about the South China Sea and loads going to the Panama Canal, so my question is, how effective is the UK Government's policy to address these issues and how does it affect our UK economic security? Well, thank you very much. Thank you for inviting me. My field of expertise is see powers so you can imagine I've got a lot to see about this so please feel free to interrupt me. I'm conscious of the created_at. So I would like to say that this is extremely important for the UK's economic security and national security. We all know the numbers when it comes to the global supply chain, 90 or 95% of import-export in volume and we also understand that it is not just the UK trade, it is also an industry that dependency because the hardware that the use of the infrastructure, the service industry uses is dependent on freedom of navigation because there is needs to import by C. Also we can talk about the critical national infrastructure so I just want to start by saying that the question is not easy to see, important for the UK's economic security and national security. Why is it more important to think about that and it is because there is a conjunction of political, economic and technological resource factors altogether and the geopolitical level, with got disruptors, we've got the UK's competitors or enemies trying to disrupt freedom of navigation and that is in the context of this impending global leadership challenge by the forces of authoritarianism and the forces of authoritarianism and the West's global dominance and this global dominance by the West is based on our ability to control the maricreated_at domain, so that is very important.\n"

    "created_at": "2024-03-02",
    "text": "\n                     FOR ten years it is the mystery that has left the world baffled.                   \nOn March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight Mhl0  departed Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.\nBut 38 minutes into its journey , at 1.20am, it lost contact with air traffic controllers over the South China Sea. \nThe fate of the Boeing 777  and its 239 passengers and crew remains unknown. \nFrench investigative journalist Florence de Changy  has been probing the disappearance  for a decade and is the author of an explosive book into the mystery. \nShe says: “It is shocking for the families. \n“The official narrative has been so strongly imposed on them that they have no choice but to stick to that and the only thing they can ask for is to keep searching.\n“They worry if they start to doubt the authorities, they will start to break talks with them.”\nToday, in an exclusive interview, Florence  challenges key parts of the official version of events. \n                                                                     The Disappearing Act: The Impossible Case of Mhl0, by Florence de Changy (Harper Collins) is out now, priced £9.99.                                                               \n                     FLIGHT PATHKey to the mystery                   \nTHE official line is the plane was tracked by radar crossing Malaysia  and vanished over the Andaman Sea.\nSatellite analysis was said to have shown it U-turned and likely plummeted into the Southern Indian Ocean. \nA potential crash site was identified 1,500 miles south west of Australia.  \nThe search there was the most expensive in aviation history.\nYet, apart from disputed pieces of debris, there was no trace of the plane.\nFlorence found evidence from Vietnamese air traffic control and intelligence sources that suggest the plane met its fate at around 2.45am north of Vietnam  – two minutes after a mayday saying the cabin was disintegrating.\nShe said: “I am surer than ever there was no crash in the Southern Indian Ocean.\n“The plane continued to fly until 2.40am.”\n                     DEBRISWas it planted?                   \nINVESTIGATORS said the first debris found, on July 29, 2015, was a section from the right wing called a flaperon. \nIt was on a beach on Reunion Island , a French territory near Mauritius , around 3,500 miles from Malaysia. \nBut Florence said: “There are good reasons not to believe it is from Mhl0. \n“First, they never even established the provenance of the flaperon. This is shocking.\n“Secondly, they said the flaperon suffered two consecutive shocks, which does not fit a crash in the ocean.\n“Also, that piece of broken composite material is not meant to float.\n“But in the fiercest ocean on the planet it must have travelled up to ten miles a day in a straight line over 500 days to reach Reunion. \n“Plus, it lost its ID plate, which is an enormous red flag. I am certain it was planted or is unrelated.”\n                     THE CAPTAINSuspect or innocent?                   \nSUSPICION initially fell on captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 52,  who was branded a troubled man with a chaotic love life. \nThe Malaysian Prime Minister at the created_at even hinted Zaharie  may be behind a murder-suicide plot.\nBut Florence says: “An important aspect I think is that the captain is innocent. \n“He has been at the centre of many accusations and smear campaigns. \n“I have spoken to people who knew him and saw confidential police reports about him and I am convinced he was a good man and had nothing to do with the fate of the plane.”\n                     CARGOWas it a cover?                   \nACCORDING to the cargo manifest , 4.5 tons of fresh mangosteens, a tropical fruit, were on board, as well as 2.5 tons of small electrical items.\nBut Florence said: “The mangosteens made no sense. It was not the right season, it was a ridiculous amount. \n“Then I found they were on every Mhl0 flight for the next month.\n“The largest hub for illegal trade between Africa and China is Kuala Lumpur airport. \n“Mangosteens could be a cover for all sorts of things, including rhino horns or elephant tusks.”\nShe said of the electrical items: “The official report said this cargo was not X-rayed. This is a big problem.”\nFlorence thinks the load could have forced an emergency landing, adding: “I believe there was a cargo confiscation operation. If you’re surrounded by military planes, you follow orders.”\n                     AIR CHIEFWas expert silenced?                   \nAT the created_at of the tragedy, Sir Tim Clark, the British president of Emirates airline , said almost every other missing flight in history had been “at least five or ten per cent trackable” and that Mhl0’s  disappearance raised “a degree of suspicion”.\nFlorence claimed the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which led the initial search, asked him to stop commenting. \nShe said: “He had the largest fleet of those planes and said he did not believe they had lost one. Months later he was silenced.” \nSir Tim said in an interview she was right about him being silenced.\n"

    "created_at": "2024-03-02",
    "text": "\n THE country's top envoy to Washington D.C. is anxious that an incident in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) would trigger the Philippines to invoke the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) with the Americans.\n'We are facing today one of the most difficult challenges that we have for our country. From where I am sitting in Washington D.C. we don't see the light at the end of the tunnel to a certain extent. Never in our lifecreated_at even during World War II did we face such a challenge because this country will not let up on their claim in many of our territorial waters,' Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel 'Babe' Romualdez said during a forum with the Consular Corps.\nRomualdez disclosed that the Chinese aggression on Philippine military, Coast Guard and fisherfolk in WPS 'is very real.'\n'All of these skirmishes that is happening there, there can be one major accident and either one of our countries the US or the PHL can invoke the MDT and when we do, a commitment made by the US or the commitment we make will happen and then all hell breaks loose,' he said.\nThe Philippines and the US have a 52 year old defense treaty that obliges one to come to the aid of another when attacked. American officials have repeatedly clarified that the MDT encompasses an attack in the South China Sea.\nThe Philippine ambassador said his second cousin, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., would call him somecreated_ats past midnight for him to verify with the Americans about particular incidents in the WPS.\n'We want to avoid having to find a situation where we will have to call each other, saying we want to invoke the Mutual Defense Treaty, you have to defend us because the Chinese are already in our shores. We hope it will never happen and believe me that keeps a lot of us awake at night because there were created_ats when I would get a call from the President at 2 in the morning...and he tells me you've got to find out this thing happened and so on and so forth,' he said.\nRomualdez believes the 'real flashpoint' in Southeast Asia is not the Taiwan Strait but in the WPS.\n'All of us, all Filipinos should be made aware of on how important it is that we are united in facing this very big challenge to our country,' he said. 'We really need to be concerned about-what happens in our shores and in our territory that is really where the flashpoint is,' Romualdez added.\nRomualdez said he is 'hoping and praying' that the relations between the Philippines and China would not turn bitter.\nThe senior diplomat claimed that Manila 'wants to avoid' a situation wherein the Philippines would be forced to choose between a country that bullies us or the country that will work with us.\n'It's an old saying that [US President] George Bush Jr. said, in my view the way I see it now, because of what we are facing and the bullying that we are facing is the question that we will ask to other countries-either you're with us or against us. And that's something that we want to avoid. It's a fact of life. When your sovereignty is already being challenged many countries in Europe are facing that now it's the same question-are you with us or against us,' he added.\nTaiwan Strait\nHe said many among the intelligence community in the US believe that the US is also doing 'everything they can' to stop China from attacking Taiwan, its renegade province.\nHe cited his Australian counterpart and former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd who believes Chinese President Xi Jinping will not make a move on Taiwan unless 'he is absolutely sure that [Xi] can militarily take over Taiwan.'\n'So deterrence is the only way to stop them from going into that kind of situation. So we're hoping that every morning when President Xi wakes up he's going to say- today's not the day,' Romualdez said.\nUS politics\nThe Philippines-China maricreated_at dispute has become 'very challenging' from the viewpoint in the Washington D.C. as the US will have another elections in November this year.\n'The question now that we all ask is what is going to happen in November this year in Washington D.C.?' Romualdez said.\nHe said good thing he maintained contacts with US Ambassador Robert O'Brien, former national security adviser during the Trump administration. Romualdez was also the Philippine ambassador to the US during the tenure of former president Donald Trump.\n'[O'Brien], one of the close advisers of president Trump, has indicated that most likely if President Trump is lucky to get back to the White House, he will not change his policy towards the Indo-Pacific region,' he said.\nHe stressed that maintaining friends from both the Democrats and Republican parties is important and he made sure that they know that the Philippines continue to 'stand by our number one ally and that we will continue to work with them on many things that is good for both our countries.'\n'It is important that the message must be clear-that if we do not help each other it can indeed spell the end of the world. Why do I say it is the end of the world? We all know what the weapons of mass destruction are today. It is not a joke anymore. World War II was a different story but if we have a World War III, we know that it is the end of the world. Diplomacy is still the best option to pursue rather than engage in any conflict,' he emphasized.\n"

    "title": "Malaysia Must Be Bold And Strategic In South China Sea – Analysis",
    "created_at": "2024-03-03",
    "text": "\nMalaysia's conventional and decades old approach to the South China Sea conflict in using quiet and backdoor diplomacy is once again in the limelight with the repeated incursions and grey zone operations by Beijing over the years, the latest on February 17 where the China Coast Guard 5403 vessel sailed off the coast of Malaysia. Most of these including the latest incident did not get much awareness and attention.\nAccording to SeaLight, a Stanford University project focused on grey zone activities in the South China Sea, it sets off a period of intrusive patrolling into Malaysia's oil and gas fields and the patrol is still ongoing.\nPast incidents including the West Capella incident has seen Malaysia's intent to prevent an escalatory aftermath, and even chastising Washington's intent to offer support.\nBeijing claims about 95 percent of the 3.5 million-square-kilometer South China Sea, covering fishery-rich waters that Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines also claim.\nPublic awareness and understanding have been low, and the critical importance of Malaysia's oil and gas deposits to the national economy and as the predominant tool for national survival in empowering the country's economy has not been fully grasped and understood by the quarters.\nManila has taken a direct approach in standing up to its rights and in using the exposure method to expose the realities on the sea, recording the various incursions and intimidating actions taken by the Chinese vessels for a wider global audience.\nMalaysia has for long avoided that path, and the future risks remain unforeseen as to how long the country can rely on this approach in safeguarding its economic and trade interests with Beijing without harming the long term sovereignty and energy security.\nExperts have pointed out that there were indications Beijing was using cyber espionage to bolster its grey zone operations in the South China Sea, including to prevent Malaysia from developing its gas fields.\nOthers can call this in whatever terms academically or technically, but the fact remains that the Beijing orbit and the fear factor remain the region's biggest Achilles heel with intensifying arms races and spiralling security dilemma. China continues to use its economic influence and tools to dictate elsewhere in Southeast Asia, in exchange for tolerance of its activities in the disputed sea.\nPerpetual Economic Dependence Trap\nChina has been Malaysia's largest trading partner since 2009, with total trade between both nations reaching a record US$203.6 billion in 2022. In the same year, Malaysia's exports of palm oil and related products to China amounted to US$3.72 billion, accounting for 11.4 per cent of the country's total worldwide exports of these products.\nIn 2023, China stated that it would invest an estimated US$38.64 billion in Malaysia, including in the petrochemical and automotive industries, while Chinese carmaker Geely in July announced a US$10 billion plan to develop Malaysia's auto-making hub.\nThese statistics reaffirmed the deep economic trap that Kuala Lumpur is facing in its external economic ties, and despite recent overtures to diversify the source of trade and resources and supply chain resilience, the results and returns have been paltry, looking at the statistics.\nThis creates a lose-lose situation where efforts to strengthen defensive and deterrent capacities will be futile and derailed, as the country is trapped in not being able to explore and expand the full spectrum of security options with external powers, especially the West. Talks or security strategies to form direct alliances with the West or the formation of Asian Nato or in hosting American forces and providing docking bases for AUKUS submarines are all off the table at least for years, in as long as the Beijing trap of economic dependence and the country's decades old non-alignment mantra are in place.\nAs much as Malaysia has started to diversify its defence and security ties with the courting of Japan, Turkiye and other Middle Eastern partners, the fact remains that the US remains the biggest and most important defence partner and assurance for Malaysia.\nIn December, Japan and Malaysia sealed a security assistance deal that included a US$2.8 million grant to boost Malaysia's maricreated_at security, and the provision of rescue boats and supplies.\nThis new OSA venture is limited by the scope and type of assets delivered and is a symbolic message being sent to Beijing and regional players that it has the options to leverage on other regional players for defence.\nHowever, for as long as the subdued stance on the South China Sea and the neutrality dogma persist, it is hard for real and credible deterrence and defensive capacities to be galvanised without direct military alliances and involvement of Washington and the West.\nBeijing's continuous grey zone and cabbage strategies in the disputed zones create a dangerous second front of escalating and spiralling tensions in the region, apart from the Taiwan dilemma.\nAnother perplexing dogma is Malaysia's deal to buy Chinese naval ships for its defensive and deterrence needs, where one of the main risks to Malaysia's assets and sovereignty in South China Sea is China itself.\nBeijing's Persistent Naval Pressure\nThe Asia Maricreated_at Transparency Initiative (AMTI), a research institution at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington D.C., asserted that, China Coast Guard (CCG) presence in the South China Sea is more robust than ever, in maintaining near-daily patrols at key features claimed by China and other neighboring countries. This portrays Beijing's iron clad determination to assert control over the claimed nine dash line, as stated in the report.\nAccording to AMTI, such survey vessel incursions are part of Beijing's attempts to assert control over the South China Sea.\nBeijing has also conducted dozens of other surveys throughout the South China Sea in recent years that ventured into the EEZs of Southeast Asian nations. China's survey fleet is the largest and most active in the Indo-Pacific.\nThe survey fleet and actions serve as both sending a message to regional players, and providing valuable data for civilian and military purposes, including geologic assessments and detecting submarines.The vessels used can also utilise onboard technologies to gather naval intelligence on foreign military facilities and vessels.\nAs AMTI reported, Beijing operates under a double standard where it demands other nations request permission to conduct military surveys in its EEZ but does not get permission for its vessels to conduct surveys abroad.\nAnalysts including Gaute Friis, a defence innovation scholar at Stanford's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, said there were indications that Beijing was using cyber espionage to support its grey zone operations in the South China Sea, including to prevent Malaysia from developing its subsea gas fields.\nFriis also pointed to recent evidence where some of these cyber operations were aimed at gathering information from the growing Coastguard capacities to pressure offshore energy companies in Kasawari.\nEscaping Ingrained Defence Trap\nMalaysia has always been a maricreated_at nation, but it lacks sufficient naval deterrent capacity.Regardless of how much and hard Malaysia is going to upgrade its naval capacity and other military and deterrent capabilities, it will never match the power capacities of Beijing and its expansive and runaway naval expansion. Choosing the right allies and security partners therefore remains critical. China maintains the world's third strongest military compared to Malaysia at No. 34, according to the database GlobalFirePower.com.\nReliance on preventive diplomacy and the sustained use of existing multilateral framework including ASEAN concept of neutrality and conflict prevention mechanism to reduce risks has not yielded the results.\nAs much as Malaysia knows that it needs to move beyond the stagnating approach of wait and see approach and backdoor diplomacy, including the monitoring capacity of the movements in the South China Sea with the new procurement of long range radar assets from France, it is still limited by the constraint of budget and internal constraints in the defence and procurement domains.\nMalaysia must increase its total defence mechanism, especially in seeing how other regional members have been increasing the GDP percentage spending on defence.\nThe West and Pact of Democracies Remain the Best Bet\nMalaysia will need continuous Western support in key bases for naval readiness and deterrent capacity in key zones especially Penang and Melaka in Strait of Malacca and Kuantan base and Sarawak and Sabah for the deterrent and second strike capacity that can slow the counter efforts by China in case of a full blown conflict in South China Sea and Taiwan\nHowever, in near term prospect, Malaysia might not directly pivot to the West for such overtures and assurance in preserving its strict non aligned mantra, but will continue to procure low to medium scale and non lethal assets in upping the monitoring capabilities in a level that is not desired to invite backfiring measures from Beijing.\nIn the long term calculation, Malaysia will want to strengthen joint regional security capacity, readiness and resilience at the ASEAN common solidarity level. Malaysia will pursue a concurrent three-pronged approach of defence diversification, regional solidarity and continuous traditional defence support in the near term.\nThis is insufficient and needs to change. Malaysia must be bold to dictate and change its own defence and security needs.Malaysia must strategically place itself to get the best of the West's China containment from Australia, Japan, the UK, India and the US. By this, a direct and deeper military alliance and security partnership is needed as the most credible and reassuring critical defensive need in the future, with proper guardrails and friendshoring strategies.\nEfforts to expand the Quad and a possible Asian Nato will be the strategies of the future, adding to the current FPDA and bilateral defensive overtures and diversification. A new near geographical regional defensive pact can also be explored in the form of similar threat response and commonality in the values of freedom and democracy and as an effective complement to the FPDA in the form of Malaysia-India-Indonesia-Singapore-Australia pact (MIISA). To this end, the West and the pooled strength of democracies will always be the best bet.\n"

    "text": "\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Philippine Foreign Minister Enrique Manalo urged regional neighbors Monday to stand together more strongly in upholding the rule of law in the South China Sea, where China is forcefully pursuing territorial claims in conflict with other nations.\nManalo spoke at a forum on maricreated_at cooperation on the sidelines of a Southeast Asian leaders’ summit in the Australian city of Melbourne at which increasingly assertive moves by China is high on the agenda.\nManalo referred to the Philippines’ victory over China in a 2016 arbitration ruling in The Hague, Netherlands, that invalidated Beijing’s vast territorial claims in the South China Sea. China did not accept the ruling.\nManalo said the Philippines pursued the case to uphold the rule of law and to promote the peaceful settlement of such disputes.\n“The shared stewardship of the seas and oceans in the region behooves us to unite in preserving the primacy of international law so we can ensure equitable and sustainable outcomes for all,” he said.\n“It also calls for us to stand firmly together in opposing actions that contradict or are inconsistent with international law,” he added.\nChina claims sovereignty over virtually the entire South China Sea, which is one of the world’s most crucial waterways for shipping. That has put it at odds with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei, which all maintain claims to islands, reefs and undersea resources in the region.\nManalo called for regional neighbors to uphold cooperation over confrontation and diplomacy over the threatened use of force.\n“For the South China Sea and the seas and oceans of the Indo-Pacific to be unifying domains of peace, stability and prosperity, we need to gather more strongly around the collective responsibility as well as a shared sense of stewardship,” he said.\nAustralian Foreign Minister Penny Wong echoed Manalo’s comments, saying the nine member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations represented at the Melbourne summit need to “nuture and protect agreed rules, uphold international law, prevent conflict and build strategic trust.”\n“Shared prosperity is an incentive to maintain peace, yet it is not enough to guarantee peace. The stakes are clear,” Wong said.\n“We know that a major conflict in our region would be devastating to our communities and economies, as the terrible conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine have shown,“ she added.\nShe announced that Australia would spend 40 million Australian dollars ($26 million) on enhancing its maricreated_at partnerships in the region aimed at both security and prosperity.\n           Australia and the Philippines, conducted joint sea and air patrols in the South China Sea for the first created_at in November.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Manalo in December that China will maintain military pressure on the Philippines in the South China Sea.\nWang “warned that if the Philippine side misjudges the situation, goes its own way, or even colludes with ill-intentioned external forces to continue to stir up troubles, China will defend its rights in accordance with law and respond resolutely,” the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\nWang’s comments followed China’s mobilization of its coast guard and maricreated_at militia to block Philippine supply missions to support its soldiers and fishermen.\n"

    "title": "Unveiling the motives behind the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act",
    "created_at": "2024-03-03",
    "text": "\nBangladesh, March 3 -- Philippine Senate recently approved the amendment to the Marine Zones Act (S. No. 2492) in its third reading, following the unanimous passage of the bill by the Philippine House of Representatives in 2023. This significant legislative development reflects the countrys diligent efforts in enhancing maricreated_at governance. The primary objective of this amendment is to provide greater clarity regarding maricreated_at boundaries and establish a robust legal framework for asserting exclusive jurisdiction over the claimed maricreated_at territories. Grounded in principles outlined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and bolstered by the South China Sea Arbitration Award, the Philippines aims to fortify its legal standing and assert its rights within its maricreated_at domains. This legislative endeavor underscores the nations commitment to upholding international law while safeguarding its maricreated_at interests.\nIn 2013, at the urging and with the backing of the United States, the Philippines initiated the South China Sea arbitration case, purportedly aiming to legitimize its unlawful occupation of islands and reefs in the Nansha region. The underlying motive seemed to be a bid to solidify its gains and constrain Chinas sovereignty and maricreated_at entitlements. However, the arbitration process unfolded with numerous deviations from fundamental principles expected of international judicial and arbitral bodies. The tribunal overstepped its jurisdiction and delivered an award riddled with deficiencies. This spectacle underscored the unsuitability of coercively dragging intricate South China Sea disputes into a judicial forum without due regard for the complexities involved. Moreover, the imposition of third-party arbitration procedures without the consent of the concerned state strayed from the original intent behind the UNCLOS dispute resolution mechanism. Consequently, it eroded trust among UNCLOS member states regarding the efficacy and fairness of the dispute resolution mechanisms, raising doubts about their practical applicability in resolving maricreated_at disputes.\nSince the 1950s, the Philippines has persistently pursued its territorial ambitions in the South China Sea, employing various tactics over created_at. Alongside the unlawful occupation of certain islands and reefs, the Philippines has utilized civilian expeditions, grounded warships on reefs, exploited the dispute settlement mechanisms of maricreated_at law, and revised domestic legislation to gradually expand its territorial reach beyond the confines established by international treaties. Notably, recent amendments to Philippine domestic laws have sought to reframe territorial claims as maricreated_at jurisdiction claims. This strategic maneuvering deliberately sidesteps acknowledging the illegality of its occupation of islands and reefs in the Nansha region while disregarding the foundational principle of &#8220;land dominating the sea&#8221; enshrined in international law. Such actions reflect a concerted effort to circumvent legal and political realities while advancing territorial objectives in the South China Sea.\nPhilippines advancement of maricreated_at zone legislation is seen as a deliberate provocation against China, reflecting the lingering repercussions of the South China Sea arbitration. The legislation repeatedly cites the arbitral award as the cornerstone of the Philippine claim, intending to enshrine its principles into domestic law. Once enacted, this legislation is poised to further constrict the political maneuvering space for both the Philippines and China in crisis management and dispute resolution efforts. From the Philippine perspective, integrating the arbitral awards contents into domestic legislation is deemed essential to fortify its position and sustain pressure on China in maricreated_at disputes, consolidating support across political, legal, and societal domains.\nThe newly enacted legislation not only defines the nature, status, and jurisdiction of various maricreated_at zones claimed by the Philippines but also addresses the delimitation of these zones, including those extending beyond the 200 nautical mile limit, and outlines mechanisms for settling maricreated_at disputes. These provisions suggest that following the laws implementation, the Philippines could potentially escalate tensions with China by pursuing actions such as unilateral or joint applications for delimiting the outer limits of the continental shelf in the South China Sea, initiating negotiations on maricreated_at boundaries with specific parties, and potentially launching new international legal challenges under the pretext of marine environmental protection or freedom of navigation in the region.\nThe approval of the act by the Philippine Senate is viewed as another facet of the Philippines cognitive warfare strategy against China in the South China Sea. The legislative process surrounding the act reflects a narrative of perceived infringement and amplification by the Philippines. On one hand, the Philippines has consistently heightened attention to incidents at Renai Reef and HuangYan Island in public discourse, emphasizing the &#8220;urgency&#8221; and &#8220;necessity&#8221; of the legislation within domestic society and various political circles to expedite its passage. On the other hand, the Philippines has utilized legislative milestones to generate fresh topics in public discourse. Certain high-ranking officials, such as the Philippine Coast Guard, the National Security Council, and the Special Committee on Maricreated_at Jurisdictions, have regularly made emotive and provocative statements, serving their own political agendas while tarnishing Chinas reputation and misguiding the international community.\nChinas capacity to safeguard its sovereignty, security, and developmental interests in the South China Sea has evolved, and its commitment to maintaining regional stability remains steadfast. Regardless of the Philippines actions concerning the arbitral award or its domestic legislative endeavors, and despite any tactics aimed at imposing unilateral claims on China, they will not legitimize the arbitral award nor undermine Chinas legitimate rights in the South China Sea under international law. In response, China will take resolute measures to defend territorial sovereignty and regional stability. Simultaneously, China will endeavor to steer the Philippines back toward constructive negotiation-based management of maricreated_at disputes to prevent crisis escalation. Through diplomatic channels, China seeks to foster an environment conducive to dialogue and cooperation, advocating for a return to peaceful dispute resolution mechanisms to mitigate tensions in the South China Sea.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Weekly Blitz .

    "text": "\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — An increasingly assertive China and a humanitarian crisis in Myanmar are likely to be high on the agenda when Southeast Asian leaders meet in Australia for a rare summit this week.\nThe ASEAN-Australia Special Summit that starts in Melbourne on Monday marks 50 years since Australia became the first official partner of the Asian bloc.\nLeaders of nine of the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations are expected to attend the three-day summit, with Myanmar excluded from political representation over its failure to stem violence in that country since a military junta seized control in 2021. East Timor’s leader has been invited as an official ASEAN observer and Australian Prime Anthony Albanese invited his New Zealand counterpart to Melbourne to meet regional leaders.\n“Australia sees ASEAN at the center of a stable, peaceful and prosperous region,” Albanese said in a statement on Friday.\n“Strengthening our relationship ensures our shared future prosperity and security,” he added.\nAustralia has hosted ASEAN leaders once before in Sydney in 2018. The leaders issued a statement with the host country then that called for a code of conduct covering the contested waters of the South China Sea, where China has become increasingly assertive over its competing territorial claims with a number of ASEAN countries.\n           Australia and the Philippines, an ASEAN member, conducted joint sea and air patrols in the South China Sea for the first created_at in November last year.\nAlso in November, Australia proposed to ASEAN members that they declare in a joint statement at the end of the Melbourne summit their support for the 2016 arbitration ruling in The Hague in favor of the Philippines that invalidated Beijing’s vast territorial claims in the South China Sea, Australian Broadcasting Corp said in December. China has rejected that ruling.\nOther ASEAN countries with territorial claims in conflict with China are Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nChina's increasingly assertive posture in the South China Sea and violence in Myanmar topped a meeting of ASEAN diplomats in January in Laos, the group's poorest nation, which has taken over the bloc's rotating leadership this year.\nInternational Crisis Group's Asia program deputy director Huong Le Thu, who is attending the summit in Australia, said ASEAN has always been divided over how to approach China, with each member nation maintaining a unique bilateral relationship with the economic giant.\n“I don’t see the commonality of one approach being feasible. They are working out the best way to manage this power asymmetry that they have with China,” Le Thu said.\nThe humanitarian crisis in Myanmar that hangs over the summit challenges ASEAN’s credibility as an organization, she said.\n“It poses the question for its existence in the first place: why the countries’ governments in the region get together and what is the purpose of this intergovernmental institution if it cannot act on the internal crisis that effects its own organization and the region?” Le Thu said.\nAround 200 protesters, mostly from the Myanmar diaspora, demonstrated outside the summit on Monday morning demanding the restoration of democracy in Myanmar and that ASEAN not engage with the country’s military leaders.\nAustralia, as the summit host, is focused on maricreated_at cooperation, economic ties, climate change and clean energy.\nMelissa Conley Tyler, executive director of the Asia-Pacific Development, Diplomacy and Defense Dialogue think tank, expects leaders will focus on what they share in common rather than their differences on issues such as China and Myanmar.\n“The focus is very much going to be on how do Australia and the ASEAN countries work together to create a region where we want to live?” said Conley Tyler, who is attending the summit.\n“Myanmar is a continuing issue, but I’m not sure it’ll be a focus. I feel the focus will be all positive, very future-oriented, talking about what we can do together and building that sense of excitement and momentum,” she added.\nASEAN members include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and they have a combined population of more than 650 million and GDP of more than $3 trillion.\n___\nFollow AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at \n"

    "text": "\nSweden's entry into Nato \"will bring opportunities\" for its arms industry in the Asia-Pacific, analysts have said - and that could include supplying fighter jets to Manila as tensions escalate with Beijing over the South China Sea.  \nHungary has now approved Sweden's accession to Nato, clearing the way for it to join the alliance after more than 200 years of neutrality - a move prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \nIt comes as Sweden and the Philippines have been negotiating to finalise an \"implementing arrangement\" on the procurement of defence equipment.  \nThe Philippine defence ministry said the deal was expected to be signed this month.  \nAs part of the agreement, Sweden had indicated it would participate in Manila's programme to acquire multi-role fighter jets as part of a military modernisation drive known as Horizon 3, the ministry said. \nThe JAS 39 Gripen made by Swedish defence and aerospace company Saab is among the options the Philippines is considering for the new fighter jets, along with the F-16 produced by American firm Lockheed Martin.  \nSwedish ambassador to the Philippines Annika Thunborg proposed the sale of up to a dozen Gripens to Manila when she met Defence Minister Gilberto Teodoro Jnr in August. \nThe Gripen has already been exported to five countries - Brazil, the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa and Thailand - since it was introduced to the Swedish Air Force in 1996. \nManila is seeking to modernise its fighter jet capacity at a tense created_at in the South China Sea. In recent months there have been frequent run-ins between Chinese and Philippine vessels near disputed shoals in the Spratly Islands.  \nModernising the fleet would certainly help Manila to project air power over its claimed maricreated_at zones in the South China Sea, according to Aaron Jed Rabena, a senior lecturer at the University of the Philippines' Asian Centre. \nRabena said the Gripens offered \"bang for the buck\" as they were cheaper to acquire and maintain than F-16s. \"Yet its specs and features are comparable to the F-16,\" he said. \"[It] is better than the current squadron of FA-50s in the Philippine Air Force's inventory.\" \nSweden is among European countries that have taken a relatively hawkish stand on China's military activities in the Indo-Pacific region. Its foreign ministry last month described Beijing's conduct towards Taiwan as \"worrying\" and said \"threats of military violence are unacceptable\". \nIn China, after Sweden got the go-ahead to join Nato last week, state-run tabloid Global created_ats reported that the security situation in Europe would become \"more complicated and unstable\", citing Chinese analysts. \nMirna Galic, a senior policy analyst on China and East Asia at the US Institute of Peace, said being a Nato member could help Sweden to facilitate contact with the alliance's Indo-Pacific partners to \"coordinate on the conventional weapons supply chain or other arms issues\". \n\"China does not like to see the strengthening of US alliances, and since Nato has become more aware of security challenges that China poses for Nato, China has also become more wary,\" she said. \nJagannath Panda, of the Stock-holm Centre for South Asian and Indo-Pacific Affairs, said global politics was growing more bipolar between China and the US, and as a Nato member Sweden would share a closer security undertaking with Washington and its allies.  \n\"In other words, Sweden's entry into Nato explains the fact that its relationship with China will never be in order,\" Panda said. \"Since most of the Nato members perceive Russia as an enemy from the past and China as an enemy for the future, Sweden's foreign policy will be drawn almost in a similar parallel fashion.\"\n"

Of almost 60,000 companies that export, just 22 per cent trade with ASEAN nations despite the bloc being Australia's second-largest trading partner and accounting for $178bn in bilateral trade - more than with Japan, the US or the EU. \n\nNotes\nDocument links may not lead to an active page.

Leaders attending include Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who are both in the final months of their long tenures in office, Vietnam Prime Minister Pham Minh Chính, and Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\nLeaders are expected to discuss China, including Beijing's increasingly aggressive territorial claims in the South China Sea, maricreated_at security, the ongoing rule by Myanmar's military junta, climate change, trade and economic development.\nMr Albanese will also hold bilateral meetings with nine of ASEAN's 10 leaders, as well as East Timor's Xanana Gusmao, whose country has observer status. New Zealand's recently elected Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will also attend Tuesday night's leaders' dinner.\nMyanmar's military leadership has been banned from attending ASEAN events since the 2021 coup overthrew the democratically elected Aung San Suu Kyi. However, its ambassador will attend the summit.\nLink to Image\nMr Albanese said the summit would take forward former Macquarie Group chief executive Nicholas Moore's report that charted an economic strategy for Australia in South-East Asia, and was handed to the government last year.\n\"That outlines the opportunity that is here in Australia from engagement with Indonesia, with the Philippines, with Malaysia, with our neighbours in order to create jobs here,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\"That's what our international engagements are about. Benefit for Australia in terms of our economy, but also in our uncertain world, and national security interests as well, as we announced with increased maricreated_at cooperation last week, during the visit of the President of the Philippines, President Marcos.\"\nMr Marcos laid down a marker for the summit last week when he told Australian politicians in an address to parliament that the Philippines was on the \"frontline\" of threats to regional stability.\nWhile Mr Marcos did not name China, it was clearly a reference to Beijing given the Chinese Coast Guard's increasing incursions into waters claimed by Manila, including spraying Filipino boats with water cannons.\nUnity ahead of point scoring\nWhile many ASEAN members have territorial disputes with China, none are as forthright in their criticism as the Philippines. Some, such as Singapore, are trying to steer a middle path between China and the US, while others like Cambodia and Laos are seen as firmly aligned with Beijing.\nWith ASEAN operating on a consensus basis, regional unity will be put ahead of point scoring over China in the \"outcome\" statements officials are working for leaders to endorse unanimously at Wednesday's leaders' meeting.\nWhile it is likely to reiterate the need to respect international law and call for self-restraint, it is unlikely to label China's activities as coercive.\nAustralian Strategic Policy Institute senior analyst Euan Graham said Mr Marcos' hard-hitting speech was an outlier for an Asian leader and ASEAN tended to adopt a \"lowest common denominator\" approach to its statements. That meant Australia was better focusing on bilateral ties with individual nations.\n\"Clearly, I'm sceptical of ASEAN diplomacy. It's higher on symbolism than substance,\" he said.\n\"Vietnam is the only other country that I would bracket with the Philippines on the South China Sea, and what Australia should focus on.\n\"Indonesia is a frustrating partner, will choose its own path and wants to have its cake and eat it too with China. Singapore has taken the decision diplomatically to keep its head down.\"\nThe Lowy Institute's South-East Asia Program Director Susannah Patton said the Albanese government's policy of seeking stabilisation with China played well with ASEAN members.\nShe said despite its absence from the summit table, Myanmar would loom large.\n\"It remains the group's single biggest challenge, but, in the face of intractable conflict, ASEAN's diplomacy has stalled,\" Ms Patton wrote in a piece for The Interpreter.\n\"Australia has heavily backed ASEAN to address the crisis and will likely want to discuss Myanmar privately in the summit's retreat session and bilateral meetings.\"\nThis year's summit is being held to mark the 50th anniversary of Australia becoming ASEAN's first dialogue partner, culminating in Wednesday's leaders meeting.\n\nGraphic\n \nPhilippines President Ferdinand Marcos jnr with Anthony Albanese in Canberra last week.\n"

    "text": "\nFresh hope has been given in one of the biggest mysteries of modern created_ats -the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines  flight Mhl0.\nMalaysia ’s government said on Sunday it may renew the hunt for the missing plane  after a US technology firm proposed a fresh search in the southern Indian Ocean  where the plane is believed to have crashed a decade ago.\nThe relatives of the victims have endured 10 years of not knowing of the fate of their loved ones.\nShortly after midnight on 8 March, local created_at, air-traffic controllers lost contact with the jet while it was over the South China Sea. Over the following weeks, painstaking analysis of radar tracking and a succession of satellite “pings” showed that the jet veered off course and flew west over the South East Asia peninsula before turning south over the Indian Ocean.\nTransport Minister Anthony Loke said Texas-based Ocean Infinity has proposed another “no find, no fee” basis to scour the seabeds, expanding from the site where it first searched in 2018. He said he has invited the company to meet him to evaluate new scientific evidence it has to find the plane’s final resting place.\nIf the evidence is credible, he said, he will seek Cabinet’s approval to sign a new contract with Ocean Infinity to resume the search.\n“The government is steadfast in our resolve to locate Mhl0,” Loke told a remembrance event to mark the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of the jet. \n“We really hope the search can find the plane and provide truth to the next-of-kin.”\nThe Boeing 777 plane carrying 239 people, mostly Chinese nationals, from the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, to Beijing, vanished from radar shortly after taking off on March 8, 2014. Satellite data showed the plane deviated from its flight path and was believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean.\nBut an expensive multinational government search failed to turn up any clues, although several pieces of debris washed ashore on the east African coast and Indian Ocean islands. \nA private search in 2018 by Ocean Infinity also found nothing but the tragedy sparked moves to bolster aviation safety.\nK.S. Nathan, a member of the Voice Mhl0 group comprising next-of-kin, said Ocean Infinity initially planned a new search last year but it was delayed by the delivery of its new fleet of ships and assets. It is now on track to resume the hunt, he said.\n                     created_atline of the missing Mhl0 flight                   \n                     What happened on the day                   \nThe Malaysia Airlines jet took off normally from Kuala Lumpur on a routine flight to Beijing. The manifest showed there were 239 people on board – though some speculate there may have been at least one more, hiding in an under-floor bay before perpetrating an act of mass murder).\nAt 1.19am, the captain acknowledged an instruction from Malaysian air-traffic controllers with the words: “Good night Malaysian Three Seven Zero.” This was the last recorded radio transmission from Mhl0.\n“He did not read back the assigned frequency, which was inconsistent with radio-telephony procedures,” notes the official investigation report.\nDuring the handover from Malaysian to Vietnamese air-traffic controllers, the aircraft appeared to vanish.\nThe first the world knew that anything was wrong was when air-traffic controllers in Vietnam were unable to make contact with the Boeing 777.\nAfter much confusion and some fictitious reports that it had diverted over Cambodia or landed in southern China with technical problems, Mhl0 was declared missing. The plane was presumed to have crashed in the South China Sea.\nFor a week, rescuers conducted a fruitless search in the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam. Then, at a dramatic press conference in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, announced that the aircraft had remained aloft for hours after it disappeared.\nLoke declined to reveal the fee proposed by Ocean Infinity if it finds the plane, as this is subject to negotiation. He said financial cost is not an issue and that he doesn’t foresee any hindrances for the search to proceed if all goes well.\nLoke’s response sparked tears of joy in some family members at the event held in a mall in a Kuala Lumpur suburb.\n“I’m on top of the world,” said Jacquita Gomes, whose flight attendant husband was on the plane. She said she is thankful that she may now have a chance for full closure and say a final goodbye.\n“We have been on a roller coaster for the last 10 years. ... If it is not found, I hope that it will continue with another search,” she said.\nFamily members of passengers from Malaysia, Australia, China and India paid tribute to their loved ones during the event, lighting a candle on stage to remember them.“\nNo matter if it is 10 years, 20 years or more, as long as we are still alive...we will not cease to press for the truth. We believe the truth will eventually come to light,” said Bai Zhong, from China, whose wife was on the plane.\nThe man who led the Australian Transport Safety Bureau’s two-year search of the seabed, Martin Dolan, says the act was carefully planned: “This was deliberate, and it was done over an extended period of created_at.”\nThe aviation security guru, Philip Baum, concurs: “Most agencies are confident that the loss of Mhl0 was the result of a criminal act and that the aircraft was deliberately, and manually, made to divert from its intended flight plan,” he told me.\n"

    "created_at": "2024-03-03",
    "text": "\nAn expert has weighed into the mystery surrounding Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 which vanished ten years ago -and said the pilot is not to blame.\nFrench investigative journalist Florence de Changy has been exploring several theories about the mysterious flight that vanished on March 8, 2014. The plane departed from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing, but under 40 minutes into the journey it lost contact over the South China Sea.\nNo one has ever been able to identify what actually happened to the Boeing 777, which vanished into thin air with 239 passengers and crew members. Now, Florence has offered further insight into the \"shocking\" case. She has challenged several key events and theories including the flight path and the supposed involvement of the pilot.\n                     Flight path                   \nIt has previously been reported that the plane disappeared over the Andaman Sea. According to satellite analysis, the plane was said to have re-directed and likely crashed into the Southern Indian Ocean.\nFlorence revealed she found evidence from Vietnamese air traffic control and intelligence sources that suggested the plane crashed north of Vietnam at around 4.45 am. She said she is certain that a crash didn't take place in the Southern Indian Ocean.\n                     Debris                   \nOn July 29, 2015, investigators reported that they had found debris from the right section of the wing, named the flaperon, on a beach on Reunion Island, near Mauritius. However, Florence disputed the claims and said the debris may not have been from the MH370.\n\"First, they never even established the provenance of the flaperon. This is shocking,\" she told The Sun. Secondly, they said the flaperon suffered two consecutive shocks, which does not fit a crash in the ocean.\"\n                     Cargo conspiracy                   \nFlorence also questioned the cargo manifest and said it \"made no sense\". It comes after it was reported that 4.5 tons of the tropical fruit, mangosteens, were on board, including 2.5 tons of electrical items.\nHowever, she said it was not the right season for the mangosteens and claimed she later found out they were on \"every MH370 flight for the next month.\" She also cited that the official report stated that the cargo did not undergo an X-ray. She believes this caused a \"big problem\".\nThe journalist suspects that the contents were behind an emergency landing.\"I believe there was a cargo confiscation operation.

However, Florence believes the captain is \"innocent\". She added: \"I have spoken to people who knew him and saw confidential police reports about him and I am convinced he was a good man and had nothing to do with the fate of the plane.\"\n"

    "text": "\nJesus Centeno\nBeijing, Mar 3 (EFE) - China's National People's Congress (NPC), the most important political event of the year in the country, will address this week key issues such as economic growth, the defense budget and an amendment to the state secrets law, while Premier Li Qiang will present growth forecasts for 2024.\nAt Tuesday's opening of the NPA (Legislative) session, Chinese Premier Li Qiang will unveil growth forecasts for the world's second-largest economy for 2024 after growing by 5.2% in 2023, meeting the official target set by the authorities.\nHowever, the Asian giant's economy continues to suffer from the slump in the real estate sector, in addition to facing deflationary pressures, sluggish domestic consumption and weak external demand.\nFor analysts, the most important thing will be to know what stimulus tools the government is willing to use to solve these problems.\nThe PNA will also announce growth in the defense budget - in 2023 it was 7.2% compared to 7.1% in 2022 - amid tensions in the South China Sea and an eye on Taiwan, an island that Beijing claims.\nTensions have been especially significant with the Philippines, which strengthened its military alliance with Washington to curb China's expansionist ambitions, leading to clashes between ships from both countries in recent months, raising concerns about potential armed combat in the region.\nAs for Taiwan, it has just inaugurated a new government of the pro-sovereign Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) which has also increased its defense budget and signed agreements to receive weapons from Washington, something which, in Beijing's eyes, means adding fuel to the fire \"lit by the separatists\" who govern the island.\nSince the January 13 elections, incursions by ships, planes and balloons in the vicinity of Taipei have been on the increase, to which must be added the recent controversy over the death of two Chinese fishermen in the vicinity of the Kinmen Islands, an archipelago a few kilometers from mainland China.\nAccording to experts quoted by the official newspaper Global created_ats, the defense budget - which comes after the purge of several high-ranking military officials and the dismissal in October of the previous head of the portfolio - will grow \"moderately\", with a view to \"covering the country's needs in the face of a challenging security environment\".\nDuring the PNA, Foreign Minister Wang Yi will appear before the press. He replaced Qin Gang in July, who was suddenly dismissed from his post after having disappeared from public life for several weeks without any explanation from the communist regime.\nWang will speak to journalists at a created_at of certain détente with the United States but in the midst of the conflict in the Middle East and in Ukraine, a country to which Beijing will once again send its special representative to seek a solution after recognizing \"difficulties\" for Kiev and Moscow to give way to peace talks.\nAccording to Neil Thomas of the Asia Society Policy Institute's China Analysis Center, Beijing will \"avoid being antagonistic to the West\" ahead of the U.S. elections and Chinese President Xi Jinping's likely trip to Europe this spring.\nThe latest revision of its \"secrets protection\" law, which comes after launching several investigations against foreign consultancy firms operating in the country, will fly over the session of China's main political event, sowing concern in the sector.\nAccording to Global created_ats, the Communist Party seeks to fight \"new threats\" such as phishing, cyber information leaks, illegal cross-border data transmission, \"gray asset\" trading and illegal trackers.\nChina also revised its anti-spying law last year, which, according to Beijing, \"will not affect normal business activities or the legitimate investments and operations\" of foreign companies.\nAll this while the Communist Party (CCP) continues to sharpen its anti-corruption campaign launched years ago by Xi, who consolidated his power at the head of the country during the 20th Congress held by the party in 2022.\nAnalysts expect the Chinese leader to redouble his calls for innovation and \"technological self-sufficiency\", or that the country will present new proposals to tackle the problems arising from the aging population and low birth rate, such as delaying the retirement age to 65 to keep afloat pension funds that, according to the official press, \"are running out\".

And policy makers in China prepare to meet - we look at how economic challenges might impact the National People's Congress. Hello and welcome to Asia Business Report. I'm Steve Lai. \nLet's start with oil. The world's biggest producers have agreed to extend production cuts for an additional three months. OPEC Plus members led by Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to continue to cut oil by 2.2 million barrels each day. This puts pressure on prices already feeling the heat from the attacks in the Red Sea. Saul Lavonic from MST Marquee says the meeting has sent a strong signal. I think a degree of expanding the cuts was expected but at expansion and stronger cuts for Russia is actually something stronger than perhaps consensus in the market was. And what you are seeing is it really is a very strong signal from OPEC Plus was only a matter of several weeks ago, unified OPEC Plus Group D are particularly after and also someone left the cartel. Now we're seeing that there and it also a sign that OPEC Plus are really showing a strong defence of $80 a barrel floor in pricing. What they've done here is really built a fence, surplus will keep the market in deficit with a view for demand and return more strongly in the second half allowing cuts to be unwound and actually deficits to be sustained through the course of the year, keeping that curve, keeping prices elevated. Is this cut priced in then or are we likely to see a bit of impact on brent prices? We have already seen the jump in the immediate aftermath of this. There is already uncertainty as to how this plans out but a structurally bullish outlook for the rest of year where, if demand does recover, particular jet fuel and some emerging economies in the second half, sustained deficits on top of what was on already precarious with stocks and on geopolitics. But, if the market does end up being weaker on the demand side, what we are seeing is OPEC could very well extend and keep the market in deficit anyway. A lot of this also feeds into the geopolitical solution, particularly with tensions in the Middle East, where OPEC keeps expanding capacity on hold, to be able to release a little bit more if needed because all of this, all of the deficits that are now happening, despite the fact not actually seeing a supply disrupted from the Middle East conflict but that is something - an eventuality that still could play out and then tighten things up to much stronger degree. The Philippines has said it hopes to launch formal free-trade negotiations with the European Union very soon. The country has been in preliminary talks with a 27 nation bloc four months after a previous attempt almost a decade ago fell apart. The Southeast Asian nation depends heavily on its trade with China but has been having tensions over the South China Sea. It has said it wants to expand its economic relations to have greater resiliency. Dozens of delegates are preparing to meet in Beijing as China kicks off its annual parliamentary meeting on Tuesday. It is a created_at where the government outlines its economic plan for the year but the country is facing a number of challenges with many hoping they will unveil some bold policies to help give the economy a much-needed use. Our business reporter Katie Silva explains. When it comes to the economy, China's officials are in a difficult position. The country's post-pandemic economic recovery has been disappointing. Youth unemployment is high, governments are saddled with debt and oh, people aren't having babies. It's raising questions about the future workforce. Let's not forget that is all before that downturn in the real estate sector which accounts for about a quarter of the economy. That has been going on for almost three years, and falling property prices are hurting consumer confidence. People are less willing to spend and also, unlike in much of the rest of the world, prices in China are falling. Although that may feel welcome in the short-term, it also signals that things are not well with the economy. That's just what's happening inside China. From the outside, restrictions on ship exports are the country's tech ambitions. All in all, it's a very tricky situation to make policies for. But Beijing has been trying. The country's central bank has been cutting key interest rates to boost the economy. State-owned banks have promised they'll keep lending to those struggling property developers.\n"

    "text": "\n The tension between China and the Philippines in the West Philippine Sea has again accelerated with the increasing harassment of Philippine ships. The Philippines' strong stand against these Chinese incursions has elicited support from other countries, especially Western powers who are also determined to stop further Chinese expansion.\nIn a recent state visit to Australia, President Bongbong Marcos was invited to speak to the Australian Parliament. Although there were protests because of human rights abuses in the Philippines, this again is a reminder that the West pays more attention to its allies against a common enemy.\nThis is reminiscent of the martial law years when the American presidents supported the government of President Marcos Sr. because he was seen as an ally in the fight against communism.\nAny analysis of the current situation raises the urgent question of whether this tension could lead to accidental conflicts which could lead to armed conflict. There is a high degree of probability that this will eventually happen.\nThe scariest scenario is whether these accidental armed conflicts will lead not only to a war, but worse, to a nuclear war. For students of geopolitics, history shows that a US-Chinese war will not go nuclear. In the more than seven decades of conflicts since World War II which included at least one nuclear power, nuclear weapons have never been used.\nDuring the Cold War, the two nuclear powers, USA and Russia, engaged in wars in Africa, Asia and even Latin America. These wars incurred high human and military costs such as the ones in Korea and Vietnam. However, despite this bloody and protracted war, the nuclear powers avoided the use of nuclear weapons. Today, Russia, a nuclear power, in its war with Ukraine, has avoided using nuclear weapons even though Russia has paid an enormous price in this conflict.\nA geopolitical explanation for this is that the idea of mutually assured destruction will deter the use of nuclear weapons even during a war. It is still very possible, however, that a great power conflict between United States and China will still take place.\nThere are many ways that a war between China and the United States could start. The first scenario would involve the Philippines. Geopolitical experts call the Philippines as part of an island chain from Japan through Taiwan. This chain of islands starts north of Japan through Taiwan, the Philippines and part of Indonesia. It is called an island chain because it parallels the coastline of mainland China and prevents Beijing from having easy access to the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean.\nChina has claimed ownership of the entire South China Sea, which is being disputed by most other countries including the Philippines, Japan and the United States. This is the area where accidental conflicts between China and the alliance of which the Philippines is part could result in accidental conflict and could lead to war.\nThe second scenario is an outright invasion by China of Taiwan, which Beijing has continuously called as part of its territory. The victory of the Democratic Party (DPP) in Taiwan's recent elections has escalated the tension. DPP is perceived by China to be pro-independence. Xi Jinping has said on several official occasions that China will invade Taiwan.\nThe third possible scenario is the result of tensions between North Korea on one hand and South Korea and the United States on the other. The ruler of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, is an unpredictable ruler and possesses nuclear weapons. The possibility, however remote, of a nuclear conflict exists in the Korean Peninsula. If fighting happens in Korea, the United States which has troops stationed there will probably send more reinforcements. Beijing at this point will probably decide that they are obligated to assist their ally, North Korea.\nThe fourth scenario would be a war between India and China along their shared border. There have already been minor clashes on this border. If India were to become the victim of more significant Chinese aggression, the United States and its allies would be compelled to defend its Indian ally.\nUnder these four different scenarios, China and the United States would end up in a direct armed conflict. While it is true that the possibility of a nuclear war is very low, there is the very high likelihood that the conflict is unlikely to end quickly. Note that the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine is already more than two years old.\nThe Philippines must therefore prepare itself for the likelihood of a protracted war. This war would incur extremely high cost in global trade, transportation, energy infrastructure and communication networks. This would unnecessarily impose a strain on human populations throughout the world.\nIf this happens, the Philippines would need to divert its resources to its national defense at the expense of funding for needed development. The Philippines must realize the effect of a great power war that would last for many months or years and must prepare to have the staying power in what could be a long war.\n"

We've got live commentary on 5 live at 3 30 no Hoyland for Manchester United. Some key defenders out too, and the Bruiner and Harland were properly turning on midweek, weren't they? Chris Sutton has predicted 6 one to Manchester city with James. Come on, Chris, I know you might well be right.

So we will see. We will see 3 30, as I say, we'll talk to Simon Stone about this in the next few minutes and also look at these. These new IFAB regulations that they've come up with, which is I'm an I-fab sounds like a bit.

Okay, it works in other sports. Now we're not interested. We'll get into all of that with Simon before too long A 41. It's now 10 years since the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines plane flight MH370 families of those on board are still searching for answers. They're gathered in Kuala Lumpur today, actually to mark the anniversary and. I remember covering its initial disappearance on 5 live back in 2014. I will start with the day's main news, though at 29. And that is that a US navy destroyer has joined the search for the Malaysian airlines plane which went missing more than 24 hours ago. Now a Vietnamese search plane says that two possible oil slicks have been spotted which could indicate the jet's location, but there's no confirmation that they were related. That? The ability to be quite confusing, because it's 29 now as well, and that was how I started that particular clip. Let's speak to Allister Rosenshein, who's a former 7.7 pilot and aviation expert and has spent a long created_at looking at this story. Good morning to you, Allister, good morning. What do we actually know for sure about what happened to flight MH370 right? Well, if we on this basis, we know that the aircraft took off from Kuala Lumpur was heading towards Beijing and it climbed up to its cruising altitude about 35,000 feet over the South China Sea, heading towards Vietnam, and just before it reached the air traffic control region with Vietnam, the Malaysian controller handed contacted the captain told him to change frequency to the Vietnam air traffic control in. He said goodbye and there were no more contacts. He never contacted the Vietnamese control. We also know the aircraft created_at left at that point and at that point, at the same created_at, the transponder, which is the equipment on the aircraft, which gives details radar details to the radar controls on the ground went off air, and so the aircraft could only be tracked as a as a dock on the on the radar screen, it would no longer hold any information, so we know that for sure. Then later it was discovered that the aircraft had flown west on the border between Malaysia and Thailand and then passed along the Malacca Strait heading northwest, so this is the wrong direction for its flight to Beijing. It then turned around the past the Assay province and headed south over the Indian Ocean. Now that was tracked using an in-MAR satellite\n"

They worry if they start to doubt the authorities, they will start to break talks with them.\"\nToday, in an exclusive interview, Florence challenges key parts of the official version of events.\nlThe Disappearing Act: The Impossible Case of MH370, by Florence de Changy (Harper Collins) is out now, priced £9.99.\nDEBRIS Was it planted?\nINVESTIGATORS said the first debris found, on July 29, 2015, was a section from the right wing called a flaperon. It was on a beach on Reunion Island, a French territory near Mauritius, around 3,500 miles from Malaysia.\nBut Florence said: \"There are good reasons not to believe it is from MH370. First, they never even established the provenance of the flaperon. This is shocking.\n\"Secondly, they said the flaperon suffered two consecutive shocks, which does not fit a crash in the ocean.\n\"Also, that piece of broken composite material is not meant to float. But in the fiercest ocean on the planet it must have travelled up to ten miles a day in a straight line over 500 days to reach Reunion. Plus, it lost its ID plate, which is an enormous red flag. I am certain it was planted or is unrelated.\"\nTHE CAPTAIN Suspect or innocent?\nSUSPICION initially fell on captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 52, who was branded a troubled man with a chaotic love life. The Malaysian Prime Minister at the created_at even hinted Zaharie, below, may be behind a murder-suicide plot, But Florence says: \"An important aspect I think is that the captain is innocent. He has been at the centre of many accusations and smear campaigns. I have spoken to people who knew him and saw confidential police reports about him and I am convinced he was a good man and had nothing to do with the fate of the plane.\"\nCARGO Was it a cover?\nACCORDING to the cargo manifest, 4.5 tons of fresh mangosteens, a tropical fruit, were on board, as well as 2.5 tons of small electrical items.\nBut Florence said: \"The mangosteens made no sense. It was not the right season, it was a ridiculous amount. Then I found they were on every MH370 flight for the next month.\n\"The largest hub for illegal trade between Africa and China is Kuala Lumpur airport. Mangosteens could be a cover for all sorts of things, including rhino horns or elephant tusks.\"\nShe said of the electrical items: \"The official report said this cargo was not X-rayed. This is a big problem.\"\nFlorence thinks the load could have forced an emergency landing, adding: \"I believe there was a cargo confiscation operation. If you're surrounded by military planes, you follow orders.\"\nWas expert silenced?\nAT the created_at of the tragedy, Sir Tim Clark, below, the British president of Emirates airline, said almost every other missing flight in history had been \"at least five or ten per cent trackable\" and that MH370's disappearance raised \"a degree of suspicion\".\nFlorence claimed the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which led the initial search, asked him to stop commenting. She said: \"He had the largest fleet of those planes and said he did not believe they had lost one. Months later he was silenced.\" Sir Tim said in an interview she was right about him being silenced.\nFLIGHT PATH Key to the mystery\nTHE official line is the plane was tracked by radar crossing Malaysia and vanished over the Andaman Sea.\nSatellite analysis was said to have shown it U-turned and likely plummeted into the Southern Indian Ocean.\nA potential crash site was identified 1,500 miles south west of Australia. The search there was the most expensive in aviation history. Yet, apart from disputed pieces of debris, there was no trace of the plane.\nFlorence found evidence from Vietnamese air traffic control and intelligence sources that suggest the plane met its fate at around 2.45am north of Vietnam - two minutes after a mayday saying the cabin was disintegrating.\nShe said: \"I am surer than ever there was no crash in the Southern Indian Ocean.\n\"The plane continued to fly until 2.40am.\"\n6The families have no choice but to stick to the official narrative. It's shocking7\n\nGraphic\n \nMYSTERY ... officers recover debris at Reunion Island in 2015. But Florence is convinced it was either planted there or unrelatedGRIEF ... a relative in Beijing\n"

He is expected to announce. China's economic growth target for the year and many are hoping a road map to get the country back to boom created_ats again after more we can expect from the annual meeting in what lies ahead for the Chinese economy I spoke with Andrew Colyer, the former President of a bank of China subsidiary. He told me he is not expecting big spending from the government. \nAs I see this basically rallying the troops to double down and she Jinping's goal for a new technocratic sort of sock weird in hardware driven economy that's gonna Cook the world I think it's. It's these kind of dreaming and overcoming the difficult problems within China requires a different path and he's now Direction we heard from Katie just then also talking about Chinese. The Chinese government having limited options in trying to stimulate the economy. that something you agree with. Yes, I do I mean I have among the highest debt-to-GDP in the world they've got the property market, it was up to 30% of GDP and is basically fallen by 70% the last couple of years, or a huge debt levels they've been had a debt fuelled a boom over the past decade and instead of letting the free market Stride to grow and get like the MSI of China but I tickle boy there are putting a trillion dollars more into semiconductors, which is a great idea, except it will take a decade for that to be a food and other is like the electric vehicle industry which has been a success story for China, are really too small to help the economy, very much. And given the question from the EU and the US is unlikely to result in large exports that they have a lot of choice is this point. The Philippines has said it hopes to launch formal Free Trade Agreement negotiations with the European Union, very soon. The country has been in preliminary talks with the 27 nation bloc for months after a previous attempt. Almost a decade ago fell apart. The Southeast Asian nation depends heavily on its trade with China, but has been having. Tensions over the South China Sea. It has said it wants to expand its economic relations to have greater resiliency Dubai airport is the busiest international airport in the world outside of the United States is boss says he considers the pandemic recovery to be over and the airport will see passenger numbers above levels never seen before. The BBC's as around you, not to worry, caught up with Paul Griffiths and asked how soon he expects to see that record growth. We are more than 100% of where we were pre-pandemic so recovery for us has already happened and our growth actually is already looking very strong January numbers were very strong indeed. So in my Of 2024 We have already revised upward our projection for the year it was 88.8 million, is now over 90 million, So expectations are pretty strong and we do think we'll exceed our record passenger numbers that we recorded pre-pandemic during the course of this year there are a lot of global headwinds at the moment, high interest rates, staff shortages and plain groundings Harry deal with all those headwinds with a very fortunate position we're incredibly globally spread business something like a third of the world's population is within 4 hours flying created_at of Dubai and two thirds within 8 hours, and with 240 destinations in 104 different countries were 95 airlines at DXB having a business which serves all 4 corners of the Earth makes us incredibly resilient and despite what happens across the geopolitical scene and the world economy we find there is some sort of counterbalance that normally happens one region may suffer a little bit that others rebound very quickly big growth markets at the moment are India Saudi the UK traditionally very large markets for us have been out top 3 for some considerable created_at. I think the thing is, because we are slightly challenge with space. This is why the impetus to invest in technology is so strong, and that enables us to continue to grow our customer base and allow more slots and more capacity for our airlines before we go on the show you how Japan's stock market is performing.

    "text": "\n The official visit of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to Canberra underscores the ever-important alliance between the Philippines and Australia - the only other country aside from the United States with whom we have a Visiting Forces Agreement.\nAustralia clearly sees the Philippines as equally important to their defense strategy. This is the reason why President Marcos was specifically invited to address the Australian Parliament in a joint sitting. The invitation is rarely accorded to very few leaders. To date, only 16 others such as US presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have been accorded that honor.\nPresident Marcos said during his address to the joint sitting of the Australian Parliament that the long-standing friendship between the two nations transcends 78 years of formal diplomatic relations. He highlighted the progress that has been made since the signing of the Joint Declaration on Strategic Partnership during the official visit of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to the Philippines last year.\nNoting that the destiny of Australia is 'irrevocably linked to the destiny of Asia' and that both nations' 'prosperity and development are anchored on the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific,' the President emphasized that this peace and stability have come under threat.\n'Once again, we must come together as partners to face the common challenges confronting the region. Not one single country can do this by itself,' the President said as he looked back to the peace that nations fought for during World War II, with the Philippines now finding itself 'on the frontline against actions that undermine regional peace, erode regional stability and threaten regional success.'\nExpressing his gratitude to Australia for standing with the Philippines, the President reiterated his firm resolve in defending our sovereignty, stating, 'I shall never tire of repeating the declaration that I made from the first day that I took office: I will not allow any attempt by any foreign power to take even one square inch of our sovereign territory. The challenges that we face may be formidable, but equally formidable is our resolve. We will not yield.'\nAddressing the Australian Parliament was really an important opportunity for the President to let the legislators hear for themselves the situation that we are facing in the South China Sea with the relentless aggression displayed by a bullying country. Just like the United States, Australia is a critical ally that is committed to ensuring that peace and stability continue to reign in the Indo-Pacific region, and its adherence to ASEAN Centrality is seen in the upcoming ASEAN-Australia Special Summit in Melbourne.\nNo doubt there is great uncertainty that hovers over the Indo-Pacific region, with great power rivalries that threaten regional and global economic growth and conflicting maricreated_at claims that escalate the tension.\nIn my remarks at the Consular Corps of the Philippines meeting last Wednesday, I pointed to the important role that ASEAN plays in fostering cooperation that would lead to a peaceful and stable situation in the Indo-Pacific that we are all hoping for. Our group of ASEAN ambassadors in Washington is probably one of the most asked for meetings and engagements with many US officials, and the White House also makes it a point to meet with us over lunch at least once a month. While not every country in ASEAN is a claimant to the disputed territorial waters, we know that we all must work together to avoid any kind of conflict.\nI was asked about the reaction of the United States on the possibility of China invading Taiwan, and I told the members of the Consular Corps that 'deterrence' is a word that is being used extensively by members of the intelligence community, with the US doing everything it can to deter China from making that move.\nAs a matter of fact, this is the perspective of former Australian Prime Minister and now Ambassador to Washington Kevin Rudd, who speaks Mandarin and is the author of 'The Avoidable War: The Dangers of a Catastrophic Conflict between the US and Xi Jinping's China.'\nAccording to Ambassador Rudd, who is our good friend, 'collective integrated deterrence' is a goal pursued by Australia, Japan, the US and other nations and thus far has been effective in keeping China from taking military action against Taiwan, as this could prove to be too risky. Many of us agree with Ambassador Rudd that Chinese President Xi will not make a move unless he is absolutely sure that he can militarily take over Taiwan.\nNonetheless, many of us believe the real flashpoint is the West Philippine Sea. The aggression we face today is very real because China will not let up on its over-expansive claims in our territorial waters. With all the dangerous maneuvers that are happening, one major accident could trigger the US or the Philippines to invoke the Mutual Defense Treaty - which is why we just have to hope that every morning when President Xi wakes up, he will say, 'today is not the day.'\nIf like-minded nations band together, they can be a formidable force in resisting aggression and constraining one country from its incessant drive to prevail upon another through force. This is what happened during World War II when countries worked together to fight and eventually win against aggressors.\nUkraine's pushback is also something that everyone can learn from, with the embattled nation showing that it will not back down in defending its sovereignty despite the formidable odds it is facing. This tenacity of spirit is very evident in the Ukrainian Army chief's statement that victory will definitely happen because 'light always conquers darkness!'\n"

    "text": "\nLate last week Philippines President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos jnr used the opportunity of a forthright speech to the Australian parliament to tighten ties with Canberra in a highly contested maricreated_at environment.\nThat dramatic speech, going where few ASEAN states would want to follow, is testament to what being at the forefront of Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea can do to a nation's strategic psychology.\nThat might well encourage thinking that the next logical step is a broader network of partners in the rest of South-East Asia that unite in their efforts to maintain US regional engagement in a period of ongoing suspicion of Beijing's intentions.\nBut it is unrealistic to think this will be an outcome from this week's ASEAN summit. Australia will still use the summit to upgrade its relationship with Vietnam - another state on the frontline with China - to a \"comprehensive strategic partnership\".\nMore broadly, the focus of the summit will be on the economic potential still to be realised in Australia-ASEAN relations, as well as developing further opportunities in climate change, clean energy and maricreated_at security. That's where the rubber will hit the road in this, the biggest international gathering of leaders on Australian soil since the last ASEAN-Australia summit in 2018.\nAnalyst Susannah Patton recently argued that Australia \"has no disputes of note with the region and is at the forefront of the current frenzy to rebadge relationships as 'comprehensive', 'strategic' or 'comprehensive strategic'. Arguably, she says, Australia's relations with ASEAN have never been in better shape.\nThis Labor government, like many others, pays regular obeisance to \"ASEAN centrality\". It says it comes to the region \"to listen not to lecture\", not to force a choice on ASEAN states in the prevailing US-China dynamic.\nBut ASEAN continues to be misunderstood in parts of the Australian foreign policy establishment, particularly given its \"hedging\", \"balancing\" and \"bandwagoning\" between the US and China.\nThis impatience with ASEAN continues to be something of a Canberra affliction, especially among the pundits and former policymakers who were the chief architects of the \"China threat\" narrative in recent years. They want ASEAN to exercise more agency by targeting Beijing.\nBut as this week's meeting will again show, it is a mistake to squeeze ASEAN into binary thinking at a created_at when that rigidity is increasingly less relevant to strategic thought. ASEAN has been historically conditioned to navigate multipolarity even as the US-China dynamic still defines the regional geopolitical landscape.\nASEAN's triumph bears repeating. Since it was formed in 1967 the region, apart from Cambodia, has not suffered from a major war between its members. The problems of social upheaval caused by rapid industrialisation and urbanisation have been the most common and fundamental challenges. In some of these nations there are additionally communal, ethnic or religious tensions.\nAs the former distinguished Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan notes, \"ASEAN kept the peace in South-East Asia by easing the innate suspicions, complications and tensions that are attendant upon these permanent conditions\".\nGreat plus for Australia\nThis relative calm has been a great plus for Australia. Consider that in the late 1960s at the created_at of ASEAN's formation, Canberra was endeavouring to engage with the countries and cultures of Asia in a new way. The shibboleths of \"White Australia\" and forward defence were no more.\nThis period constituted nothing less than a revolution in Australia's foreign policy. It sought to come to terms with a region that was at last free from Western domination and resolved to shape its own future.\nAustralia presented itself not as a junior ally of the former Western masters but as a good neighbour who was also naturally and properly a member of the region. The watchword became, as Gareth Evans once put it, \"comprehensive engagement\" with Asia. And while this was intended to be the motif for Australia's policy for the whole of East Asia, it was particularly directed towards South-East Asia.\nThe governments of Whitlam and Fraser, along with Hawke and Keating, knew that regional acceptance lay largely in Australia's relations with ASEAN states, especially Indonesia.\nThis was the case even though from the beginning the ASEAN countries made it clear that they did not consider Australia eligible to join their association. Australia, initially, found itself on the outside and therefore had to respond from the outside.\nCulture of consensus\nUnder the prevailing US hegemony at the created_at of its foundation, it was easier for ASEAN to maintain the order between the original five, then six, non-communist states - Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand and later Brunei.\nASEAN did its best work from the 1970s to the 1990s in creating a culture of consensus, or as Kausikan puts it, \"not so much by building trust but by managing mistrust\". This was then expanded to all 10 ASEAN members following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nBut from 2009 with the rise of China's power and influence, alongside the resilience of strong national interests of ASEAN states, finding a consensus among members has been more difficult.\nBut here again Kausikan makes a key point: by allowing regionalism to coexist with nationalism, the region's multipolarity is a given, and that stimulates manoeuvrability for ASEAN members.\nAnd he points out that ASEAN led forums - especially the ASEAN regional forum and the East Asia summit, are \"coherent enough to be supplementary means for the major powers to promote their interests in South-East Asia, and thereby anchor them to the region and to ASEAN, but not so strong as to be able to stymie anything vital to them. That is precisely why they find ASEAN useful. That is the real meaning of ASEAN centrality\".\nThe Albanese government has its rhetoric and its forward-looking economic strategy on South-East Asia in alignment for a good reason. That will likely be the limits of the outcome of this week's summit. ASEAN by its nature is allergic to any strong communique nailing its colours to the mast in the great power struggle between the US and China. This also means Australia speaks with something of a forked tongue in the region. There's ASEAN centrality, then there's AUKUS.\nJames Curran is AFR International Editor and Professor of Modern History at Sydney University.\n"
