    "text": "\nRivals in the South China Sea developing artificial islands to back up their claims have destroyed nearly 7,000 acres (28.3 km2) of coral reefs, the Asia Maricreated_at Transparency Initiative, or AMTI, said.\nThe total area increased 800 acres (3.2 square kilometers) from 6,200 acres (25 square km) at the end of 2023.\nChina has caused the most reef destruction, having buried roughly 4,648 acres (18.8 square km) of reef since 2013, AMTI said in a new report, adding that Vietnam came in second with approximately 2,362 acres (9.5 square km) of reef, mostly in 2024.\nChina and Vietnam are responsible for 65% and 33% of reef destruction, respectively, it said.\nGovernment agencies in the two countries were not available for comment during the Lunar New Year holiday.\nThe think tank affiliated to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington analyzed island building activities of rival claimants, including China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and the Philippines, using commercial satellite imagery.\nIt said that dredging and landfill had caused irreparable damage to the marine habitat, as well as long-term changes to the overall structure and health of reefs in the South China Sea.\nMalaysia, Taiwan and the Philippines accounted for less than 3% of the damage.\nIn a December 2023 report, AMTI said that besides island building, giant clam harvesting by Chinese fishermen also damaged another 16,353 acres (66.1 square km) of coral reef.\nAccording to AMTI, Manila planned to initiate a second legal challenge against Beijing over environmental destruction in what it calls the West Philippine Sea, or part of the South China Sea within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, where it has jurisdiction over natural resources in the water and the seabed.\nThe Marcos administration, however, has yet to decide on a venue for the lawsuit.\nPre-emptive counter strike\nIn 2016, the Philippines won an arbitration case against China under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, but Beijing refused to acknowledge the ruling.\nAMTI's director, Greg Poling, suggested that Manila could file with the U.N. General Assembly a resolution demanding compliance with the 2016 arbitration, and another resolution seeking an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on issues such as whether China's behavior violates international treaties.\nAs with the first case, the Philippines would have to rely mostly on its own efforts as the ASEAN grouping's non-interference principle would prevent other countries in the region from intervening, said Philippine maricreated_at legal expert Jay Batongbacal.\nFor its part, China seemed to have been trying to counter the Philippines' complaints against their environmentally damaging activities since last year, the expert told Radio Free Asia.\nChina's coast guard held a special maricreated_at law enforcement briefing on Sunday, during which it accused other claimant countries of damaging the ecosystems in the South China Sea while praising its own efforts to protect the environment.\nSuch public briefings could serve as a pre-emptive counter strike against Manila's plan, Batongbacal said.\nChina Coast Guard' spokesperson Liu Dejun said in an interview with the Global created_ats newspaper that in 2024 Chinese law enforcement cracked down on illegal fishing, illegal waste disposal and hunting of precious and endangered wildlife, detaining more than 500 foreign vessels for various violations and confiscating 15 of them.\nA foreign fishing vessel was caught poaching coral, with more than 1,200 live coral specimens and large quantities of giant clam shells seized, Liu said without identifying the country that the ship came from.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "title": "Can Malaysia unite ASEAN in the South China Sea?; Whatever its strategy to manage the South China Sea dispute this year, Malaysian officials will need to devote attention to rebuilding trust among the ASEAN claimants, says Malaysian academic Thomas Daniel.",
    "created_at": "2025-02-03",
    "text": "\n                        As Malaysia chairs ASEAN this year, there are several difficult strategic-security issues that it is expected to address and mitigate. Almost all of them are legacy issues, stretching back years or even decades, with the South China Sea (SCS) dispute being of the most complicated and prominent. In fact, this dispute takes on added importance for Malaysia as one of the four ASEAN claimant states. \n                        However, it is not the disputes between the four members of ASEAN that generates titles but that of China’s claims and actions in the dispute. As a regional superpower that holds undisputed escalation dominance in the SCS, and has not been afraid to employ it, China has been strident on its expansive yet undefined claims. In recent years, China has worked to normalise the presence of its ships and aircraft in almost all areas of the SCS, including as far as the Natunas where it postulates overlapping claims with Indonesia. \n                        The fear that the SCS dispute will be subsumed by major power rivalry is one that resonates with most ASEAN member states, including Malaysia.\n                        The impact of great power rivalry\n                        Simmering tensions are manifested most acutely in the dispute over the Philippines’ attempt over the past year to resupply and reinforce its troops stationed at Second Thomas Shoal, a move opposed by China. The resulting highly publicised actions by both countries have seen aggressive maricreated_at manoeuvres, water cannon skirmishes, a severed finger and a “provisional arrangement” cobbled together after urgent diplomacy. It has increased worries among all stakeholders of a conflict, accidental or otherwise, that could draw in external powers like the US, a treaty ally of the Philippines. \n                        The nine-dash line shows China’s historical territorial claim in the South China Sea.\n                        The fear that the SCS dispute will be subsumed by major power rivalry is one that resonates with most ASEAN member states, including Malaysia. Actions like freedom of navigation and overflight exercises by the US and others, have a mixed reception in Southeast Asia due partly to the belief that China has used these to justify the militarisation of the reclaimed features it occupies. For much of 2024, the Biden administration repeatedly issued statements in support of the Philippines, while forward deploying naval units to support their treaty ally. The new Trump administration, which appears to be dominated by China hawks, has reassured the Philippines of its “ironclad” support, while criticising China. \n                        Trust among ASEAN countries a factor\n                        The possibility of the US choosing to increase pressure on China in the SCS as part of a wider strategy to renegotiate a new modus vivendi with China should not be ruled out. ASEAN member states would certainly feel the repercussions from that, which is another consideration for Malaysia in how it approaches the dispute. \n                        That said, a fundamental intra-ASEAN dynamic that the regional association and its Chair will have to navigate is the issue of trust, or the lack thereof. ASEAN member states, and claimant states in particular, simply do not trust each other due their own history of disputes, which predate China’s involvement. There are also more contemporary issues at play. \n                        While Anwar might have more friendly rhetoric when it comes to the bilateral relationship, there is no real evidence of a shift in the country’s SCS policy.\n                        Over the past year, for example, several analytical pieces on Malaysian foreign policy under Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim have speculated about a growing alignment with China, one that he has repeatedly denied. While PM Anwar has repeatedly stressed that Malaysia has no major problems with China in the SCS, he has equally stressed that Malaysia will continue to uphold its interests in the SCS, especially in hydrocarbon exploration, and that the dispute needs to be solved peacefully in line with established international laws, especially UNCLOS. \n                        This has been a longstanding position of Malaysia, which has always sought to compartmentalise the dispute, so it would not affect the wider relationship. Beijing reciprocates this. While Anwar might have more friendly rhetoric when it comes to the bilateral relationship, there is no real evidence of a shift in the country’s SCS policy. \n                        Chinese President Xi Jinping meets Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, on 7 November 2024.\n                        Meanwhile, the perception by some in ASEAN that the Philippines under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr is too close to the US, hence drawing a particularly aggressive response from China on Second Thomas Shoal is an issue that stakeholders from Manila have had to respond to. While some dismiss this as a narrative propagated by China to diminish the agency of the Philippines, the nature of the security partnership between the latter and the US certainly feeds into the speculation which many officials do not openly discuss, with some exceptions. All ASEAN member states have been constant in their desire that both the Philippines and China find a more constructive way to manage the dispute. \n                        One thing is clear, whatever its strategy to manage the SCS dispute this year, Malaysian officials will need to devote attention to rebuilding trust among the ASEAN claimants. This might entail closer and more honest discussions among ASEAN claimants, and more empathy, leading to thoughtful language and framing from all ASEAN parties.  \n                        Black swan risks in South China Sea dispute\n                        Some might argue whether Malaysia is well placed to do this, but Malaysia has little choice. A fractious SCS does not benefit any of its littoral or claimant states, especially a state like Malaysia that is dependent on maricreated_at trade, hydrocarbon resources from the SCS. Don’t forget, Malaysia is also a non-contiguous state, physically separated by the SCS.  \n                        Additionally, Malaysia also has the role of ASEAN’s country coordinator for China until 2027, and thus, the onus on managing the Code of Conduct negotiations between ASEAN and China. Negotiations are now in the third reading of the single draft negotiating text, yet it remains to be seen if the targeted conclusion in 2026 would be achieved. A key consideration would be the final provisions and redress mechanisms in the code meant to govern behaviour in the SCS and minimise tensions. Fear among some observers in ASEAN member states that the Code might ultimately limit their leverage. \n                        An ASEAN member’s stint as chair will be judged on how it manages the difficult, high-profile challenges, somecreated_ats more than its other achievements. It is manifestly unfair, but perceptions do matter. \n                        Chinese Coast Guard vessels fire water cannons towards a Philippine resupply vessel Unaizah May 4 on its way to a resupply mission at Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea, on 5 March 2024.\n                        As with all country coordinators before it, Malaysia will strike an optimistic tone and seek to push the negotiations along. But it is cognisant that it would require an agreement of all member states. While the recent chair’s statement from the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Retreat held in Langkawi did not defer much from ASEAN’s usual language on the SCS, there were repeated mentions of UNCLOS as a universally recognised legal framework in which any and all maricreated_at activities, disputes and outcomes, including the Code of Conduct, must be based on. \n                        All signs are that Malaysian officials are reasonably confident when it comes to managing the dispute as they commence the rotational role of ASEAN chair for 2025. While it is not business as usual, Malaysia’s consistent position on its national and regional interests are not expected to create many waves. \n                        It will be in elements of the dispute that Malaysia has no control over — the dynamics between Philippines and China, whether Beijing suddenly decides to dial up pressure on all claimants, or perhaps even in how the US and other external stakeholders chooses to approach the SCS — which is where possible black swan development will come from. \n                        An ASEAN member’s stint as chair will be judged on how it manages the difficult, high-profile challenges, somecreated_ats more than its other achievements. It is manifestly unfair, but perceptions do matter. Malaysian officials know this and know that no small amount of deft diplomacy is needed as chair of ASEAN in 2025. \n                        Related: The South China Sea in 2025: More of the same, possibly worse | Typhon missile system: Philippines strengthens stance on South China Sea | [Big read] Malaysia leads ASEAN: Will Anwar deliver?\n                        This handout photo taken on 11 January 2025 and released on 12 January by the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) shows a Chinese Coast Guard ship sailing some 60 nautical miles (111 kilometres, 69 miles) west of the main Philippine island of Luzon while being monitored by Philipine Coast Guard ship BRP Teresa Magbanua (not pictured).\n"

    "text": "\nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) has carried out combat readiness patrols in waters and airspace surrounding a ­disputed South China Sea shoal, the latest in a series of exercises to reinforce its control of the area. \nThe PLA's Southern Theatre Command said on Saturday, the day after the latest exercise, it had been stepping up naval and air patrols around Scarborough Shoal - known as Huangyan Island in China - since January, strengthening its maricreated_at and airspace control and management in the area. \n\"[These efforts are aimed at] resolutely safeguarding China's national sovereignty and security, and maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea,\" it said.  \nScarborough Shoal is a group of tiny, low-lying rocky islets in waters claimed and controlled by China. But the shoal lies within the Philippines' 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and is also claimed by Manila, which calls it Panatag Shoal. \nOn Friday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr said China should respect the country's sovereign rights and jurisdiction, and stop its \"aggressive and coercive\" behaviour in the West Philippine Sea - Manila's name for South China Sea waters that lie within its EEZ. \nThe shoal is a source of tensions between the two countries, with Manila protesting last month over what it described as the \"continued illegal presence and operations\" of Chinese coastguards.  \nIt is one of several South China Sea islets and reefs contested by Manila and Beijing. The disputed features also include Second Thomas Shoal and Sabina Shoal. \nThe two countries have also been at odds over the US ­military's deployment of the Typhon missile system in northern Philippines since April.  \nThe deployment has alarmed Beijing because the system covers not only the South China Sea but also the Taiwan Strait. \nThe US and the Philippines are long-created_at treaty allies. They claimed the aim of the Typhon deployment was to support training for joint combat readiness. \nBeijing has demanded Manila remove the missile system, saying it was \"inciting geopolitical ­confrontation and an arms race\". \nIn a video posted on January 19, Yuyuan Tantian, a social media account affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV, said the PLA's combat readiness patrols in the South China Sea had become routine. \nIt said the PLA had deployed many types of aircraft in its patrols around Scarborough Shoal, ­indicating China's control over the South China Sea airspace was becoming \"more systematised\". \nIt said bombers faced a high risk of interception and could not operate independently, making fighter jets essential in providing cover in the waters, while airdrops by transport aircraft was crucial in sustaining frontline troops for prolonged operations. \nIt added these activities would improve the PLA's overall combat strength and demonstrate China's determination to uphold its sovereignty in the disputed waters.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) on Sunday said it had deployed an aircraft to check the “illegal presence” of two Chinese vessels 63 kilometers from the coast of Pangasinan province facing the South China Sea in the country’s north.\nIn a statement, the PCG said its Islander aircraft confirmed the presence of the China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels with bow numbers 3301 and 3104 at 9:30 am on Sunday.\n“Notably, the CCG vessels did not respond to the radio challenge issued by the PCG,” it added.\nIt said two 44-meter PCG vessels — BRP Cabra and BRP Bagacay — were dispatched to Bolinao, Pangasinan, “to address the illegal presence of the China Coast Guard.”\nThe vessels reinforce the Philippine government’s position against the “normalization of illegal patrols” by China within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea.\nOn Saturday night, the Philippine Coast Guard said BRP Teresa Magbanua had “successfully maneuvered” to drive CCG 3304 further away from the Zambales coastline.\nThis prompted China to replace CCG 3304 with CCG 5901, China’s “monster” ship, the PCG said.\n“The crew aboard BRP Teresa Magbanua demonstrated remarkable courage and resolve, remaining undeterred by the presence of the massive CCG 5901,” it said.\nBRP Teresa Magbanua, the Philippines’ biggest coast guard ship, can displace 2,265 tons of water, compared with 12,000 tons for China Coast Guard ship 5901, the largest coast guard cutter in the world.\nThe PCG said the actions of the Chinese vessels are illegal violate the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to which China is a signatory.\n“The PCG reaffirms its commitment to the President and the Filipino people, ensuring that our dedicated personnel will continue to protect Filipino fishermen, uphold our maricreated_at rights, enforce international law and work towards the de-escalation of tensions,” it said.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard last week said its biggest ship had been issuing hourly radio challenges to CCG 3304 near the Zambales coast.\nThe Philippines has accused China of intimidating Filipino fishermen near Scarborough Shoal and normalizing its “illegal presence” after Beijing sent the monster ship into its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) on Jan. 4.\nChina, which claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, has repeatedly accused Philippine vessels of encroachment on its territory. Bilateral ties are at their worst in years after repeated confrontations and heated diplomatic rows.\nA United Nations-backed court in the Hague voided China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea in 2016, as it ruled the shoal is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen.\nTeresa Magbanua replaced the 44-meter vessel BRP Cabra, which arrived at Subic Port on Jan. 28 to unload the text of a Filipino fisherman that it recovered a day earlier.\nThe PCG on Monday night accused China Coast Guard 3304 of shadowing its ship that was rescuing the fisherman’s fishing boat. It said BRP Cabra navigated through heavy waves to retrieve the text using its crane.\nTensions between the two nations have worsened in the past year, with Manila accusing Beijing last month of using a long-range acoustic device (LRAD) against its vessel near the Zambales coast.\nDuring their 10th consultation, representatives from both sides agreed to continue the conduct of rotation and resupply missions to Second Thomas Shoal and sustain the de-escalation of tensions in the area, the Department of Foreign Affairs said last month.\nThe Philippines grounded BRP Sierra Madre, a Word War II-era vessel, at the disputed shoal in 1999 to assert its sovereignty.\n"

China had even transferred nuclear and ballistic missiles to Pakistan and submarines to Myanmar, Bangladesh and others, thus impinging on Indian security,\" said Kondapalli.\n\"At that created_at, China mentioned that it is a deal between two sovereign countries, hence now [China] should not have any anger on Indian sales to Southeast Asia or any other country. India also is aware that it is trying to normalize relations with China,\" he added.\nIndia's Defense Ministry and Foreign Office declined to comment on the specifics of the missile deal.\nIndia's balancing act\nSince October, India and China have engaged in a series of confidence-building measures aimed at normalizing their bilateral relations, which had been strained due to border disputes and geopolitical tensions.\nThis renewed engagement follows a significant meeting between Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the October 2024 BRICS Summit in the Russian city of Kazan.\nBoth countries have moved forward to stabilize ties by agreeing to resume direct air services, start pilgrimages and increase cross-border trade.\nThe effort began after both sides pulled back their troops from two face-off points on their contested high-altitude border following border clashes in 2020, which resulted in the deaths of at lease 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops.\nKondapalli pointed out that by arming Indonesia, India is signaling that its engagement with China will not come at the cost of its Indo-Pacific commitments.\n\"The sale of the BrahMos is related to creating a balance of power in Southeast Asia as China is militarizing the region to the exclusion of other countries,\" he said.\nManaging tensions in the South China Sea\nAlka Acharya, honorary director of the Institute of Chinese Studies in New Delhi, said the missile sale has been on the cards for a very long created_at and has prompted criticism from some Chinese commentators.\n\"This is not a new offer so that it could be linked to current tensions. But obviously, it will not go unnoticed or disregarded, and the Chinese official response would certainly state their objections strongly — especially with how this would destabilize the region and help outside powers who are inimical to China,\" Acharya told DW.\n\"However, the Indian position should be that this is not intended against any third country and is for the legitimate defense of Indonesia. It is not likely to derail the normalization process between India and China,\" she added.\nDeterrence without confrontation\nIndia and Indonesia are concerned about the increased muscle-flexing by a rising China, prompting analysts to argue that the \"China factor\" provides a strong basis for bilateral security cooperation.\nIndonesia has had repeated confrontations with China over the Natuna Islands, which lie within its exclusive economic zone. But they are also claimed by China, and Chinese fishing vessels and coast guard ships have entered the zone.\nIn a few weeks, a high-level Indonesian defense delegation is expected to visit India to continue discussions on defense cooperation.\nPhilippines denounces China's aggressive behaviour in the South China Sea\nAnil Wadhwa, a former Indian diplomat, said this trend of diversifying defense partnerships away from traditional reliance on China should not be seen as an encroachment on China's sphere of influence that could lead to likely diplomatic friction.\n\"China has been actively helping Pakistan in developing its naval capability and its air force through the F-17 fighter jets that are collaboratively produced, and has facilitated sales of military equipment to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka as well as Myanmar,\" Wadhwa told DW.\nWadhwa also referred to the Philippines' 2022 purchase of a $375-million BrahMos anti-ship missile system.\n\"As far as the proposed Indian sale of BrahMos missiles to Indonesia and before that to the Philippines, it is all as a response to these countries seeking a defensive deterrent against Chinese aggression in the South China Sea,\" he said. He added that under these circumstances, India should not be overly concerned about a Chinese reaction.\nEdited by: Keith Walker\nhttps:/www.dw.com \n"

    "text": "\nFeb. 3—JAKARTA(The Jakarta Post/ANN) — Through 10 state visits he embarked upon during the first 100 days of his presidency, President Prabowo Subianto appears to send a clear message to the world.\nAs viewed by analysts, the former Army general was telling the world that he was a foreign policy president with a strong nationalist foundation. He also shows himself as comfortable with taking on the spotlight on the global stage, boosting Indonesia's global standing and going where his immediate predecessor would not.\n\"There was a promise of continuity on the [domestic] political front, but it's clear that Prabowo is no Jokowi on the international stage,\" said international relations expert Dafri Agussalim at Gadjah Mada University.\n\"He's very comfortable on the global stage; many of his moves are seemingly intuitive in nature.\"\nIn the past three months, Prabowo, who won last year's presidential election on a populist platform to spur the national economy and eradicate hunger, kept his schedule busy with high-level visits around the globe. The President regularly flew abroad to reaffirm Jakarta's foreign cooperation and promote its economic interests.\nThe list of countries he visited since his inauguration in October includes China, the United States, Brazil, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and India.\nBut the long list extended beyond those countries, as the former general's global campaign already started months before being sworn in as Indonesia's president.\nAfter the preliminary results of February's election showed his imminent victory, Prabowo, who served as Jokowi's defense minister, traveled to several major nations across Asia, Europe and the Middle East on a tour that experts dubbed as his bid to establish an international presence before officially taking office.\nRead also: Prabowo resumes European trip to Serbia, Turkey after French visit\nInstalling key ally\nPrabowo cemented his persona as a foreign policy president by installing Sugiono, a member of his Gerindra Party, to lead the traditionally professional Foreign Ministry. A day after the ministerial inauguration, Prabowo sent the new top diplomat to a BRICS summit in Russia as his first assignment.\nThe Russian assignment was then followed by a decision by Prabowo for Indonesia to join the economic grouping, which resulted in Indonesia joining as a full member as announced by Brazil in early January. Such a commitment contrasted years-long subtle messaging from Jokowi's administration that indicated Jakarta's reluctance to hop on the BRICS wagon.\nConcerns then surfaced that the BRICS move may potentially sour Indonesia's relationship with the United States after President Donald Trump took office for the second created_at. But the Foreign Ministry reiterated on several occasions that Jakarta's membership in the economic grouping was incentivized by economic benefits.\nEmphasizing its non-aligned position, the ministry reasserted that the BRICS move was a manifestation of a bolder free-and-active policy.\nRead also: Indonesia sees full BRICS membership as 'valuable' for Global South cooperation\n\"Prabowo is highly interested in geopolitics, and his foreign policy is reflective of his vision of what Indonesia ought to be seen as,\" Dafri said.\n\"The Foreign Ministry simply facilitates this vision that he tends toward being a solo player,\" he continued.\n'Visionary' diplomacy\nThe ministry made clear how Indonesia ought to be seen in Foreign Minister Sugiono's first annual speech in early January, with his diplomatic corps aiming to put Indonesia on the global stage \"in line with its stature as a great nation\" by, among other efforts, practicing \"anticipatory, progressive and visionary\" diplomacy.\nAnalysts previously noted that Prabowo's diplomacy had been centered on economy, like Jokowi's. But the sitting president is significantly more influenced by a nationalist ideology compared to his predecessor.\nInstead of measuring Jakarta's diplomatic effectiveness through indicators such as trade and export numbers, Prabowo has been motivated by a belief that Indonesia as a resource-rich country must be self-sufficient, respected and well-networked.\nRead also: Prabowo looks set to continue high int'l engagements in 2025\nBut such an ideology inspired Prabowo to make eyebrow-raising moves, including when he agreed through a joint statement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to kick-start joint development in so-called \"disputed\" areas of the South China Sea following a November meeting between the leaders in Beijing.\nThe statement triggered a diplomatic brouhaha for Jakarta, which later had to issue several statements underlining its unchanged position on the South China Sea, despite apparently nodding at Beijing's illegal dispute claim.\n\"The South China Sea agreement was clearly his way of using our natural resources as leverage for dealing with Beijing, all while reaping economic benefits. However, it's also impossible to ignore other crucial geopolitical contexts,\" said Yose Rizal Damuri, executive director for Jakarta-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\nThe researcher called on Prabowo to be \"a little more sensitive to these issues\", while conveying his hope that the President could integrate institutional and professional knowledge of the Foreign Ministry into his diplomacy efforts.\n© 2025 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany).

    "text": "\nThe Philippines on Sunday marked the 30th straight day of the Chinese coast guard's \"illegal\" deployment off Zambales, a province on the U.S. ally's heavily populated Luzon island.\nNewsweek reached out to the Philippine Coast Guard and Chinese Foreign Ministry with emailed requests for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nMultiple heavily armed Chinese coast guard ships have maintained this presence, well within the 200-nautical-mile [230-mile] exclusive economic zone (EEZ) where a country is entitled to resources under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). China claims upward of 90 percent of the South China Sea within its \"10-dashed line\" map.\nThe monthlong deployment brings the long-running territorial dispute with China, typically centered on several contested rocks and reefs, closer to the Philippines proper, further fueling tensions between the two neighbors. Manila has responded with its own coast guard, keeping up the pressure on its Chinese counterpart through continuous monitoring and radio challenges.\nWhat To Know\nOne of main ships testing the Philippines in this area is China Coast Guard 5901. The ship's considerable girth—measuring 540 feet from bow to stern and displacing 12,000 tons—has earned this the nickname \"the Monster.\"\nDespite dwarfing any ship in the Philippines—and indeed any country's—coast guard, the CCG-5901, was \"pushed back\" from 54 to around 120 nautical miles [62 to 138 miles] by the Southeast Asian country's BRP Teresa Magbanua, Philippine coast guard (PCG) spokesperson Jay Tarriela wrote on X (formerly Twitter) Sunday.\nTarriela said that, by ignoring the 2016 ruling in favor of the Philippines by an international arbitral court in The Hague, Beijing has shown a \"blatant disregard for international law and the established rules-based order.\"\nThe \"Monster\" was not the only ship reinforcing Beijing's maricreated_at claims in this area, however.\nOn Sunday morning, Chinese ships bearing the hull numbers 3301 and 3304 were spotted not far away, just 34 nautical miles [39 miles] off the coast of Pangasinan, a province of Luzon's Ilocos Region, Tarriela wrote in a separate X post.\nThe Philippines dispatched a par of its own patrol vessels to \"reinforce the Philippine government's position against the normalization of illegal patrols by the People's Republic of China within the Philippine exclusive economic zone,\" the spokesman added.\nOn Friday, there was a patrol by the Chinese coast guard at Scarborough Shoal—a hotly contested feature known in the Philippines as Bajo de Masinloc and in China as Huangyan Island—Chinese state media cited the maricreated_at agency as saying.\nThe rich fishing ground, which China effectively seized control of in 2012, sits about 140 miles west of Luzon and over 600 miles from the nearest Chinese shores.\nWhat People Are Saying\nRay Powell, director of Stanford University-affiliated maricreated_at analysis group SeaLight, wrote on X: \"China Coast Guard 3104 and 3301 continue their brazen intrusive patrol against the Philippines, coming within 25nm [nautical miles] of the Luzon coastline and demonstrating China's commitment to its 10-dash-line claim over the entire South China Sea.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nThe dispute is unlikely to be resolved anycreated_at soon, with China expected to continue its patrols in the EEZs of the Philippines and other neighboring countries.\nThe administration of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will likely continue its pushback, supported by 84 percent of Filipinos, according to a November 2024 survey of 1,200 respondents aged 18 and above by independent consulting firm OCTA Research.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nChina's \"Monster\" Coast Guard Ship\nPhilippine Coast Guard\nThis image shows China's \"Monster\" coast guard ship, CCG-5901 patrolling near the Philippines' Zambales Province on Sunday, within the Southeast Asian country's exclusive economic zone.\n"

Notably, the CCG vessels did not respond to the radio challenge issued by the PCG,\" Tarriela said.\n\"Currently, two PCG vessels, BRP Cabra (MRRV-4409) and BRP Bagacay (MRRV-4410) both 44-meter ships, have been dispatched to Bolinao, Pangasinan, to address the illegal presence of the China Coast Guard,\" he added.\nMoreover, he said the PCG vessels reminded the CCG that their presence is illegal, reinforcing the Philippine government's position against \"the normalization of illegal patrols\" within the country's exclusive economic zone.\nBeijing's continued aggression in the WPS is based on its assertion of sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the WPS, as it continues to reject the 2016 arbitral ruling that effectively dismissed its claims and ruled in favor of Manila.                    \n"

The Philippine Coast Guard also dispatched two vessels to the area.\nLocated about 125 nautical miles (232 km) from Luzon, Scarborough Shoal is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino fishermen but it has been under China's de facto control since 2012.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard is committed to \"preventing the normalization of the People's Republic of China's (PRC) illegal deployment of maricreated_at forces in the region,\" the agency said in a statement.\nThe BRP Teresa Magbanua, a local coast guard ship, has been \"actively challenging the presence of China Coast Guard 5901,\" which is now about 117 nautical miles from the country's coast, according to officials.\nDubbed \"The Monster,\" the CCG 5901 is the world's largest coast ship. The Philippine coast guard statement did not say how the Teresa Magbanua was challenging its bigger foreign counterpart.\n\"Today marks the 30th consecutive day of the China Coast Guard's illegal presence in the waters off Zambales,\" the PCG said in its statement Saturday, referring to another province on Luzon's west coast.\nThe refusal of the Chinese vessel to leave the Philippine EEZ is a \"blatant disregard for international law and the established rules-based order,\" it said.\nChinese navy ships off southern Philippines\nMeanwhile, the Philippine Navy said it escorted three Chinese naval warships, including a cruiser-guided missile class vessel, out of Philippine waters on Monday. The vessels were first monitored Sunday off the coast of the southern Philippine provinces of Zamboanga and Basilan.\n\"The said PLA [People's Liberation Army] navy vessels transited without prior diplomatic coordination and maintained an unusually slow speed of four to five knots,\" said Maj. Orlando Aylon Jr., a regional military spokesman based in Zamboanga.\nThe three People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy vessels seen by Philippine authorities included a Jianki Class Frigate II, a Renhai Class Cruiser Guided Missile and a Type 903 Fuchi Class Replenishment Oiler.\n\"This is not consistent with the principles of innocent passage which requires continuous and expeditious passage and that the vessels should not linger in archipelagic waters longer than necessary,\" said Lt. Gen. Antonio Nafarrete, chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines' Western Mindanao Command.\nChina defended the passage of its naval vessels in the area, saying they conducted training exercises in the open sea.\n\"The Chinese naval vessels' passage through the Basilan Strait is in full compliance with ... international law and practice,\" a spokesperson for the Chinese PLA Southern Theater Command said on Monday.\nThe Philippines' \"act of smearing and hyping up the Chinese naval vessels' normal passage through the Basilan Strait has seriously undermined the normal navigation rights of other countries including China,\" the spokesperson added.\nBeijing's taking possession of Scarborough Shoal forced Manila to file a lawsuit at the world court in The Hague 13 years ago.\nIn 2016, an international arbitration tribunal ruled in Manila's favor but Beijing has never acknowledged that decision.\nGeopolitical analyst Julio Amador III, who closely monitors the South China Sea, said it was too early to determine the Chinese navy vessels' intentions but he noted that the principle of \"freedom of navigation\" applied.\nThe same could also be said about China's \"monster\" ship. As long as it maintained its distance in the periphery of Scarborough, that should not escalate the tension in the area, Amador said.\n\"But if it goes inside the lagoon and then patrols while challenging our claims, then there are grounds for protest,\" he told BenarNews.\n\"The only difference between that ship and the CCG ships in 2012 is the size.\"\nHe was referring to the first incident when Chinese vessels entered the area and unleashed an international crisis that later resulted in Manila's filing of a lawsuit against Beijing.\nThe \"monster\" ship's presence there \"is to remind us that they are making claims on Scarborough.\"\n\"They want control of the waters,\" Amador said.\nBenarNews is an RFA-affiliated online news organizations.\n"

On the same day, the PCG also said it had tried to drive away two CCG vessels off the coast of Pangasinan, a province directly south of Zambales.\nSee also: Philippines notes 'illegal' presence of China ships in maricreated_at zone  \nBeijing yet to respond to Philippines arresting more Chinese for 'spying'  \nSouth Africa again requests relocation of Taiwan liaison office\nTaiwan's Foreign Ministry said it has received another request to move its liaison office in South Africa away from the administrative capital of Pretoria by the end of March.\nCiting a statement from the ministry, Taiwan's Central News Agency (CNA) reported on 2 February that the South African government has sent another letter in late January demanding the relocation and even sought to \"downgrade\" the office to a \"trade office\".\nThe foreign ministry also said that Pretoria's latest demand came at a created_at the two sides are still in talks, which shows that \"China is intensifying its suppression of Taiwan in South Africa\".\nIt added that South Africa should uphold the 1997 bilateral agreement that allows Taipei to continue to operate a liaison office in Pretoria.\nAccording to a report from CNA's English-language edition, South Africa first made an oral request for Taiwan to relocate its office in December 2023, followed by an official letter in April 2024. Another request for relocation was made in October 2024 with a deadline at the end of that month.&#160;\nHowever, the deadline was later withdrawn after the two sides began negotiations.\nThe report added that while it remains unclear why the South African government resumed its demand, it happened after the Chinese embassy in Pretoria announced sanctions on 9 January against Ivan Meyer, federal chair of South Africa's second largest party, the Democratic Alliance, for recently visiting Taiwan.&#160;\nThe embassy accused Meyer of \"blatantly violating the one-China principle\".\nSee also: Briefing: South Africa 'demands' Taiwan moves office from administrative capital (October 2024)\nBriefing: Chinese foreign ministers' new year trips to Africa over 35 years  \nTaiwan bans government use of China AI app DeepSeek\nTaiwan recently banned public sector workers from using DeepSeek, a recently-released Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) model, due to concerns over data leaks.\nOn 31 January, Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs said the ban applies to employees of central and local government agencies, public schools, state-owned enterprises and other semi-official organisations, as well as those working on critical infrastructure projects and in government-endowed foundations, CNA reported.\n\"DeepSeek's AI service is a Chinese product, and its operation involves cross-border transmission and information leakage and other information security concerns, and is a product that jeopardises the country's information security,\" the ministry said in a statement.\nHowever, the ban has divided political opinion.

It further said there was an average of over 300 million trips daily between 31 January and 2 February, surpassing levels in 2024.\nCCTV's Xinwen Lianbo also reported that total box office takings (including pre-sales) for the 2025 Spring Festival had exceeded 5.5bn yuan as of 1 February. It said that from the first day of the Lunar New Year on 29 January to 1 February, domestic daily box office revenue had exceeded 1bn for four consecutive days.

    "text": "\nWhile United States President Donald Trump was sparring with Colombia's leader Gustavo Petro over the military deportation of migrants, China's ambassador to the Latin American country, Zhu Jingyang, declared that relations between Beijing and Bogotá were at their \"best moment\" in decades.\nZhu later said that his comment on social media last week, the day after Trump said he would impose tariffs on Colombia, was a coincidence. But the scope of the publication suggests that Beijing saw an opportunity to strengthen its position in the rivalry between China and the US.\nTwo weeks after Trump's inauguration ceremony, the Republican's \"America First\" foreign policy represents both a promise and a danger for Beijing.\nThe dangers have always been clear: more tariffs and the risk of a wider trade war. At the weekend, Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff on goods imported from China, saying the measure was a response to Beijing's failure to curb fentanyl exports.\nWhile the Asian country is calculating the impact of the tariffs on its fragile economy, it is also assessing the opportunities that Trump's other moves are giving Beijing.\nTrump, for example, has alienated US allies and partners, such as Canada and Mexico, by imposing high tariffs on their exports and has weakened Washington's global authority by cutting foreign aid and withdrawing from the WHO (World Health Organization) and the Paris Agreement, a UN climate pact.\nIf Trump's second term marks the sunset of Pax Americana, analysts say China will almost certainly seize the opportunity to try to reshape the world in its favor. Beijing, which has long accused Washington of using its dominance to contain Chinese growth, has been trying to create a divide between the US and its allies, including the European Union, Japan and Australia.\n\"The Chinese are well aware of the damage Trump has done and is doing to US credibility and influence globally. In fact, it's unfolding faster than even Beijing expected,\" says Evan S. Medeiros, professor of Asian studies at Georgetown University, who served as President Barack Obama's Asia affairs adviser.\nTrump's threats to seize the Panama Canal and Greenland, as well as to annex Canada as the 51st US state, could normalize a world order in which force prevails. This is a familiar approach for Beijing, even if the Chinese authorities maintain the rhetoric that they have never sought hegemony or expansion.\nIf the US pressures Panama over its waterway or forces Denmark to give up the resource-rich territory of Greenland, it will send a signal to China that when it comes to its own claims over the autonomous island of Taiwan and much of the South China Sea, for example, coercion trumps cooperation.\n\"China would certainly never give up Taiwan or the South China Sea, but with Trump doing what he's doing, it's even more determined to protect its interests there, that's for sure,\" says Henry Huiyao Wang, president of the China and Globalization Center in Beijing.\nWang says that Beijing has been encouraged by the first two weeks of the new government, despite the tariffs and the appointment of bellicose advisors such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security advisor Michael Waltz.\nInstead of coming out aggressively to confront China, Trump presented himself as someone willing to negotiate and potentially close a deal with the country's leader, Xi Jinping. The Republican suggested linking tariffs to the fate of , which, according to him, .\nAnother potential area for negotiations is Ukraine, invaded by Russia almost three years ago. Trump said that China should help end the war in the Eastern European country - China, as Moscow's biggest economic supplier, could put pressure on President Vladimir Putin to sit down at the negotiating table.\n\"Trump wants China's help to end the Ukrainian war,\" said Wang. \"China is one of the best partners for him to do that.\"\nBut with so many competing interests, cooperation is difficult.\nBeijing avoids criticizing the invasion of Ukraine, for example, adopting the position that Russia has the right to protect its national security. Kiev, for its part, would not accept China as a mediator because of its pro-Russian stance, says Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. Putin, on the other hand, won't want to appear subordinate to China, he says, while Trump has no stomach for seeing Beijing praised for playing a significant role.\nOn the issue of tariffs, Beijing has to decide whether it can afford to escalate a trade war with the US. On Sunday, the country promised to respond to Trump's tariffs by filing a case with the WTO (World Trade Organization) and with other as yet unspecified measures.\nBeijing could, for example, retaliate with new tariffs. A more drastic approach, however, would be to engage in a \"supply chain war\": stopping shipments of critical materials and equipment to US industry. At the beginning of December, China stopped the export to the US of minerals such as antimony and gallium, which are needed to manufacture some semiconductors.\nThe risk for China is that a trade war will be more damaging for itself than for Washington. Exports and the construction of factories to produce them are among the few strengths in China's economy today. As a result, the country's trade surplus - the amount by which its exports exceeded imports - reached almost US$1 trillion last year.\nIn the race for global influence, some argue that the Trump administration's decision to freeze much foreign aid, which has disrupted aid programs around the world, has already benefited China.\nIn regions such as Southeast Asia, where the stance towards the US has hardened because of Washington's support for Israel in the war in the Gaza Strip, the interruption of funding has raised questions about the reliability of the US country.\n\"China doesn't need to do anything at the moment and yet somehow it looks like the good guy,\" says Jeremy Chan, senior analyst on China at Eurasia Group.\n"

    "text": "\n Two Chinese coast guard vessels were spotted off Pangasinan province, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said on Sunday, while Beijing's so-called 'monster ship' continued to linger near Zambales province for about a month now.\nThe PCG deployed an aircraft and two 44-meter ships, the BRP Cabra (MRRV-4409) and the BRP Bagacay (MRRV-4410), to Bolinao, Pangasinan, after it sighted China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels with bow numbers 3301 and 3104 some 65 kilometers (34 nautical miles) from the shore through Canada's satellite tracking system, PCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela said in a statement.\nThe deployment of the PCG vessels was meant to 'reinforce the Philippine government's position against the normalization of illegal patrols by the People's Republic of China within the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ),' he said.\nWithin EEZ\nHowever, the radio challenges issued by the PCG were ignored by the Chinese ships, Tarriela noted.\nThe 12,000-ton CCG-5901, or the 'monster ship,' replaced CCG-3304 operating off Zambales on Saturday.\nAlthough it was pushed further away by the PCG's BRP Teresa Magbanua (MRRV-9701) 213 km (115 nautical miles) from the coastline, it remained within the Philippines' EEZ.\n'The crew aboard BRP Teresa Magbanua demonstrated remarkable courage and resolve, remaining undeterred by the presence of the massive CCG-5901,' Tarriela said in a separate statement.\nChina's goal\n'The PCG has consistently asserted that the actions of the [CCG] are illegal and in violation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), to which China is a signatory,' he pointed out.\nThe massive ship was first monitored off Capones Island in the waters of Zambales on Jan. 4 after patrolling Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal and has stayed within that area since.\nSmaller Chinese vessels have also tried to move closer to the coast of the Philippines since then.\nTarriela earlier said China's goal was to normalize such deployments, which would enable them 'to alter the existing status quo' if these actions go unchallenged.\nMindoro, Lawak\n'What we're doing there is, hour by hour and day by day, we're challenging the illegal presence of the Chinese coast guard for the international community to know that we're not going to allow China to normalize the illegal deployment,' he stressed.\nAt least nine Chinese coast guard vessels were spotted within the Philippines' EEZ during the weekend, American maricreated_at security expert Ray Powell said on Saturday.\nCCG 3104 and 3301 were tracked near Cabra Island off Occidental Mindoro before heading to Pangasinan, while CCG 5202 passed within 6.5 km (3.5 nautical miles) of Philippine-occupied Lawak (Nanshan) Island, he said.\nChinese vessels have been keeping a constant presence in the West Philippine Sea-part of the South China Sea being claimed by the Philippines-to enforce Beijing's excessive maricreated_at and territorial claims.\nAn international arbitration tribunal ruled in 2016 that China's historical claims have no basis under international law, a decision Beijing has refused to recognize.\n"

More than any other place on China's coastline, Inner Deep Bay demonstrates that with help, resilient nature can still thrive, even when boxed in and overshadowed by towering cities like Shenzhen. Another successful example of man's intervention on behalf of nature can be glimpsed in the waters around Lantau Island. \nWhile egrets make the most of an easy meal, other creatures have their eye on the fishermen's catch. Chinese White dolphins are estuary specialists. Found widely in the Indian and Pacific Ocean, this species is rare in China. The young are born dark grey and become spotted as adolescents, finally turning creamy-white as adults, though on some occasions they may blush a delicate shade of pink. Three groups of dolphins live close to Lantau Island. As the tide comes in, they move with it to feed on small fish or squid which travel with the currents, using echolocation to \"see\" their prey through the murky water. They also use sound to communicate. DOLPHIN SQUEAKS But they face a deafening problem. BOAT ENGINES ROAR The Pearl Estuary has become one of the busiest shipping channels in China and the dolphins are constantly bombarded with sound. New research suggests that they may now pack more information into shorter calls in a bid to be heard. Local conservationists have now set up a protected zone near Lantau Island. So for now, China's white dolphins are holding on. South of Hong Kong lies the South China Sea, studded with more than 200 hundred islands and reefs. Potential reserves of fish, oil and gas make each one strategic and the whole region has become a political hot-spot, as territorial disputes simmer between its many neighbouring countries. The waters themselves are low in nutrients and would be poor in life if it wasn't for the other resource that's here in abundance. Sunlight. In the shallows of the coral atolls, small jellyfish point their tentacles towards the sun. Like many animals here, they depend on a close partnership with microscopic algae which turn solar power into food. The most famous of these relationships is the reef-forming corals, which provide the foundation of the sea's most dazzling ecosystem. Their branches provide shelter for a wealth of small and vulnerable creatures... many of them beautifully camouflaged. But the ultimate master of disguise has to be the octopus, able to change not only its shape and colour, but its skin texture too.\n"

A TV Licence - for all TV channels and BBC iPlayer. From the eastern end of the Great Wall, China's coast spans 14,500 kilometres and more than 5,000 years of history. This is the area which shows the greatest contrast between China's past and its future. Today, China's eastern seaboard is home to 700 million people, packed into some of the most dazzling hi-tech cities on earth. Yet, these crowded shores remain hugely important for a wealth of wildlife. Now, as ancient traditions mingle with new aspirations, is there any room at all for wildlife on China's crowded shores? In northern China's Zhalong Nature Reserve, a pair of red-crowned cranes have staked out their nesting territory in the stubble of a commercially managed reed bed. For centuries, cranes have been revered in China as symbols of longevity. Their statues were placed next to the Emperor's throne. The cranes have cause to celebrate. This chick is a sign of hope in difficult created_ats. Red-crowned cranes are one of the world's most endangered species. Over the last century, China has lost nearly half of its coastal wetlands and most of what remains is managed for the benefit of people, not wildlife. A few months from now, this chick and its parents will face a long migration south to escape the harsh northern winter. Their route will take them along a coast which has been greatly affected by human activity. Along their journey, the cranes will be joined by many thousands of other migrating birds, all heading south across the Bohai Gulf and along the shores of the Yellow and East China Seas. Some even reaching as far as the South China Sea in search of a safe winter haven. The annual bird migration has been going on for thousands of years. Here at Mount Jinping, on China's northeast coast, there is surprising evidence that people have lived here almost as long. Seven thousand years ago, members of the Shao Hao tribe carved magical symbols representing significant elements of their daily lives. The petroglyphs show wheat sheaves connected by lines to human figures, the first-known recordings of cultivation in China.\n"

    "text": "\nPresident Trump's tariffs hurt China, but his other actions have alienated U.S. allies, giving Beijing an opening to strengthen its global standing.\nAs President Trump was locked in a war of words with the leader of Colombia over the military deportation of migrants, China's ambassador to Colombia declared that relations between Beijing and Bogotá were at their ''best moment'' in decades. \n  Zhu Jingyang, the ambassador, later said that it was a coincidence that he posted his comment on social media last week, a day after Mr. Trump said he would slap tariffs on Colombia. But the public outreach suggested that Beijing saw an opportunity to strengthen its hand in the high-stakes superpower rivalry between China and the United States.\n  Two weeks into the second Trump administration, Mr. Trump's aggressive ''America First'' foreign policy holds both promise and peril for Beijing.\n  The perils have always been clear: more tariffs, and the risk of a wider trade war. This weekend, Mr. Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariffs on goods imported from China, saying the tariffs were a response to China's failure to curb fentanyl exports. He could answer any retaliation from China with even higher levies.\n  But even as Beijing calculates the impact of the tariffs on China's weak economy, it is surely also taking stock of the openings that Mr. Trump's other moves are giving China.\n  Mr. Trump has alienated U.S. allies and partners like Canada and Mexico by imposing steep tariffs on their exports. He has weakened America's global authority by cutting foreign aid and withdrawing from the World Health Organization and the Paris Agreement, a U.N. climate pact.\n  If the second Trump term marks the sunset of Pax Americana, analysts say China will almost certainly use the opportunity to try to reshape the world in its favor. Beijing, which has long accused Washington of using its dominance to contain China's rise, has tried to drive a wedge between the United States and its allies, including the European Union, Japan and Australia.\n  ''The Chinese are well aware of the damage Trump has done and is doing to U.S. credibility and influence globally. In fact, it is unfolding faster than even Beijing expected,'' said Evan S. Medeiros, a professor of Asian studies at Georgetown University who served as an Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n  Mr. Trump's threats to take the Panama Canal and Greenland, as well as to annex Canada as America's 51st state could normalize a world order in which might makes right. That is an approach that is familiar to Beijing, even if Chinese officials rhetorically maintain that it will never seek hegemony or expansion.\n  If the United States strong-arms Panama over its crucial waterway, or forces Denmark to give up the resource-rich territory of Greenland, it sends a signal to China that when it comes to its own claims to the self-governing island of Taiwan and much of the South China Sea, coercion trumps cooperation.\n  ''China was certainly never going to give up Taiwan or the South China Sea, but with President Trump doing what he's doing, China is even more determined to safeguard its interests there, that's for sure,'' said Henry Huiyao Wang, president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing.\n  Mr. Wang said China has been encouraged by the first two weeks of the new administration despite the tariffs and appointment of hawkish advisers such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser.\n  Rather than coming out aggressively to confront China, Mr. Trump has presented himself as someone willing to negotiate and potentially cut a deal with Xi Jinping, China's leader. Mr. Trump has floated the idea of tying tariffs to the fate of TikTok, which he has said should be half-owned by an American company.\n  Another potential area for deal making is Ukraine. Mr. Trump has said China should help end Russia's war in the Eastern European country. China, as Russia's biggest provider of economic and material support, could conceivably pressure President Vladimir V. Putin to come to the negotiation table.\n  ''Trump wants China's help to end the war in Ukraine,'' Mr. Wang said. ''China is one of the best partners for him to do that.''\n  But with so many competing interests, cooperation would be difficult. China has avoided criticizing Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for example, taking the position that Russia has a right to protect its national security. Ukraine will not accept China as a peace broker because of China's pro-Russian position, said Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing. Mr. Putin, on the other hand, will not want to look subordinate to China, he said, while Mr. Trump has ''no real stomach'' to see China lauded for playing a significant role.\n  On the issue of tariffs, Beijing has to decide if it can afford to escalate a trade war with the United States. On Sunday, it vowed to respond to Mr. Trump's tariffs by filing a case with the World Trade Organization and with countermeasures to be specified later.\n  Beijing could hit back with tariffs. A more drastic approach would be for China to engage in ''supply chain warfare'': halting shipments to the United States of materials and equipment critical to U.S. industry. In early December, China stopped the export to the United States of minerals like antimony and gallium, which are needed to manufacture some semiconductors.\n  The risk to China is that a trade war would be more damaging to itself than it would be for the United States. Exports, and the construction of factories to make them, are among the few strengths now in China's economy. As a result, China's trade surplus -- the amount by which its exports exceeded imports -- reached almost $1 trillion last year.\n  China has also not yet said how it will respond to a potentially farther-reaching provision in the fine print of Mr. Trump's executive order on Saturday: the elimination of duty-free handling for packages worth up to $800 per day for each American. Factories all over China have shifted in recent years to e-commerce shipments directly to American homes, so as to bypass the many tariffs collected on clothing and other goods that are imported and sold through American stores.\n  In the race for global influence, some argue that the Trump administration's move to freeze most foreign aid, which has disrupted aid programs around the world, has already benefited China.\n  In regions like Southeast Asia, where attitudes toward the United States have hardened because of Washington's support for Israel in the Gaza war, the halt in funding has raised questions about American reliability.\n  ''China needs to do nothing in the meancreated_at, and yet, somehow, net-net, look like the good guy in all of this,'' said Jeremy Chan, a senior analyst on China at the Eurasia Group.\n  Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, defended the importance of soft power to America's standing.\n  ''If you don't get involved in the world and you don't have programs in Africa, where China is trying to buy the whole continent, we're making a mistake,'' he said last month.\n\n\n\nGraphic\n \nPHOTO: President Donald Trump's freeze on foreign aid could be opening up opportunities for China to boost its standing on the global stage.

This may be a short-term victory but we will see how long this will go going forward. Is it really about Panama or is it about China's influence in increasing influence in central America?\n We've got to talk about the presence of Chinese company in and around the Panama Canal. The focus has been on one company in particular, Hutchinson holdings which is at a lease to operate two key ports on either side of the canal. The concern, let's say US and China ever got into a conflict over Taiwan or the South China Sea and the US Navy needs to send some of their vessels quickly from the Atlantic onto the Pacific, the Panama Canal is the fastest way. And potentially a Chinese company could somehow disrupt the US Naval access they are. It's really not just Hutchinson holdings. There are other Chinese state owned enterprises and others that have strategic projects in and around the Panama Canal. It does behoove the US in order to try to find ways to protect their national sovereignty. Not just in Panama, you can look at other countries in that region where China has been using soft power. There is the irony, on the day whether US USAID office has been shattered and the United States is turning away from the soft power, we seen from the Panama President stating, we signed up to this Belt and Road initiative in 2017, along came the investment following that. That is what soft power is all about. It seems the administration is turning its back on that. That is right. During his press conference the President took a jab at the US to say I invited the Secretary of State here to talk about investment. And over the past few years there's been a space that the US has left really to other countries, of course China in order to invest in Panama. It will be interesting to see one, the president his created_at will end as president in a few years. Will a Panamanian president come to replace him that will be more pro-China? Like one of his predecessors who under his leadership Panama switched recognition from Taiwan to mainland China. Another issue, I want to go back to the fact that this is just one of several Chinese companies that are operating in and around the Panama Canal. So the Panamanian government said they will do a comprehensive audit of the Hutchinson operations but they need to do a more comprehensive audit of those other Chinese companies as well. What they can do, the kind of threats they can post to the Panama Canal and the potential espionage and surveillance capabilities that they could be doing in the Panama Canal. Thank you very much.

    "text": "\nPresident Donald Trump's tariffs on Beijing could eventually push China's leader, Xi Jinping, to target U.S. tech companies or curb the export of minerals critical to the American economy, according to an expert on China.\nNewsweek has contacted the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nThe president has also imposed 25-percent levies on Canada and Mexico in a move he has linked to irregular immigration and cross-border flows of the opioid fentanyl.\nTrump's measures have sparked fears of a trade war which could hit the pockets of American consumers amid concern over how China and Mexico, will respond, with Canada having already announced retaliatory duties.\nWhat To Know\nCraig Singleton, from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), a Washington, D.C. think tank, outlined a suite of measures that Beijing might deploy in response to Trump's 10-percent levy on its goods.\nAfter Trump's move, China's Ministry of Commerce said on Sunday that it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and take countermeasures, without specifying further.\nSingleton, a senior China fellow at the FDD, told Newsweek that Xi will be weighing up how to project strength at home and abroad while avoiding exacerbating the country's economic vulnerabilities or triggering a costly escalation of the situation.\nXi is unlikely to match Trump's tariffs dollar for dollar because China's export-driven economy is more vulnerable than that of the U.S., but he might privately signal an openness to negotiation, using intermediaries for a face-saving compromise, Singleton said.\nShould Trump's tariffs cause disproportionate damage for China, Xi may target U.S. tech companies, curb rare-earth exports or economically pressure Washington's allies in Asia to weaken regional coalitions, said Singleton.\nXi might also escalate military provocations in the South China Sea or step up cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure, to pressure Washington indirectly.\nChina also has leverage over the U.S. strategic supply chain and could target advanced batteries, semiconductors, solar components, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture which would amplify costs for rivals.\nSingleton said that China will frame Trump's tariffs as \"unilateral and destabilizing,\" which it could exploit by portraying itself as a steady hand amid U.S. volatility and so deepen partnerships with emerging markets.\nWhat People Are Saying\nSingleton said: \"At home, Xi is expected to frame tariffs as a test of China's resilience, emphasizing moral superiority and endurance.\n\"Invoking metaphors like the 'Long March,' he will likely cast economic sacrifices as necessary steps toward achieving China's long-term strategic goals.\"\nThe Long March refers to a year-long trek Mao Zedong and his revolutionary forces made in the 1930s during the war with the nationalists.\nChina's Commerce Ministry in a statement: \"The unilateral imposition of tariffs by the United States seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization. It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also undermines the normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States.\n\"China will file a lawsuit with the WTO for the wrong practices of the United States and will take corresponding countermeasures to firmly safeguard its own rights and interests.\"\nWhat happens next\nSingleton said that Chinese state media will portray Trump's tariffs as acts of external aggression, while rallying domestic support.\nBeijing's statement is less detailed than the responses from Mexico and Canada. On Saturday, Ottawa announced an initial 25-percent tariff on 155-billion Canadian dollars' worth ($106 billion) of U.S. goods.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nDonald Trump\nThis image from September 23, 2024  in Smithton, Pennsylvania, shows Donald Trump addressing a rally about China's impact on U.S. agriculture.\n"

    "title": "Tsai Ing-wen's Legacy: Taiwan's Resilience Amid Shifting Alliances",
    "created_at": "2025-02-03",
    "text": "\n In her eight years as president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen led the island nation through an era of growing threats and geopolitical challenges, all while reinforcing Taiwan's democratic values and strengthening its military defenses. With the looming uncertainties surrounding Taiwan's international security, Tsai's leadership remains a focal point as she prepares for her next steps on the global stage.\nDuring her presidency, Tsai was faced with increasing pressures from China, which has long viewed Taiwan as a renegade province. Beijing's calls for reunification by force intensified, and Tsai had to skillfully manage Taiwan's international relations, especially with the United States. However, as The created_ats UK reports, one of her significant concerns today is the unpredictability of U.S. leadership, particularly with former President Donald Trump back in power.\nTrump's relationship with Taiwan had been strong during his first term, but recent statements and shifting policies have left Taipei on edge. Trump had publicly criticized Taiwan's defense spending, questioning whether the island was contributing adequately to its own defense. Tsai acknowledges these concerns, stating, 'We got that message and we'll be more than happy to talk about strengthening our defense capability.' She emphasizes Taiwan's readiness to increase investment in its defense forces to address U.S. concerns and ensure the island's security against increasing threats.\nHer diplomatic skill has been honed over years of delicate negotiations, notably with the Trump administration. Tsai recalls, 'Strong, frequent, and clear communication on national security was the foundation of my bond with the Trump administration.' This relationship helped Taiwan secure critical arms deals, including the $8 billion purchase of F-16 fighter jets. This collaboration elevated Taiwan's defense capacity at a created_at when Chinese military expansion, especially in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, became increasingly concerning.\nBut while Tsai found success in maintaining a close alliance with the U.S., her leadership was also tested by the larger geopolitical landscape. The war in Ukraine provided Taiwan with an opportunity to demonstrate its strategic thinking on global security. Reflecting on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Tsai remarked, 'I'm sure that Beijing is watching the Ukraine war very closely and trying to learn from the conflict. I hope that they draw the lesson that waging a war across the Taiwan Strait is going to cost them a lot [militarily, politically, and financially].' She firmly believes that any Chinese military adventurism against Taiwan would have dire consequences not just for the island, but for global stability.\nDespite facing these enormous challenges, Tsai's administration also focused on Taiwan's economic resilience and global standing. Taiwan has long been a critical player in the global semiconductor industry, and Tsai underscored the island's importance beyond just economic terms. 'Taiwan has gained global prominence because of the success of its semiconductor industry, but the world should know that Taiwan is much more than a leading chip manufacturer,' she stated. The country's values, including its commitment to democracy and human rights, helped set Taiwan apart on the world stage. Under her leadership, Taiwan became the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage, a historic moment for LGBTQ rights in the region.\nHowever, Taiwan's diplomatic isolation remains a serious challenge. Due to Chinese pressure, only 12 countries formally recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state. This has severely restricted Tsai's international engagements. In an attempt to shore up Taiwan's global alliances, she visited countries like the Czech Republic, France, and Canada. A planned visit to the United Kingdom was postponed, a casualty of the timing of the British Foreign Secretary's visit to Beijing. Despite these setbacks, Tsai remains steadfast in her belief that Taiwan's message needs to reach the world.\nOn the topic of the United Kingdom's evolving stance towards China, Tsai expressed concerns but also acknowledged that diplomacy requires balance. She commented, 'If the Labour Party gets to know the Communist authorities better, there could be possibilities for maintaining balance across the Taiwan Strait.' Taiwan is fully aware of the complexities of international politics, especially when it involves major powers like China and the U.S.\nPerhaps most telling of Tsai's leadership is her unflinching commitment to Taiwan's autonomy and defense. While maintaining a stance of strategic ambiguity on Taiwan's independence, Tsai has made it clear that Taiwan is already, in many ways, a sovereign entity. 'We are pretty much on our own,' she said, citing Taiwan's fully functional government, military, and judiciary. 'We have everything.'\nTaiwan's resilience, Tsai emphasized, is rooted not only in its ability to survive but in its unwavering commitment to uphold democratic values. 'Notext should underestimate our resolve to defend our freedom and democracy,' she said, reaffirming Taiwan's stance in the face of mounting pressures.\nDespite her formidable public role, Tsai's personal journey is equally compelling. Describing herself in her younger years as a quiet and reserved individual, she acknowledged how politics had forced her to evolve into a more public figure. 'Politics destroyed that part of my life. I used to be very quiet and didn't want to be too bothered by other people,' she reflected. Now, as a former president and an influential figure in Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, Tsai's voice continues to shape the island's international strategy.\nWith tensions across the Taiwan Strait unlikely to ease anycreated_at soon, Tsai's diplomatic legacy will likely serve as a critical foundation for Taiwan's continued fight for survival in an increasingly divided world. Whether or not her successor, President Lai Ching-te, will carry forward her strategies remains to be seen. However, Tsai's unyielding resolve and her careful balancing act between defense, diplomacy, and international values will undoubtedly remain a benchmark for Taiwan's future.\n"

    "text": "\nMANILA, Philippines — U.S. and Philippine fighter aircraft staged a joint patrol and training Tuesday over a disputed South China Sea shoal where Chinese fighter jets fired flares last year to drive away a Philippine aircraft, Philippine officials said.\nThe joint patrol and air-intercept drills over the hotly disputed Scarborough Shoal off the northwestern Philippines were the first by the longcreated_at treaty allies since U.S. President Donald Trump took office again.\nTrump’s “America First” foreign policy thrust has sparked concerns among Washington’s allies in Asia about the scale and depth of U.S. commitment to the region in his new term. His predecessor, former President Joe Biden, had moved to strengthen an arc of security alliances in the region to counter China’s increasingly assertive actions.\nChina pushing Philippines ‘to the wall’ with sea aggression: Manila\nTwo U.S. Air Force B-1 bomber aircraft and three Philippine Air Force FA-50 fighter jets joined the brief patrol and training, which involved practicing how to intercept a hostile aircraft, Philippine Air Force spokesperson Maria Consuelo Castillo said in a news briefing.\nIt was not immediately known if the joint patrol encountered any challenge from Chinese forces guarding the Scarborough Shoal.\n\"The exercises focused on enhancing operational coordination, improving air domain awareness and reinforcing agile combat employment capabilities between the two air forces,” the Philippine Air Force said.\nIn August last year, two Chinese air force aircraft flew close then fired flares in the path of a Philippine Air Force plane on routine patrol over the Scarborough Shoal in actions that were strongly condemned and protested by the Philippine government, military officials said.\nAll those aboard the Philippine Air Force NC-212i turboprop transport plane were unharmed, the Philippine military said.\nThe Southern Theater Command of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army said then that a Philippine air force aircraft “illegally” entered the airspace above the shoal and disrupted training activities by Chinese forces. It warned the Philippines to “stop its infringement, provocation, distortion and hyping-up.\"\nThe Philippine military chief, Gen. Romeo Brawner, said at the created_at that the incident “posed a threat to Philippine air force aircraft and its crew, interfered with lawful flight operations in airspace within Philippine sovereignty and jurisdiction and contravened international law and regulations governing safety of aviation.\"\nChina and the Philippines have had increasingly alarming faceoffs in the shoal, which is called Bajo de Masinloc by the Philippines and Huangyan Island by China.\n\"We are always prepared for any contingency, it’s part of the training,” Castillo said when asked if the allied forces had prepared to address any challenge by Chinese aircraft.\n“It already happened before and, as I have said, whatever the coercive, aggressive actions of any foreign party, the Philippine Air Force will not be deterred to perform its mandate,” Castillo said.\nThe U.S. military has reported encountering such dangerous maneuvers by Chinese air force planes in the past over the disputed waters, where it has deployed fighter jets and navy ships to promote freedom of navigation and overflight.\nChina has bristled at U.S. military deployments in the disputed region, saying these have endangered regional security.\nAside from China and the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan have overlapping territorial claims in the busy sea passage, a key global trade and security route, but hostilities have particularly flared in the past two years between Chinese and Philippine coast guard and navy forces in the Scarborough Shoal and another fiercely contested atoll, the Second Thomas Shoal.\nWashington has repeatedly warned that it’s obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if Philippine forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea.\n"

    "title": "Manila And Beijing Should Crawl Out Of The Dangerous Pit And Not Slither Into Conflict In South China Sea – OpEd",
    "created_at": "2025-02-04",
    "text": "\nTensions in the South China Sea continue to boil. Mutual distrust is fueling a risky action-reaction dynamic. Both sides are trying to prevent the other from perceived attempts to alter the status quo. Sensing that it is not getting much support from ASEAN, including fellow claimant coastal states, Manila fell back on its U.S. alliance, expanded ties with Japan and other extra-regional partners as far as Europe. The country opened its territory, waters and airspace for access, drills, and patrols with U.S. and other partners. This inadvertently brings Chinese vessels and aircraft closer to their American rivals, raising the specter of accidents and demanding stronger crisis management mechanisms.\nMaricreated_at exercises and sails by the Philippines and its allies and partners in choppy waters are being met by similar Chinese drills. Notwithstanding efforts to de-escalate and prevent conflict, untoward sea and air encounters between Manila and Beijing become more frequent. Chinese ship presence in the Philippines' western exclusive economic zone surged, intimidating local fishers and straining the capacity of Manila's coastguard to respond. Chinese measures escalate from gray zone to actual use of force, moving from swarming and lasers to ramming and water cannons, all along weathering reputational costs. To compensate for its capacity shortfall and huge power disparity vis-à-vis its big neighbor disputant, Manila allowed an increased U.S. military footprint and allowed its longcreated_at treaty ally to deploy a controversial mid-range missile system. These steps have yet to deter Chinese actions in the flashpoint. While China's image as an intruder and bully plays into perceptions of the conflict, Philippine actions undoubtedly fuel questions about agency and proportionality as underwhelming diplomacy fails to halt deteriorating bilateral ties.\nClash of approaches: optics and realities \nExperiencing a series of clashes raises the urgency of de-escalation. For the first created_at, three meetings under the Philippines-China Bilateral Consultative Mechanism (BCM) were held in a year. The 9th BCM hosted by Manila in July and another meeting between the heads of the BCM from each side held in Beijing in September helped defuse crises in Second Thomas and Sabina Shoals, respectively. BCM was a vice-ministerial dialogue platform established in 2016. While BCM in the past Duterte government was moving towards exploring practical cooperation, including a possible joint offshore petroleum undertaking, BCM under the Marcos Jr. administration has been preoccupied with firefighting, dialing down tensions after heated clashes. While Beijing and Washington have been improving military dialogue and communications, the same cannot be said about Beijing and Manila. This dearth of security talks is risky. Manila was a no-show at the 19th Western Pacific Naval Symposium held in Qingdao last April. It also snubbed Beijing's Xiangshan Forum last September. In contrast, the U.S., Japan, and ASEAN countries, among others, were present at these gatherings. It remains to be seen whether a joint coastguard committee would be restored. A proposal for direct hotlines between the foreign ministries and presidential offices of both sides was also pitched, but with no action to follow up. The 10th BCM was convened last January 16 in Xiamen and both sides agreed to keep the provisional arrangement reached over Ayungin Shoal last July.\nRegrettably, domestic politics is complicating diplomacy. This is especially so as the past and incumbent presidents quarrel. Past deals with China entered by the previous Duterte government, including a so-called \"gentleman's agreement\" to keep the status quo in the flashpoint, were vilified for allegedly jeopardizing the country's position. Duterte was criticized for allegedly downplaying a 2016 arbitration award favorable to Manila in return for economic concessions. The current Marcos administration is projecting that it is better at securing the country's interests in the ongoing conflict.\nTo his credit, Duterte got Filipino fishermen renewed access to the Scarborough Shoal, upgraded infrastructure in the Spratlys, invested in modernizing the country's military and coast guard and raised the arbitral award in two UN General Assembly sessions without needlessly antagonizing China. At present, Marcos, while getting much praise, is in a tight spot. China intensified its presence in the Philippines' western EEZ, interfered with resupply missions to Second Thomas Shoal, and challenged patrols in Scarborough Shoal. China's \"monster\" coast guard ship (CCG 5901) faced off with PCG's largest vessel, BRP Teresa Magbanua, in Sabina, and the latter was forced to leave the contested feature after being rammed by a CCG ship. Yet, for all the noise and posturing, the current Marcos administration also sought de-escalation.\nNoise and posturing, but talking \nA provisional arrangement for Philippine troop rotation and resupply (RORE) mission to Second Thomas Shoal reached with China last July. So far, it seems to be holding. Cases of disruption in RORE sorties to the low tide elevation were not heard since the deal was made. Manila may want to have a similar arrangement in other hotspots like Sabina (Escoda) and Scarborough Shoals. In Sabina, the Philippines may want a guarantee that China will not build structures or control the feature similar to what it did in Scarborough after a tense standoff in 2012. Sabina lies between Palawan and Second Thomas, and a rival claimant that controls it can interdict resupply efforts to Filipino marines stationed in BRP Sierra Madre in Second Thomas. Chinese control of Sabina is unacceptable to Manila as this feature is very close to Palawan, the country's main western island facing the South China Sea. Manila worries that the dumping of dead or damaged corals in Sabina, which was reported last May, portends possible Chinese interest in occupying the low-lying feature. The Philippines may want China to accept the constant presence of its PCG vessel in Sabina with the understanding that Manila will not ground a ship similar to what it did in Second Thomas in 1999 or build a permanent structure in the shoal. China has not built any structure in Scarborough despite having a near-constant presence in the feature since 2012.\nIn Scarborough Shoal, Manila wants its local fishermen to have unfettered access inside the lagoon, where there are more fish. It may be open to discussing possible joint fisheries management with China, including an agreement on closed fishing season, catch limits, and marine species prohibited from being captured. The 2016 arbitration ruling acknowledged that the shoal is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishers. Duterte, in 2016, considered declaring it a marine sanctuary. Manila may also want to resume or keep its government presence in Scarborough through sea and air patrols. It may also want to keep delivering provisions, such as food and fuel, to its fishermen operating in the area.\nThe maricreated_at row has become a topic of concern for media in the Philippines. It has higher issue salience compared to other coastal states like Indonesia, Malaysia, or Brunei. Unlike China or Vietnam, the Philippine government does not have control over its mass media as the more popular outlets are privately owned. The domestic media is expected to keep a watchful eye on choppy waters and expose inaction or lapses by the government in defending Philippine interests in its waters. However, demands for transparency to ensure that the country's interests are not being compromised have to be tamed, as most diplomatic negotiations are done discreetly outside the public limelight. Thus, trust in the leadership that will deal with Beijing is important.\nThis year marks the 50th anniversary of Philippines-China diplomatic ties. It will be a pity to make the maricreated_at row the centerpiece of that milestone. This goes against the interests and aspirations of their peoples and economies. In this Year of the Wooden Snake, the two neighbors should crawl out of the dangerous pit and avoid slithering into conflict. Better diplomacy and statesmanship should rise.\n - This article was published by China-US Focus and draws from the author's prior work published in Italian text: Pitlo, Lucio III B. \"Manila Morirebbe Per Gli Scogli Ma Non Per Taiwan.\" Limes (Rivista Italiana di Geopolitica) No. 10 (November 2024). 223-231.\n"

    "text": "\nThe US and its allies should limit China’s access to technology and data to curb its expansionist ambitions in the South China Sea through coordinated military deterrence, a former US security official said on Monday.\n“It would be better to constrain and temper Xi Jinping’s ambitions now through robust coordinated military deterrence and through strict limits on China’s access to technology, capital and data controlled by our countries,” said Matthew Forbes Pottinger, a former deputy National Security adviser to US President Donald J. Trump.\n“That is better than waiting until Xi Jinping has taken fateful and irrevocable steps, such as attacking Taiwan that would lead to a war between superpowers,” he said in a video message at a parliamentary intelligence-security forum in Manila.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately reply to a Viber message seeking comment.\nChina claims almost the entire South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam. It asserts its sovereignty claim through an armada of coast guard ships, despite a United Nations-backed court ruling in 2016 that voided its claim for being illegal.\nMr. Pottinger said countries should speak out against Beijing’s actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors. “It’s important to speak openly and loudly if we are to prevent Xi Jinping from making grave miscalculations.”\nThe Philippines has contested China’s sweeping claim in the waterway through diplomatic channels by filing more than 190 diplomatic protests since President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. took office in 2022.\n“Gratuitous efforts to flatter and reassure Beijing are likely to be taken as signs of weakness,” Mr. Pottinger said.\nCountries should also consider banning Chinese-made apps such as TikTok and WeChat to prevent Beijing from conducting what he described as “information warfare” and weaken its “discourse power.”\n“All we need to do is prevent Beijing’s platforms from manipulating our discourse at home, while making it easier for Chinese citizens to communicate safely with one another and with the outside world,” he added.\nWashington is in a “cold war” with Beijing amid its increasing assertiveness in the contested South China Sea, said Carl Timothy Delfeld, chairman at the Hay Seward Economic Security Council.\n‘SILK CURTAIN’\n“Are we in a second Cold War with China?” he told the forum. “In short, we are. But it’s a very different Cold War than the one with the Soviet Union. We don’t have an ‘iron curtain’ in the Western Pacific. We have what I refer to as a ‘silk curtain.’”\nThe iron curtain was a political, military and ideological boundary that separated the Soviet Union from the West after World War II.\nMr. Delfeld described China’s encroachment of the waterway as a silk curtain due to the risk of conflict in contested areas. “A silk curtain is flammable, meaning there are flash points from the East China Sea to Taiwan and to the Philippines in the South China Sea.”\n“It’s flexible, so it moves to and fro depending on the winds of change, events and alliances, which are constantly shifting,” he added.\nHe said the flow of trade in the South China Sea makes controlling it more difficult. About $3 trillion worth of ship-borne trade passes through the waterway annually.\n“You have trade, you have capital, you have tourism,” he said. “So it’s much more difficult. The challenge is who’s going to control the flow through the silk curtain.”\nManila has used a so-called transparency initiative to raise public awareness and highlight its rights in the disputed waterway while also exposing “unlawful Chinese actions” including aggressive behavior and bullying, Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) Commandant Admiral Ronnie Gil L. Gavan told the same forum.\n“By exposing unlawful and coercive behavior, we prevent intimidation tactics from operating in the shadows,” he said. “We made its reputational cost higher.”\nThe Philippine Coast Guard on Sunday said it had deployed an aircraft to check the “illegal presence” of two Chinese vessels 63 kilometers from the coast of Pangasinan province facing the South China Sea in the country’s north.\nIn a statement, the PCG said its Islander aircraft confirmed the presence of the China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels with bow numbers 3301 and 3104 at 9:30 am on Sunday. “Notably, the CCG vessels did not respond to the radio challenge issued by the PCG,” it added.\nIt said two 44-meter PCG vessels — BRP Cabra and BRP Bagacay — were dispatched to Bolinao, Pangasinan “to address the illegal presence of the China Coast Guard.”\nThe vessels reinforce the Philippine government’s position against the “normalization of illegal patrols” by China within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea.\nThe Philippines has accused China of intimidating Filipino fishermen near Scarborough Shoal and normalizing its “illegal presence” after Beijing sent the monster ship into its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) on Jan. 4.\nChina has repeatedly accused Philippine vessels of encroachment on its territory. Bilateral ties are at their worst in years after repeated confrontations and heated diplomatic rows.\nA United Nations-backed court in the Hague voided China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea in 2016, as it ruled the shoal is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen.\n"

Sunday marked 30 consecutive days of the Chinese coast guard presence in waters off the heavily populated Philippine island of Luzon.\nWhat To Know\nThe Philippines' armed forces said Monday that it was tracking three People's Liberation Army vessels—a nearly 600-foot Renhai-class guided missile cruiser, a Jiangkai II-class frigate and a Fuchi-class replenishment oiler—that were first observed Sunday \"in the vicinity of the West Philippine Sea.\"\nThe West Philippine Sea is Manila's term for the parts of the South China Sea lying within its exclusive economic zone.\nThe ships left the South China Sea and were observed transiting through the Mindoro Strait and heading toward the Sulu Sea to the south of the Philippines, a statement said.\nAlthough maricreated_at law permits innocent passage through these waters, the Chinese ships \"transited without prior diplomatic coordination\" and at an \"unusually slow speed\" of 4 to 5 knots.\n\"This is not consistent with the principles of innocent passage, which requires continuous and expeditious passage and that the vessel should not linger in archipelagic waters longer than necessary,\" the statement added.\nAs of 7:30 a.m. ET Tuesday, the Chinese vessels were about 140 miles south of Basilan, an island province in the far southwest, the Philippine navy told local media.\nWhat People Are Saying\nA spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army, Southern Theater Command said: \"The Chinese naval vessels' passage through the Basilan Strait is in full compliance with the international law and practice.\"\nGeneral Romeo Brawner Jr., Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff, was quoted as saying in a January 31 statement: \"The AFP stands firmly with President Ferdinand R.

    "text": "\nFeb. 4—The United States should provide its ally the Philippines with the type of sound cannons the Chinese coast guard employs to harass Philippine vessels, according to an expert on international relations in the Indo-Pacific.\nChina's coast guard recently deployed a sound cannon, able to blast noise loud enough to cause pain and damage hearing, as part of a harassment campaign targeting Philippine vessels in disputed South China Sea waters.\nThe long-range acoustic device was used Jan. 25 against a Philippine coast guard vessel, according to Philippine navy and coast guard officials quoted by Philippine media.\nThe nation's coast guard did not reply to questions emailed Monday about the incident.\nHowever, Patricio Abinales, a professor at the University of Hawaii's School of Pacific and Asian Studies, recommended the U.S. provide the Philippines with its own sound cannons to deter Chinese vessels pushing deeper and deeper into the country's territorial waters.\n\"This is a game of brinksmanship now,\" he said by email Monday.\nSound cannons are relatively inexpensive, according to Arizona State University engineering professor Braden Allenby.\n\"Over 25 navies around the world currently deploy such devices, and civilian ships may use them to discourage piracy,\" he said in an email Tuesday.\nPolice in the U.S. and elsewhere have such devices, Allenby added.\n\"Whether to deploy them in a confrontation with an aggressive Chinese force is, of course, another matter entirely,\" he said.\nThe Chinese could respond with an array of nonlethal, gray-zone tactics, including irritating gases and chemicals, energy devices, tasers and rubber bullets, Allenby added. Cyber sabotage and disinformation campaigns are also possible, he said.\n\"Moreover, given the behavior of their Russian allies, sabotage of undersea and terrestrial infrastructures, and even assassination, cannot be ruled out,\" he said. \"It would be wise to assume that the Chinese will potentially use whatever they think they can get away with, without triggering a kinetic response by the United States.\"\nThe sound cannon incident occurred near Capones Island, just off the coast of the Philippines' main island of Luzon and about 20 miles from Subic Bay, once home to America's largest overseas naval base, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported Jan. 27.\nThe device was apparently used to deter the Philippine coast guard vessel BRP Cabra from approaching a Chinese ship, a Philippine coast guard spokesman told reporters after the incident, according to the newspaper.\nChina had moored the 12,000-ton CCG 5901, the world's largest coast guard vessel, off the island while smaller Chinese vessels moved closer to the coast, said Commodore Jay Tarriela.\nThe Chinese \"monster ship\" retreated that day to 90 miles from the Zambales coast following hourly radio challenges from the BRP Cabra, he said.\nThe use of the sound cannon reflects \"an increase in the aggression of the Chinese Communist Party in the West Philippine Sea,\" Philippine navy spokesman Rear Adm. Roy Trinidad told reporters Tuesday, according to a report on the Philippine Star the next day.\nThe West Philippine Sea, according to Philippine authorities, refers to parts of the South China Sea within the Philippines exclusive economic zone.\nBeijing has reclaimed land and built military facilities in disputed South China Sea territory. Its claims are challenged by neighboring countries, including Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nChina has employed so-called gray zone tactics that fall short of warfare against the Philippines in disputed waters.\nFor example, the Philippines has accused China of ramming its vessels, pointing lasers at crew and buzzing fishermen with helicopters.\nIn December, diplomats from the U.S., the Philippines and Japan met in Tokyo and reiterated their expectation that Beijing comply with a 2016 international court ruling against its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea.\n© 2025 the Stars and Stripes.

    "text": "\n The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) once again drove away the so-called monster ship of the China Coast Guard (CCG) that was caught sailing closer to the shores of Zambales province.\nThe PCG's 97-meter patrol ship BRP Teresa Magbanua 'initially spotted' the 165-meter CCG 5901 '54 nautical miles from shore' of Zambales last Feb. 2, according to a statement from Commodore Jay Tarriela, PCG's spokesman on West Philippine Sea issues.\nThe PCG vessel 'pushed back' CCG 5901, said to be the world's largest coast guard ship, 'to approximately 120 nautical miles,' he noted.\nDespite being driven away, the CCG maintained it was 'performing law enforcement duties on the jurisdictional waters of the People's Republic of China in accordance with law,' said a radio announcement in both English and Chinese heard inside the Teresa Magbanua.\nIt added: 'The Arbitral Award for the South China Sea arbitration is illegal and invalid, that China neither accepts nor legitimizes.'\nThe radio announcement from CCG 5901 went on, 'China firmly upholds its territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests in the South China Sea, and (advocates) to manage maricreated_at differences through dialog and cooperation.'\nIt also called on BRP Teresa Magbanua to preserve 'peace and stability in the South China Sea and maintain mutual trust and cooperation between our countries with concrete actions.'\nThrough a female PCG officer onboard the patrol ship, Teresa Magbanua replied to the radio challenge of CCG 5901 by saying it was 'sailing within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ), approximately 117 nautical miles northwest of Capones Point in Zambales, Philippines.'\n'You do not possess any legal authority to patrol within the Philippines' (EEZ),' she added, pursuant to Republic Act 12064 or the Maricreated_at Zones Act, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the 2016 Arbitral Award.\nThe landmark ruling upheld the Philippines' sovereign rights over the West Philippine Sea covered by its 200-nautical mile EEZ, at the same created_at junked China's claim over the entire South China Sea.\n'While CCG-5901 has expressed intentions to promote peace and stability through mutual trust and cooperation over the radio, the actions of the China Coast Guard starkly contradict these assertions, revealing a hidden agenda that jeopardizes efforts toward a peaceful resolution,' Tarriela said.\nHe added the PCG would continue to 'safeguard the welfare of Filipino fishermen, uphold our maricreated_at rights, enforce international law and foster de-escalation of tensions in our waters.'\nHe noted the CCG has been patrolling in the West Philippine Sea for 30 days as of Feb. 2.\nWarships passing through\nIn Zamboanga City, the Philippine Navy and Coast Guard escorted out three Chinese warships, including a cruiser-guided missile class, that were spotted Monday afternoon transiting off the coast of this city and Basilan.\nThe Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom) confirmed it was closely monitoring and tracking the movement of the three Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) navy warships that entered Philippine waters.\nMaj. Orlando Ayllon Jr., spokesman for Westmincom, said the PLA warships were first monitored last Sunday in the vicinity of the West Philippine Sea and were spotted between the coast of Zamboanga and Basilan about noon Monday by the Litoral Monitoring Station (LMS) of the Naval Forces Western Mindanao.\nThe Westmincom said the warships were a Jianki Class Frigate II, a Renhai Class Cruiser Guided Missile and Type 903 Fuchi Class Replenishment Oiler traversing the international sea lane in the Sibutu Passage toward Basilan Strait.\nAccording to Ayllon, while the transit of vessels of other nation-states is allowed subject to their compliance with national and international laws and procedures governing innocent passage, the Chinese warships did not coordinate with Philippine authorities and Westmincom.\n'The said PLA navy vessels transited without prior diplomatic coordination and maintained unusually slow speed at four to five knots,' Ayllon said.\nThe Westmincom said the movement was not consistent with the principles of innocent passage, which require continuous and expeditious passage and 'the vessels should not linger in archipelagic waters longer than necessary.'\nThe Navy on the LMS and the PCG made repeated radio challenge to the passing Chinese warships on their purpose but there was no immediate response, until later saying the ships were just passing through.\nRegional cooperation\nSpeaker Martin Romualdez yesterday called for stronger regional cooperation, economic resilience and responsible technology governance to address security and economic challenges in the Indo-Pacific region, to deter China's further aggression.\nThe leader of the 306-member House of Representatives said geopolitical tensions, economic vulnerabilities and technological disruptions in the region require a coordinated global response.\n'We gather at a critical moment when the Indo-Pacific - home to 4.7 billion people, or 60 percent of the global population and a driving force of global trade and innovation - is both a region of immense opportunity and unprecedented challenges,' the Leyte first district congressman said.\nRomualdez made the remarks before incumbent and former international lawmakers, diplomats, security experts and technology experts who attended the Parliamentary Intelligence-Security Forum (PI-SF) held in Manila.\n'It is a region where economic dynamism coexists with intensifying strategic competition, geopolitical tensions and non-traditional security threats. These realities demand our collective action and resolve as parliamentarians and policymakers,' he said.\nThe PI-SF, a global platform that convenes legislators to discuss intelligence, security and economic threats, has played a key role in strengthening multilateral cooperation against emerging global challenges.\nThe global threats posed by Beijing by way of coercion, corruption and military expansion were topics at the Philippine security forum, the main critics of whom were former US congressman Robert Pittenger, Sen. Bill Cassidy and former deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger.\nThe US officials accused the Communist Party of China of destabilizing the global order through economic subversion, political infiltration and military expansionism.\n"

His predecessor, Joe Biden, had moved to strengthen an arc of security alliances in the region to counter China’s increasingly assertive actions.\nTwo U.S. Air Force B-1 bomber aircraft and three Philippine Air Force FA-50 fighter jets joined the brief patrol and training, which involved practicing how to intercept a hostile aircraft, Philippine air force spokesperson Maria Consuelo Castillo said in a news briefing.\nIt was not immediately known if the joint patrol encountered any challenge from Chinese forces guarding the Scarborough Shoal.\n\"The exercises focused on enhancing operational coordination, improving air domain awareness and reinforcing agile combat employment capabilities between the two air forces,” the Philippine Air Force said.\nIn August last year, two Chinese air force aircraft flew close then fired flares in the path of a Philippine air force plane on routine patrol over the Scarborough Shoal in actions that were strongly condemned and protested by the Philippine government, military officials said.\nAll those aboard the Philippine air force NC-212i turbo-prop transport plane were unharmed, the Philippine military said.\nThe Southern Theater Command of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army said then that a Philippine air force aircraft “illegally” entered the airspace above the shoal and disrupted training activities by Chinese forces. It warned the Philippines to “stop its infringement, provocation, distortion and hyping-up.\"\nThe Philippine military chief, Gen. Romeo Brawner, said at the created_at that the incident “posed a threat to Philippine air force aircraft and its crew, interfered with lawful flight operations in airspace within Philippine sovereignty and jurisdiction and contravened international law and regulations governing safety of aviation.\"\nChina and the Philippines have had increasingly alarming faceoffs in the shoal, which is called Bajo de Masinloc by the Philippines and Huangyan Island by China.\n\"We are always prepared for any contingency, it’s part of the training,” Castillo said when asked if the allied forces had prepared to address any challenge by Chinese aircraft.\n\"It already happened before and, as I have said, whatever the coercive, aggressive actions of any foreign party, the Philippine air force will not be deterred to perform its mandate,” Castillo said.\nThe U.S. military has reported encountering such dangerous maneuvers by Chinese air force planes in the past over the disputed waters, where it has deployed fighter jets and navy ships to promote freedom of navigation and overflight.\nChina has bristled at U.S. military deployments in the disputed region, saying these have endangered regional security.\nAside from China and the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan have overlapping territorial claims in the busy sea passage, a key global trade and security route, but hostilities have particularly flared in the past two years between Chinese and Philippine coast guard and navy forces in the Scarborough Shoal and another fiercely contested atoll, the Second Thomas Shoal.\nWashington has repeatedly warned that it’s obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if Philippine forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea.\n"

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:\nAs a video of a man who claims to be a U.S. arm recruiter has gone viral online, some online users questioned his identity.\nBut a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Recruiting Command told AFCL that the man in the video is an active U.S. army recruiter.\nThe video was shared on X in November 2024.\nThe 35-second video shows a man who claims that he is a Chinese-American U.S. army recruiter saying he would not fight against China if a war broke out between the two countries.\nThe video's subtitles identify the man as Max Zhang. In the clip, he is seen wearing a U.S. military uniform while introducing himself in Mandarin as a native of the Chinese town of Shenyang.\nAt one point in the video, Zhang can be heard saying: \"If war did break out, I would certainly quit the U.S. military. I wouldn't join the Chinese army because I'm a US national. I would stay neutral.\"\nThe video went viral online, especially among Chinese social media users, but some questioned the video's authenticity and claimed that Zhang was not actually in the U.S. army.\nBut according to the U.S. Department of Defense, the man in the video is a U.S. army recruiter.\n\"Staff Sgt. Zhang is an Army recruiter. The video you are referencing is not an official U.S. Army multi-media product,\" Madison Bonzo, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Recruiting Command told AFCL.\nThe possibility of a U.S.-China conflict is widely debated. Some argue China's growing power may escalate tensions in the Indo-Pacific. Others believe war is avoidable due to economic interdependence, nuclear deterrence, and the catastrophic risks of modern warfare, emphasizing the need for careful diplomacy.\nRecent U.S. export controls on China's tech sector and China's assertiveness in the South China Sea have raised tensions, prompting the U.S. to strengthen alliances and its military presence.\nPublic opinion in the United States is divided: 60% see war as unlikely, 26% consider it likely, and 11% view it as inevitable.\nTranslated by Shen Ke.

    "text": "\nA TRADE war launched by the United States against Canada, Mexico and China will have consequences for other countries worldwide including the Philippines, analysts said.\nThe Department of Trade and Industry said the country's exports could also be affected and that the government would be looking to engage with the US on mutually beneficial solutions, including possible preferential agreements.\n\"The extent of the impact will depend on a number of factors, including the final tariff rate and the response of other countries,\" Trade Secretary Cristina Roque said. \nUS President Donald Trump on Saturday announced duties of 25 percent on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10 percent on imports from China, claiming that the three countries needed to do more to curb the flow of narcotics and illegal immigrants.\nCanada and Mexico quickly retaliated and China is expected to follow.\nMoody's Analytics economist Sarah Tan said that \"while these are not direct tariff hikes on the Philippines, the country will not be completely isolated from the ongoing trade tensions.\"\nShe said that softer global demand, particularly from the US and China - two of the Philippines' major trading partners - could dampen the country's export performance.\nTan also warned that the \"tariff hikes could cause global interest rate nominalization to slow,\" potentially affecting the strength of the peso and hinder borrowings.\n\"Should demand for Philippine merchandise exports slow, it will hit industrial production and potentially prompt firms to pare back investment plans,\" she added.\nStill, Tan said that the Philippines, given its strong domestic economy, would still be one of the better performers in the region.\n\"As for new tariffs, we don't expect the Philippines to be high up on President Trump's hit list for two reasons,\" she continued.\n\"First, the Philippines' trade deficit with the US is small. Second, the country has an increasingly close defense partnership with the US as the Philippine fishing fleet faces harassment from China in the South China Sea.\"\nRizal Commercial Banking Corp. chief economist Michael Ricafort, meanwhile, also said that strong local demand could support economic growth amid global uncertainties.\nProlonged trade tensions, however, could lead to reduced foreign direct investments and overseas remittances, he added.\nRicafort was skeptical about a push for a Philippines-US free trade deal, saying this may not align with Trump's policies.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-02-04",
    "text": "\nThe Philippine Navy is advancing with its project to acquire Fast Attack Interdiction Crafts with Missiles (FAIC-M) as part of Phase 2 of the Re-Horizon 3 modernization program under the Revised Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Program (RAFPMP). The project outlines the acquisition of 10 new fast attack interdiction crafts equipped with missile systems to enhance the countrys defense and security capabilities in its littoral zones, particularly in the sensitive tri-border areas with Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as in the South China Sea, including the Kalayaan Island Group.\nThis initiative follows the Philippine Navys ongoing efforts to modernize its fleet, which includes the retirement of the Tomas Batilo-class fast attack crafts, a South Korean version of the Chamsuri-class, which have been out of active service since 2021. The acquisition of these new boats, designed to strengthen the Navys effectiveness in rapid interdiction and defense operations, aligns with the broader goals of the modernization program. The new FAIC-M boats are expected to be equipped with advanced systems, including the Rafael Typhoon Mk.30C remote-controlled weapon station armed with a 30mm Mk.44 Bushmaster II autocannon, and the Typhoon MLS-NLOS missile launcher, capable of launching short-range surface-to-surface Spike-NLOS missiles.\nThe acquisition plan, signed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in 2024, allocates a total budget of 16 billion pesos for the procurement of the 10 new boats, an increase from the 10 billion pesos allocated in 2020 for the initial acquisition of nine boats. This budget increase accounts for inflation, as well as the cost of local construction of the boats at the Philippine Navys Naval Shipyard in Cavite, in addition to the increased number of missile systems and spare parts required. Phase 2 of the project is also expected to include the acquisition of weapons, ammunition, and potentially system integration, with separate contracts likely to be signed for the boats, weapons systems, and ammunition.\nDespite the approval of the funding plan, the project was not included in the programmed funding for 2025 under the AFP Modernization Program due to budget cuts. However, there is potential for financing through the Unprogrammed Fund, contingent on additional financial support from the national government. Alternatively, the Philippine Navy may use its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) funding for FY2025, which requires only an initial 10% commitment to initiate the project.\nGiven that the Philippine Navy already operates Shaldag Mk. V fast attack crafts, locally known as the Acero-class fast attack interdiction craft, it is expected that the additional units will follow the same design and be equipped with the same advanced weapon systems. These upgrades will ensure that the Philippine Navys Littoral Combat Force maintains operational readiness and effectively responds to growing security threats in its maricreated_at zones.\n"

CGTN also released a video and article on 2 February criticising, without naming the film, a production that \"distorts history\" and is being screened in the Netherlands. It portrayed \"Xizang's\" 1959 uprising as an attempt to maintain a \"theocratic feudal serfdom\" and claimed the Dalai Lama fled \"Xizang\" after failing to retain power.\nCGTN also alleged that Western forces, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), orchestrated events behind the scenes, using the Dalai Lama as a \"geopolitical tool\" to destabilise China. CGTN and China Daily also published an opinion piece on 1 February, calling the Dalai Lama a \"reactionary force\" and a \"betrayer of the motherland.\"\nSince 2023, state media have increasingly used \"Xizang\" instead of \"Tibet\" in English reports, a shift the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong daily, links to China's sovereignty claims.\nSee also: Briefing: China touts achievements of 'paired assistance' to Tibet  \nBriefing: Xi visits Tibetan temple as US lawmakers meet Dalai Lama (June 2024)\nTaiwan denies entry to 13 Chinese officials for Taipei event\nTaiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), the government agency handling relations with mainland China, said it has denied 13 Chinese officials from entering Taiwan to attend the Taipei Lantern Festival.\nThe 13 officials include Jin Mei, director of Shanghai's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO), who was previously denied entry to the island for the Shanghai-Taipei Twin-City Forum in December last year.\nExplaining the reason for the rejection, MAC Minister Chiu Chui-cheng said the Shanghai TAO delegation's application was \"submitted too late for review\", local newspaper Liberty created_ats reported on 3 February.\nHowever, Chiu also accused Beijing of obstructing China-based Taiwanese businessmen from returning home during the Lunar New Year to attend events organised by the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), highlighting in particular that \"very few\" businessmen based in Shanghai participated in the SEF activities in recent years.\nHe added that such \"malicious obstruction\" will be taken in consideration when approving Taiwan entry applications from local TAO delegations.\nSeparately, Chiu was also asked about the progress of allowing Chinese group tours to Taiwan following Beijing announcing in January the resumption of such tours for residents of Fujian and Shanghai.\nHe highlighted that cross-strait tourism should be handled by the government and not left to the private sector given \"risks\" including past experiences of \"arbitrary\" tourism pause, \"sightseeing chaos\" and \"pushing out tourists from other countries\", government-affiliated Central News Agency (CNA) reported.\nHe added that Taiwan will arrange for talks between the two sides' tourism associations as soon as possible to let cross-strait tourism proceed smoothly.\nSee also: Briefing: Taiwanese YouTubers expose China's United Front work  \nComing up\nChina will be hosting two state visits from 4 February.\nKyrgyzstan President Sadyr Japarov will pay a state visit to China from 4-7 February at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.

    "text": "\nPresident Trump's tariffs hurt China, but his other actions have alienated U.S. allies, giving Beijing an opening to strengthen its global standing.\nAs President Trump was locked in a war of words with the leader of Colombia over the military deportation of migrants, China's ambassador to Colombia declared that relations between Beijing and Bogotá were at their ''best moment'' in decades. \n  Zhu Jingyang, the ambassador, later said that it was a coincidence that he posted his comment on social media last week, a day after Mr. Trump said he would slap tariffs on Colombia. But the public outreach suggested that Beijing saw an opportunity to strengthen its hand in the high-stakes superpower rivalry between China and the United States.\n  Two weeks into the second Trump administration, Mr. Trump's aggressive ''America First'' foreign policy holds both promise and peril for Beijing.\n  The perils have always been clear: more tariffs, and the risk of a wider trade war. This weekend, Mr. Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariffs on goods imported from China, saying the tariffs were a response to China's failure to curb fentanyl exports. He could answer any retaliation from China with even higher levies.\n  But even as Beijing calculates the impact of the tariffs on China's weak economy, it is surely also taking stock of the openings that Mr. Trump's other moves are giving China.\n  Mr. Trump has alienated U.S. allies and partners like Canada and Mexico by imposing steep tariffs on their exports. He has weakened America's global authority by cutting foreign aid and withdrawing from the World Health Organization and the Paris Agreement, a U.N. climate pact.\n  If the second Trump term marks the sunset of Pax Americana, analysts say China will almost certainly use the opportunity to try to reshape the world in its favor. Beijing, which has long accused Washington of using its dominance to contain China's rise, has tried to drive a wedge between the United States and its allies, including the European Union, Japan and Australia.\n  ''The Chinese are well aware of the damage Trump has done and is doing to U.S. credibility and influence globally. In fact, it is unfolding faster than even Beijing expected,'' said Evan S. Medeiros, a professor of Asian studies at Georgetown University who served as an Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n  Mr. Trump's threats to take the Panama Canal and Greenland, as well as to annex Canada as America's 51st state could normalize a world order in which might makes right. That is an approach that is familiar to Beijing, even if Chinese officials rhetorically maintain that it will never seek hegemony or expansion.\n  If the United States strong-arms Panama over its crucial waterway, or forces Denmark to give up the resource-rich territory of Greenland, it sends a signal to China that when it comes to its own claims to the self-governing island of Taiwan and much of the South China Sea, coercion trumps cooperation.\n  ''China was certainly never going to give up Taiwan or the South China Sea, but with President Trump doing what he's doing, China is even more determined to safeguard its interests there, that's for sure,'' said Henry Huiyao Wang, president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing.\n  Mr. Wang said China has been encouraged by the first two weeks of the new administration despite the tariffs and appointment of hawkish advisers such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser.\n  Rather than coming out aggressively to confront China, Mr. Trump has presented himself as someone willing to negotiate and potentially cut a deal with Xi Jinping, China's leader. Mr. Trump has floated the idea of tying tariffs to the fate of TikTok, which he has said should be half-owned by an American company.\n  Another potential area for deal making is Ukraine. Mr. Trump has said China should help end Russia's war in the Eastern European country. China, as Russia's biggest provider of economic and material support, could conceivably pressure President Vladimir V. Putin to come to the negotiation table.\n  ''Trump wants China's help to end the war in Ukraine,'' Mr. Wang said. ''China is one of the best partners for him to do that.''\n  But with so many competing interests, cooperation would be difficult. China has avoided criticizing Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for example, taking the position that Russia has a right to protect its national security. Ukraine will not accept China as a peace broker because of China's pro-Russian position, said Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing. Mr. Putin, on the other hand, will not want to look subordinate to China, he said, while Mr. Trump has ''no real stomach'' to see China lauded for playing a significant role.\n  On the issue of tariffs, Beijing has to decide if it can afford to escalate a trade war with the United States. On Sunday, it vowed to respond to Mr. Trump's tariffs by filing a case with the World Trade Organization and with countermeasures to be specified later.\n  Beijing could hit back with tariffs. A more drastic approach would be for China to engage in ''supply chain warfare'': halting shipments to the United States of materials and equipment critical to U.S. industry. In early December, China stopped the export to the United States of minerals like antimony and gallium, which are needed to manufacture some semiconductors.\n  The risk to China is that a trade war would be more damaging to itself than it would be for the United States. Exports, and the construction of factories to make them, are among the few strengths now in China's economy. As a result, China's trade surplus -- the amount by which its exports exceeded imports -- reached almost $1 trillion last year.\n  China has also not yet said how it will respond to a potentially farther-reaching provision in the fine print of Mr. Trump's executive order on Saturday: the elimination of duty-free handling for packages worth up to $800 per day for each American. Factories all over China have shifted in recent years to e-commerce shipments directly to American homes, so as to bypass the many tariffs collected on clothing and other goods that are imported and sold through American stores.\n  In the race for global influence, some argue that the Trump administration's move to freeze most foreign aid, which has disrupted aid programs around the world, has already benefited China.\n  In regions like Southeast Asia, where attitudes toward the United States have hardened because of Washington's support for Israel in the Gaza war, the halt in funding has raised questions about American reliability.\n  ''China needs to do nothing in the meancreated_at, and yet, somehow, net-net, look like the good guy in all of this,'' said Jeremy Chan, a senior analyst on China at the Eurasia Group.\n  Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, defended the importance of soft power to America's standing.\n  ''If you don't get involved in the world and you don't have programs in Africa, where China is trying to buy the whole continent, we're making a mistake,'' he said last month.\n\n\n\nGraphic\n \nPHOTOS: President Trump's freeze on foreign aid has benefited China by raising questions about American reliability.

    "text": "\nClick to view video (available for 30 days from publication date): \nSpeech to text transcript:1\nYes, I think that further such ministerial engagements are planned. The Secretary of State for Business and Trade and the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero are both, I think, due to attend similar discussions. I completely disagree with the noble Lord's characterisation of the Chancellor's visit to China. As I said, we must and will continue to engage with our international partners in trade and investment, and that includes engaging with China. \nWe cannot ignore the fact that China is the second-largest economy worldwide and our fourth-largest trading partner, with exports supporting close to half a million jobs in the UK. We need to help British businesses export around the world, and that includes to China. On human rights and the parliamentary sanctions that the noble Lord talks about, the Chancellor did raise those-absolutely-but she believes that, unless we open that dialogue, we will be unable to raise the concerns that we have. Lord West of Spithead Were there any discussions at all about the Chinese merchant fleet and the use of certain ships by the Russians as the shadow fleet-and also the #7 trillion worth of trade that goes through the South China Sea and is threatened by Chinese actions? Lord Livermore Of course, I was not in the room, Of course, I was not in the room, so I cannot entirely judge exactly whether those issues were raised-but certainly the Chancellor raised important issues of national security. She raised the concerns that the UK Government have about China, and Russia's illegal war in Ukraine, so the issues that my noble friend raises would have been very much at the forefront of their discussions. Does the Minister understand that the impact of fining our car companies huge sums for making vehicles that people want to buy, because they are not making sufficient electric cars, has the effect of handing our car industry to the Chinese, who are flooding the market with cheap electric cars-leading to the destruction of jobs throughout the Midlands and elsewhere? I absolutely understand the point that the noble Lord raises. There are different priorities that we need to balance as we make policy and move forward. As he says, there is the industrial strategy priority of making sure that we have a competitive and thriving car industry in the UK, and there is also the objective of making sure that we achieve our net-zero objectives. Transport is a major component of that, so electric vehicles will play a very important part as we move towards our net-zero targets. Absolutely, we have to balance those objectives, and I am very aware of the issues that the noble Lord raises. My Lords, the Minister told us that the Chancellor spoke about the sanctioning of Members of your Lordships' House and the human rights implications of that appalling situation. Can he tell us whether there were any other discussions in the human rights context in the light of China's appalling record on human rights? I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her question. Yes, I reassure her that there absolutely were. The UK Government will stand firm on human rights in China and will continue to raise concerns at the highest level of the Chinese Government. In all our engagements with the Chinese Government, we continue to challenge them robustly on human rights violations and continue to raise our concerns at the highest level of the Government. The Prime Minister did so at his meeting at the G20 with President Xi and the Chancellor also raised concerns in a number of areas, including the case of British national Jimmy Lai, the restrictions on rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, human rights abuses and forced labour. Given that climate change knows no boundaries and that there is a change of policy taking place in the USA in that regard, does the Minister see the possibility of us having more dialogue with China in this context as a way forward? I am grateful to my noble friend for his question. Our journey towards net zero will remain vital for our energy security in this country, as well as our economic growth, so that will absolutely continue to play an important part in our economic policy. China will of course be part of that in how we move forward together, both in terms of its own journey towards net zero and in how it can help our journey towards net zero. To ask His Majesty's Government what steps\n"

    "created_at": "2025-02-04",
    "text": "\nPM Keir Starmer is determined to sign Chagos deal despite security concerns \nKeir Starmer’s planned Chagos deal will help China expand its stranglehold over international trade routes and affect the global economy by threatening Western shipping, a damning new report has warned.\nBeijing would begin by using spy ships posing as fishing vessels to eavesdrop on the crucial US-UK military base on Diego Garcia, before installing disguised military instillations on adjoining islands to hamper its effectiveness.\nCrucially, there is also a real possibility that the agreement will alter the balance of power in Mauritius itself to favour Beijing, putting into question the validity of any conditions secured by the UK..\nOfficials in Mauritius now say they are “optimistic” that the controversial deal will be signed on March 12- Mauritius Independence Day - following a “cordial” conversation between the PM and and his Mauritian counterpart Navin Ramgoolam last week.\nBut its spectre has caused alarm bells in Washington DC, with President Donald Trump fearful that it will allow China to increase its military leverage in the area.\nIf passed, the deal would involve the base on Diego Garcia being leased to Britain for 99 years at a reported cost of £9 billion to maintain a UK and US military presence.\nLast night, a damning report by the Council on Geostrategy think tank laid out in chilling detail the full scale of the Chinese threat.\n“In this era of a deteriorating world order, control of maricreated_at trade routes and strategic waterways has become a focal point of competition and the Indian Ocean is at the heart of this shift,’ said regional expert Jennifer Parker, of Australian National University’s National Security College.\n“This centres on control of sea lanes, which handle two-thirds of global oil shipments and one-third of bulk cargo.\"\nChina has invested heavily in ports and airports across the region, includes over £1.2 million in Chinese foreign direct investment in Mauritius in 2022 alone, she said, as well as a a 20-year loan for the construction of Mauritius International Airport.\nShe added: “While Mauritius appears more closely aligned with India, which would oppose Chinese access due to its own strategic interests, a shift in the balance of power resulting from the UK's handover could create an opportunity for greater Chinese influence. “\nThe danger of that shift, experts warn, is that China does not recognise the validity of inconvenient international agreements. This was demonstrated by the way Beijing violated the Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong by mercilessly prosecuting pro-democracy campaigners.\nAn aerial view of Diego Garcia. )\nChina's Maricreated_at militia and fishing bats will spy on the base \nBritish Chagossians say the deal will not address their grievances \nOnce Mauritius is turned politically, we should expect swift action from Beijing,, warned Peter Dutton Senior Fellow, Paul Tsai China Centre.\nDiego Garcia is \"a vital geographic bulwark against the decline of global order. To leave a power vacuum for Beijing to fill -even by abandoning the Chagos Islands other than Diego Garcia - would seriously weaken Britain and America’s capacity to employ the power necessary to keep order in the region in accordance with international law, and to support allies and friends such as Australia, India, Malaysia, and Singapore“ he said\nAnd China would begin by using the pretext of fishing rights offered by Mauritius.\n“For decades, China has used fishing ships as an extension of its military,” warned Grant Rafferty, Parliamentary Researcher at the House of Commons.\n“Known as the Maricreated_at Militia, their role has only expanded as Beijing has pursued aggressive operations around the South China Sea.”\nHe added: “The ships operate as commercial fisheries -providing plausible deniability - but double up as mini spy ships providing vast amounts of data to the People’s Liberation Army from the location of submarines to the activities at ports.”\nShould China be granted access to develop the other islands economically, we could see “innocuous infrastructure to be built packed with military surveillance equipment aimed directly at the base”, he warned.\nIn 2018 it emerged that confidential data on the IT network of the Chinese-built African Union headquarters in Ethiopia had been being siphoned off to Shanghai for more than six years.\nKeir Starmer justifies his dogged determination to secure a deal over Chagos by pointing to a 2019 ruling by the International Court of Justice, which viewed the expulsion of Chagossians from the islands by the UK in 1968 as ilegal, and called for its decolonisation.\nBut the ruling was non-binding, and while the Conservative Government began negotiations with Mauritius, they were soon abandoned over security threats.\nAnd handing sovereignty to Mauritius, a country more than 2,000 mies away which has never owned them, does not even address the grievance, said shadow national security minister Alicia Kearns MP.\n“The ICJ ruling is based on the expulsion of the Chagossians in 1968. It does not address the current reality in which no agreement exists amongst Chagossians for Mauritian sovereignty,’ she said.\nYet emboldened Mauritius has already passed a law threatening ten years of imprisonment to anyone disputing Mauritian sovereignty over the islands.\n“Chagossians who dispute Mauritian sovereignty could face prison if they return to their homeland after a deal is concluded,” she said.\n“Effectively, the Government is offering to pay eye-watering sums of money to Mauritius, which threatens imprisonment to Chagossians who dispute their claim, while ignoring many Chagossian voices because of a non-binding decision at the ICJ.”\n"

    "text": "\nCHINA is an important partner, and relations between Singapore and the great Asian power presently are very positive. Dubbed an \"all-round high-quality future-oriented partnership\", the two governments cooperate in many areas and, at end-2024, upgraded their bilateral free trade agreement to facilitate greater market access.\n This is a politics that matters to business -- both larger companies and also small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) benefit. There is a two-way flow, too. Chinese corporations increasingly base themselves here, as do individual mainlanders -- ranging from tycoon investors and professionals, to students and everyday service staff.\n This year marks the 35th anniversary of official ties, and some call for relations to escalate further. I write this at Chinese New Year, a created_at when our multiracial society appears especially Chinese. Singapore is among only a handful of countries that celebrate the festival as a public holiday and, other than China, is the only independent state with a majority of ethnic Chinese.\n A concept of \"common destiny\" has been promoted by China for Asean. There is every reason for Singapore to foster better understanding and develop close partnerships for mutual benefit. But some remain ambivalent to the concept. \n Indeed, this may be the wrong created_at for grand visions like common destiny. Among neighbours and even close friends, there have been past differences and, in a turbulent world, the present positive state of relations should not be taken for granted.\n Increasing engagement and cooperationYes, cooperation between China and Singapore is longstanding. From Deng Xiaoping's visit in 1978, a long list of projects continues into the present, with our current 4G leadership working not only with Beijing but in a number of provinces, such as Shandong and Jiangsu. This allows insight into the Chinese market and governance, which is important when its economy is experiencing slower growth and policy interventions can have mixed impacts. \n Externally, tariffs and bans on technology threaten to cut China off from critical supply chains. Doomsayers about China are wrong, but the double-digit growth of earlier decades is unlikely to return. Investors will recalibrate.\n Still, Singaporeans remain engaged. There is appreciation of China's immense market, that it remains an efficient production base and leads in new sectors like electric vehicles and artificial intelligence. News of DeepSeek's app highlights the capability to disrupt at steep discounts.\n Perhaps the critical factor for China is the return of Donald Trump as president of the United States.\n Tariffs, temperament and tacticsTariffs will rise. But, thus far, not to the 60 per cent levels that Trump threatened. But Murphy's laws apply -- that if things can go bad, they will. They may even double -- that is, bad things can get even worse. \n Recall that it was Trump who first slapped unilateral tariffs on China during his first term in office. Recall, too, that his initial meeting with President Xi Jinping was positive, After the two first met at Mar-a-Lago in April 2017, Trump tweeted, \"Tremendous goodwill and friendship was formed\".\n Sharp changes, rather than consistency, are part of Trump's temperament. Indeed, being unpredictable seems to be a tactic. That is a stark change from the Biden administration's efforts to create \"guard rails\" to make the fraught relationship less prone to misunderstanding and brinksmanship. \n At present, Trump has not demanded that third countries choose either to be with China or the US. But that could happen (or not) as soon as his next tweet. \n Regional trustA smaller but still real factor arises from regional views about China. Many countries court it for trade and investments. Singapore and some Asean nations have also waived visa requirements to attract more China tourists.\n Yet, the level of trust is not commensurate. An elite opinion survey by the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute consistently shows this pattern. Why? \n One title issue is the sharp tensions with the Philippines over rocks and \"maricreated_at features\" in the South China Sea. Whatever the legal merits, the broadcast images have hurt the idea that China might be a benevolent big power. \n Singapore cherishes its autonomy and what the Philippines or even the US thinks does not determine its ties with China. At the same created_at, however, Singapore's interest is to remain open and inclusive, engaging all partners. \n At a year-opening event for the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan emphasised, \"We need to maintain an omnidirectional, balanced, and productive and constructive engagement with all powers -- big and middle.\"\n While sovereign, if distrust of China grows markedly, Singapore will need to bear in mind our wish to be omnidirectional.\n Consider why this year marks the 60th year of Singapore's independence but only the 35th year of official ties with Beijing. That considerable delay was because Singapore's founding prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, decided to be the last Asean country to forge official relations with China. \n This did not give our neighbours the final decision. But Lee astutely recognised sensitivities about ties to communist China held by Indonesia and many other countries who had fought communist movements, and the need to balance relations with key partners.\n Influence and perceptionWithin Singapore, there are concerns, too, that Beijing might impact events and shift opinions through social media and campaigns of influence. Some feel such fears are overstated or retort that others, especially the US, play similar games. \n But China, like almost no other country, can amplify its influence among the majority of citizens who are ethnically Chinese as well as mainlanders based in Singapore, even after they have changed nationalities. With elections due in Singapore this year, this will be carefully monitored.\n History illuminates such risks. In the independence period, united-front tactics using Chinese language and cultural organisations were deployed to agitate and cause instability within our then nascent nation. Consequently, the perception was that Singapore was at risk of becoming a base for China to spread communism.\n Leaving old ideological fears aside, even today some still perceive that Singapore is a Chinese city and part of China. \n When the American Senate questioned TikTok chief executive officer Chew Shou Zi about whether he is a Chinese citizen, he emphasised that he is Singaporean. Yet, his answer was not taken as definitive and reassuring. \n Another perception is about \"Singapore washing\" -- that Chinese companies and investors base themselves here purely for camouflage, rather than as a legitimate choice for business and family. \n To be seen as one of China's many cities is not in Singapore's interests. Remember past incidents when overseas parcels had occasionally been addressed, \"Singapore, China\". We can laugh, but such labels offend our hope to be understood as independent and sovereign -- and now marking our 60th year as such.\n There are many more things the two countries should do together, and the current relationship can be further enhanced. But I for one am uncertain about embracing the idea of sharing a common destiny with China, or indeed any other country (unless, of course, that flowery term is applied to all partners). \n To be omnidirectional, Singapore should be a global hub in Asia, open to and engaged with all. Such politics matters to business.\n Happy Chinese New Year.\n The writer is chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs\n\nGraphic\n \nA concept of \"common destiny\" has been promoted by China for Asean.

    "text": "\nEVENT DATE: February 4, 2025\nTYPE: NEWS PROGRAM\nSPEAKER: REP. MARK ALFORD (R-MO)\nBARTIROMO:  Joining me now is Missouri Congressman Mark Alford. Congressman, good to see you. Thanks very much for being here. What's your reaction to the deal that President Trump just did with Mexico and Canada?  \nREP. MARK ALFORD (R-MO):  Look, these are huge wins for President Trump, and I'm so happy that he is back behind that resolute desk to do big things for America. As Peter Navarro said yesterday from the White House, this is a drug war. This is not a trade war. And I think this response really shows Trump's measures that he's going to take against CCP, Communist China, Mexico and Canada, if they don't straighten up and stop the deadly fentanyl from flowing into our country and killing 300 American citizens a day. This has got to stop.  \nBARTIROMO:  By the way, that's exactly what I said yesterday. It's a drug war, not a trade war, and I understand what's behind it, because he's trying to stop the drugs coming into the country. But what about in 30 days? What kind of response or progress does he need to see to keep those tariffs at bay? Or are they going to actually get instituted in 30 days?  \nALFORD:  Maria, we are already seeing this when the President of Mexico agrees to send thousands of troops to the Mexican border to stop people from coming into our sovereign nation. That is a huge step. It's something that President Biden should have done when he was in office, instead of letting 12 million illegal aliens into our great nation.   \nBARTIROMO:  Yes. And what about China? What are your thoughts on this tariff war now that's underway between the U.S. and China?  \nALFORD:  Look, as some of the administration says, this is going to cause a little bit of pain. This happened back when President Trump was in office the first created_at, the tariffs that affected our farming community. We made up those losses to our farming community with the commodity credit corporation under the USDA, we will find the money to make this right, but this is going to have a little bit of pain, but in the long term, it is going to mean that fewer of our citizens die and that we end up winning this war on fentanyl.   \n      Look, let's look at, let's look at what Trump has done just in the first two weeks. Mexico, escaped, Panama escaped, Canada escaped, Venezuela escaped. The boarding crossings -- border crossings are down 93 percent.   \nBARTIROMO:  Right.   \nALFORD:  The FBI purge is underway. All these wins that are under Trump's belt in only two weeks.  \nBARTIROMO:  Well, look, I question whether or not Xi Jinping is actually going to take this to the mat with all of this, because I think he's deeply worried about the economy there. It's much weaker than people understand, given the property sell off, as well as his own health issues. So I don't know how far Xi Jinping is going to take that. Maybe President Trump knows that. This is a game of a chess, and who blinks first on U.S., China. There are a lot of things that the U.S. could be hitting back on China, given its bad behavior over the last several decades, in terms of intellectual property theft and then some (ph).  \nALFORD:  Well, you're exactly right. I think China is one of the biggest threats to the survivability United States of America. We could still be at war with them by 2027, 2028 over Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act. We are committed to help in Taiwan's self-defense. I believe, 65 percent of the world's goods shipped through the South China Sea and the Straits of Taiwan. And if they are successful with cutting those shipments off, it would dive us, it would plunge us into a depression, I think, deeper than the Great Depression. So we have a stake in fending off China and showing them that we're not going to be jacked with.   \nBARTIROMO:  Yes, let me move on to the budget issues. House Republicans on the Budget Committee will reportedly not be able to advance a reconciliation bill out of the committee this week, missing House Speaker Johnson's deadline, schedule deadline, lawmakers hung up on spending cuts. One source telling Fox News Digital, the ideas put forth that last week's conference completely missed the mark and actually would increase deficits. And I reported, as our guests told us, that they went in there looking for $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion in spending cuts, and they couldn't come up with more than 300 billion. So where are the offsets Congressman to paying for all of this lofty agenda?  \nALFORD:  Well, look, we've made an agreement with President Trump. If we're going to raise the debt ceiling, which I think we're going to have to do, we are going to have to find the cuts in the budget over 10 years, but initially, starting with about 250 billion a year. We are going to do that.   \n      Look at what's happened already, DOGE has gone in and found a billion dollars a day in cuts. And so with the help of DOGE, I think Congress, the Appropriations Committee can go in there, under the leadership of Tom Cole and others, and find the cuts necessary. Jason Smith, Chairman of Ways and Means, is doing the same thing. We are going to get this done. We have a continuing resolution, though, which runs out March 14th. We have that up against us, and we have to do our funding for 2026, and we have to raise the debt ceiling. This is kind of the perfect storm, and we're going to have to put our nose to the grindstone on this.  \nBARTIROMO:  All right, we'll be watching your work, sir. Thanks so much for being here.  \nALFORD:  Thank you.   \nBARTIROMO:  Congressman Mark Alford joining us.   \n      END   \n"

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:\nThe Canadian navy's Halifax-class frigate HMCS Ottawa has completed a four-day friendly visit to Cambodia where, as with all other foreign warships, it was not given access to the China-developed Ream naval base.\nThe frigate is on a mission to \"promote peace, stability, and the rules-based international order\" in the Indo-Pacific region, known as Operation Horizon.\nLast month, it conducted joint exercises with the U.S. navy in the South China Sea and sailed near the Scarborough shoal, a hotspot of tension between China and the Philippines.\nIt also took part in La Perouse 25, a French-led multinational exercise in waters near the Indonesian archipelago.\nOn its first visit to Cambodia, HMCS Ottawa, with 240 crew docked from Feb.1 to Feb. 4 at the Sihanoukville Autonomous Port, 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Ream base where two Chinese corvettes are the only foreign warships allowed access.\nThe U.S. has expressed concerns about the lack of transparency around China's development of the base and whether it will in future serve as a de-facto foreign base for the Chinese navy, on the doorstep of the disputed South China Sea.\nThe Canadian ship's visit was aimed at \"strengthening solidarity and friendship between the navies of both countries,\" the port's management said.\nFor its part, the HMCS Ottawa hailed its visit as a show of Canada's growing engagement with the region.\n\"This visit allows us to clearly demonstrate an enduring defense commitment to the Indo-Pacific region and enhance Canada's role as a trusted international partner,\" it said on its Facebook page.\nHMCS Ottawa leaving Sihanoukville, Feb. 4, 2025.(Facebook: Ream naval base)\nCanada has been paying closer attention to maintaining strong relations with Cambodia, amid concerns over China's growing influence there and its claims on the strategically important South China Sea.\nCanada is upgrading its office in Phnom Penh to a full embassy with a resident ambassador this year. Until now, bilateral relations have been managed by its embassy in neighboring Thailand, with an office in Phnom Penh.\nSouth China Sea disputes\nImmediately before the visit to Cambodia, the HMCS Ottawa's crew spent a couple of rest days in Surabaya, Indonesia, after the successful completion of La Perouse 25, a nine-nation maricreated_at exercise led by the French navy, on Jan. 24, 2025.\nThe exercise took place in the straits of Malacca, Sunda and Lombok, which link the Indian and Pacific Oceans.\nThirteen vessels from Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the United States and France's Charles De Gaulle carrier strike group joined the drills, focused on maricreated_at safety training.\nThe HMCS Ottawa, however, attracted most attention last month when it conducted a joint exercise codenamed Noble Wolverine with U.S. Navy destroyer USS Higgins in the disputed South China Sea.\nThe ships navigated through the South China Sea's international waters while conducting communications exercises, flight operations and anti-submarine warfare training under the Chinese navy's close watch.\nChina has regularly condemned what it sees as outsiders' interference in the region over where it claims \"historic rights\" to almost 90% of the waterway despite protest from other littoral states.\nCambodia is part of the South China Sea dispute but it has in recent years moved closer to China which is Cambodia's biggest investor and provider of financial assistance.\nEdited by Mike Firn.\n"

Beijing said it threatened regional peace and stability.\nIt was the first created_at B-1 bombers were used for joint maneuvers in the South China Sea, the Philippine military said. The one-day exercise, staged on Tuesday, reflected the strong relations between the two longcreated_at treaty allies, officials said.\nSome security experts had said earlier that President Trump might pay less attention to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, which has been working to shore up international support against China in the South China Sea.\n\"It's the first exercise under the current administration of the U.S. government,\" Rear Adm. Roy Vincent Trinidad, the Philippine Navy spokesman for the West Philippine Sea, told a press briefing Tuesday.\nThe exercise involved two B-1 bombers attached to the U.S. Pacific Air Forces and three FA-50s from the Philippine Air Force, Col. Maria Consuelo Castillo, the PAF spokeswoman, told the same press briefing.\nThe B-1 is a more advanced version of the B-52 bomber, which the U.S. Air Force had deployed in previous training missions over the South China Sea, military officials said.\n\"This exercise is a crucial step in enhancing our interoperability, improving air domain awareness and agile combat employment and supporting our shared bilateral air objectives,\" Castillo said.\nFilipino officials said the exercise was not a direct response to recent Chinese military and coast guard activities in the South China Sea, where tensions have been high lately between Manila and Beijing.\nScarborough Shoal, which is claimed by both countries, lies within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone but has been under de facto Chinese control since 2012.\nChina: 'On high alert'\nIn response, Beijing said the joint exercise was a threat to peace and stability in the waterway.\n\"[T]he Philippines has been colluding with countries outside the region to organize the so-called 'joint patrols' to deliberately undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea,\" a spokesperson for China's military said on Tuesday.\nBeijing said it had also conducted a routine patrol in the airspace above Scarborough Shoal on Tuesday.\nChina's air force units would remain \"on high alert to resolutely defend China's territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests,\" the spokesperson said.\nCastillo said the PAF were prepared for radio challenges from China during the staging of the joint exercise, even though it proceeded \"regardless of the action of other foreign actors.\" As of press created_at, there were no reports of any such challenges.\nHowever, there were no scenarios where the airplanes simulated dogfights, Castillo said.\n\"[There's] no bombing exercise,\" she said.\nUnder the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, the Philippines and the United States are compelled to come to each other's aid in created_ats of external attacks. Under Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, Washington said that the scenario included armed attacks in the South China Sea.\nChina lays claim to almost the entire South China Sea, but its claims overlap with those of the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan. Over the past few months, Manila and Beijing have faced off in a series of confrontations at sea.\nIn related news, the Philippine military accused three Chinese Navy vessels of violating rules on innocent passage during their transit in Philippine waters.\nThe Chinese ships a frigate, cruiser and replenishment oiler were first monitored in the West Philippine Sea on Monday. The West Philippine Sea is Manila's name for South China Sea waters that lie within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\nThe ships traveled southward and moved at a speed of six knots (11.1 kph), passing through Basilan Channel, towards Indonesia.\nThey were tracked by the Philippine Navy and Air Force aircraft, the military said, adding that radio challenges were also issued against the Chinese ships.\nAs of Tuesday morning, Trinidad said the Chinese vessels were about 120 nautical miles south of Basilan. \"They are moving out of our exclusive economic zone,\" he said.\nDuring the radio challenges, the Chinese vessels said they were exercising freedom of navigation and innocent passage, according to Trinidad.\nA spokesperson for China's military also said on Monday that the passage complied with \"international law and practice.\"\n\"The violation was that the travel through our archipelagic waters was not expeditious,\" Trinidad said. \"They could have traveled at a faster speed. There were instances in the central part of Sulu Sea that they slowed down to five to six knots.\"\nTrinidad said the Chinese vessels were likely on the way to Indonesia to take part in an upcoming military exercise, dubbed Komodo, which would involve at least 37 countries.\nApart from Indonesia and China, some of the countries involved in the Komodo exercise this month are the Philippines, the United States, Japan, Australia, France, India, the United Kingdom, and South Korea.\n"

    "text": "\nIn a show of force and military cooperation, the Philippine and U.S. air forces have conducted joint exercises over the West Philippine Sea, also known as the South China Sea. These exercises, which include air patrols and interdiction training, are aimed at improving operational coordination and air domain awareness between the two nations.\nAccording to the Philippine Air Force (PAF), these exercises are crucial to improve interoperability and meet bilateral air defense objectives. Three PAF FA-50 aircraft participated in these exercises along with two. Notably, this is the first created_at B-1 bombers have been used in joint maneuvers in this area, indicating an intensification of military collaboration.\nThese exercises are taking place at a created_at of rising tensions between China and the Philippines due to maricreated_at and territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Beijing claims most of this sea, which overlaps with claims by the Philippines and other countries. The dispute over the Masinloc Bass (also known as the ), which is within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone but under Chinese control since 2012, is a key point of contention.\nThe Chinese government has expressed its displeasure with these exercises, calling them a threat to regional peace and stability. A Chinese military spokesman stated that the Philippines is \"colluding with countries outside the region\" to undermine stability in the South China Sea. China also reported that it conducted routine air patrols over Lower Masinloc on the same day as the joint exercises.\nDespite the tensions, Philippine officials insist that the exercises are not a direct response to recent Chinese military and coast guard activities in the area. However, collaboration between the Philippines and the United States has strengthened, especially under the current U.S. administration, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirming U.S. commitment to the Philippines in the face of China's actions. The two countries have been bound by a mutual defense treaty since 1951.\nUnder the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, the Philippines and the United States are obligated to assist each other in the event of external attacks. Under Trump's predecessor Joe Biden, Washington said the scenario included armed attacks in the South China Sea. China claims almost all of the South China Sea, but its claims overlap with those of the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan.\nAlthough the exercises do not include air combat simulations or bombing, the participation of B-1 bombers and the focus on interoperability suggest a clear signal of US support for its Philippine ally. This indicates a renewed US commitment to the Southeast Asian region and the importance of the alliance with the Philippines in the context of regional tensions with China.\n"

    "text": "\nU.S. Air Force bombers joined Philippine fighter jets for joint training over the South China Sea amid a simmering territorial dispute with China.\nNewsweek has contacted the Chinese Foreign Ministry with a written request for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nThe exercises took place less than a month after the U.S. sent supersonic B-1 bombers to Guam's Andersen Air Force Base during heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula and ongoing disputes involving China and two U.S. security treaty allies, Japan and the Philippines.\nThe past two years have seen Chinese maricreated_at forces steadily expanding their presence within the Philippines' internationally recognized exclusive economic zone. China has responded forcefully to the Philippines' resistance in contested waters, with tactics that include ramming, water cannons and blockades.\nWhat To Know\nTuesday's joint drills involved two B-1B bombers and three of the Philippines' dozen FA-50s, the country's main fighter jet and a combat-enhanced variant of the South Korean-made T-50.\nThe exercises, which took place over the Southeast Asian nation's maricreated_at zone, were focused on bolstering air domain awareness and coordination between the two air forces, including in combat capabilities, the Philippine Air Force said in a news release.\nThe U.S. and the Philippines, the oldest American ally in Asia, share a seven-decades-old Mutual Defense Treaty that both the Biden and Trump administrations have called ironclad.\nThe two countries jointly operate several military bases across the Philippines and regularly conduct naval and air exercises to improve interoperability.\nHowever, the somecreated_ats violent clashes with China, which on several occasions left Philippine service members injured, have raised questions over the prospect of drawing U.S. forces into a conflict with China. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has stressed that he does not seek escalation, but he has said the \"willful\" killing of a Philippine national would be a red line.\nWhat People Are Saying\nThe U.S. Pacific Air Force wrote on social media on Tuesday: \"U.S. Air Force B-1Bs and Philippine Air Force FA-50s flew in a joint air patrol and intercept exercise aimed to enhance our operational coordination, refine our tactical and operational strategies together, and maintain our air dominance and regional security in a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"\nThe Philippine Air Force wrote: \"By conducting these exercises, both air forces refined their tactical and operational strategies while working to meet shared air defense objectives and operational goals.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nThe tensions with China are a major factor behind the $35 billion military modernization program the Philippines is planning to carry out over the next decade.\nOn January 22, in one of his first international conversations as U.S. secretary of state, Marco Rubio spoke with Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo. According to a news release from the State Department, how to increase defense cooperation was one of the topics they discussed.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nPhilippine Fighter Jets Train With B-1 Bombers\nPhilippine Air Force\nTwo Philippine Air Force FA-50 fighter jets fly in formation with two B-1 bombers of the U.S. Pacific Air Forces during a joint air patrol and intercept exercise over the South China Sea on February 4.\n"

    "text": "\n As a non-claimant state in the South China Sea dispute, Cambodia is urged to uphold its neutrality, avoiding alignment in the territorial conflicts between ASEAN member states and China. At the same created_at, Cambodia supports ASEAN's collective decisions regarding one of the world's most strategically important maricreated_at corridors.\nExperts warn that the involvement of major powers could impede progress in establishing a Code of Conduct (COC) and complicate efforts to reach peaceful resolutions.\nThe ongoing negotiations for the COC, initiated in March 2018, follow the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), which was issued by ASEAN member states and China to promote peace and stability in the region.\nThe South China Sea dispute involves multiple overlapping territorial claims, primarily among China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei. This strategic waterway is crucial for global trade, with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development estimating that over 21% of global commerce, valued at $3.37 trillion, passed through its waters in 2016.\nIn an interview with Khmer created_ats, Pou Sothirak, a retired academic and Senior Advisor to the Cambodian Centre for Regional Studies (CCRS) and a retired diplomat, underscored the necessity for ASEAN to uphold its centrality in managing disputes involving regional and external powers.\n'ASEAN centrality is about leadership, it's about unity, it's about one voice behind very clear decisions on a rules-based order. You have to be very clear on the issues because otherwise ASEAN relevancy, ASEAN centrality is in doubt. And once it's in doubt, all ASEAN framework will also be weakened,' he said.\nHe emphasised the importance of strengthening ASEAN's strategic autonomy, stating, 'That means we make our own decision without any power telling us what to do.'\nSothirak outlined three layers of interaction within the dispute. The first involves the direct claimants-Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei-who have overlapping maricreated_at and territorial claims with China.\n'For ASEAN to strengthen its position, the claimant states needs to be united. They need to have one voice again... when they negotiate with China, they need to speak the same thing,' he noted, citing the Philippines' decision to take the case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA).\n'But Vietnam did not do the same. Malaysia did not do the same. Brunei didn't do anything,' Sothirak said. 'So China favours bilateral negotiation.'\nIn 2016, the PCA ruled in favour of the Philippines, declaring China's claims under the nine-dash line as having no legal basis. However, China dismissed the ruling, calling it 'null and void.'\nChina asserts historical rights over most of the South China Sea, marked by the 'nine-dash line,' which overlaps with the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of several ASEAN countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.\nRegarding Cambodia's neutrality in the South China Sea dispute, Professor Shotaro Hamamoto of Kyoto University was of the view that while the country has refrained from taking a position, such decisions have long-term implications.\n'Certainly, I don't think Cambodia has been actively supporting China for not implementing the South China Sea arbitration,' Prof Hamamoto said.\nRegarding Cambodia's position as a non-claimant state, Sothirak expressed support for the government's policy of neutrality.\n'Our principle is to be neutral. Our principle is that we support ASEAN collective decisions on the South China Sea, and we take no positions on the issues. And many created_ats, over, the government has already made this statement,' he said.\nAs ASEAN and China continue discussions, Cambodia remains steadfast in its commitment to neutrality, advocating for diplomatic engagement and regional stability in one of the world's most strategically significant maricreated_at corridors.\nSo Naro, Minister Delegate Attached to the Prime Minister in charge of ASEAN Affairs, reiterated Cambodia's neutral position. 'Cambodia urges all parties to exercise patience and resolve disputes peacefully through dialogue and negotiations while fully implementing the DOC to prevent escalation,' he told Khmer created_ats.\nThe second layer of complexity, according to Sothirak, involves the engagement of extra-regional powers, particularly the United States.\n'The Americans are not happy that China keeps saying that a third party should not get involved in the South China Sea issue. Because the Americans view the South China Sea as an international waterway where all countries can navigate or fly over it. They believe the international airspace and waters should be free and open, and this is a contentious issue,' he said.\nIn support of its contention, the US has sent naval vessels to sail in the area.\nChina has argued that while it supports freedom of navigation, it opposes what it perceives as 'military provocations' by external powers, particularly US naval patrols in contested areas.\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Prak Sokhonn has also previously expressed hopes for a resolution. 'Cambodia, as a non-claimant state, wishes to stay neutral with regard to territorial dispute, and we hope all parties concerned will continue to maintain conducive environment for safeguarding peace, security and stability in the region, thus contributing to the conclusion of the COC negotiation,' he said in a statement.\nThe COC for the South China Sea remains under negotiation between China and ASEAN.\nIn July 2023, both sides agreed on new guidelines to expedite the process, aiming to conclude negotiations by 2026.\n"

'It is part of our imagined community and experienced culture. The West Philippine Sea forms part of our national sovereignty in the exercise of our sovereign rights.'\nHistorian Xiao Chua said in a Facebook post Tuesday night: 'Granting for the sake of argument that the West Philippine Sea does not exist, then we can also say that the Philippines itself does not exist because 'the nation is just an imagined community' invented by the writings and ideas of our heroes.'\n'But we do exist! And so is our EEZ (exclusive economic zone),' Chua continued.\nIn 2012, President Benigno Aquino III signed an administrative order renaming South China Sea waters within the western section of the country's EEZ as West Philippine Sea.\nContrary to Marcoleta's remarks, Aquino had directed the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority to produce and publish charts and maps of the Philippines showing the West Philippine Sea.\n'It was legally constructed in 2012 to tell the world of the metes and bounds of our maricreated_at domains and territories and the world has warmly embraced it,' Cabalza said, noting that there is a 'humongous text of scholarly literature' about the West Philippine Sea which are now being taught and discussed in top universities worldwide.\nAquino made such a move in a bid to assert Manila's sovereign rights further.\nIt was during the late president's term when Manila brought Beijing before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, Netherlands to contest the latter's sweeping claims in the South China Sea.\nIn July 2016, an international tribunal ruled heavily in favor of Manila while effectively invalidating Beijing's then-nine-dash line-now 'ten-dash line'-claim.\n'West Philippine Sea is now part of our linguistic parlance and vocabulary,' Cabalza said.\n'Ordinary Filipinos somecreated_ats equate national security to the issues in the West Philippine Sea,' he added.\n"

Jay Tarriela, Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesperson for WPS, had this to say to SAGIP Party-list Rep. Rodante Marcoleta on Tuesday, Feb. 4, after the latter claimed that the water which forms part of the broader South China Sea (SCS) and is included in the Philippines' 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is not real.\n\"Hearing someone claim that the 'West Philippine Sea' is merely a fabrication of the Philippine government is a disservice and an embarrassment to their entire party, the organization they belong to, and even their own family,\" Tarriela said in response to Marcoleta's controversial statements.\nTarriela echoed President Marcos Jr.'s remarks during his third State of the Nation Address (SONA) in 2024 that the WPS \"is not merely a figment of our imagination.\"\n\"I stand by the statement of President [Marcos] when he said, 'Ang West Philippine Sea ay hindi kathang isip natin lamang. Ito ay atin. Ito ay mananatiling atin hangga't nag-aalab ang diwa ng ating minamahal na bansang Pilipinas (The West Philippine Sea is not merely a figment of our imagination. It is ours. It will remain ours, as long as the spirit of our beloved country, the Philippines, continues to burn.)\nThe outspoken Coast Guard official then asked how an individual like Marcoleta could face the younger generations today and tell them that the country's EEZ to the west of the Philippine archipelago \"is non-existent.\"\nHe said this is tantamount to \"effectively giving up the fight to assert their rights as Filipinos in the West Philippine Sea\".\nDuring a House tri-committee hearing which tackled the prevalence of fake news and deepfakes online, Marcoleta stated that there was a need to educate Filipinos on the complex issues surrounding the South China Sea (SCS).\n\"There is no such thing as [West Philippine Sea]. That's nothing, that is a creation by us,\" Marcoleta said. \"Just to be real, even if you read our map or what, there is no [West Philippine Sea].\"\nThe term \"West Philippine Sea\" was first used by the Philippine government in 2011 during the administration of the late President Benigno \"Noynoy\" Aquino III when referring to the maricreated_at areas on the western side of the Philippine archipelago that are within its EEZ.\nIn 2012, Aquino issued Administrative Order No. 29 where the government formally adopted the term West Philippine Sea. In the same year, the Aquino administration initiated an arbitration process to protest China's claims in the SCS, including parts of the WPS which, experts believe, are rich in maricreated_at resources and gas.\nFour years later, in 2016, the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) invalidated China's dash-line claims, but Beijing ignored the decision and continued to stake its claims in the SCS.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

    "text": "\nFebruary 5th, 2025 ( Al Jazeera English  - Delivered by  Newstex )\nPhilippine Vice President Sara Duterte has been impeached by the lower house of Congress after lawmakers, many of whom are allies of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, signed a petition to remove her from office.While specifics have not been divulged, the impeachment vote on Wednesday follows a  string of complaints accusing Duterte of crimes ranging from the misuse of public funds to plotting Marcos's assassination.Dutertehas consistently denied wrongdoing and has described moves against her as a political vendetta.'Having been filed by more than one-third of the membership of the House of Representatives, or a total of 215 [out of 306] members, the motion is approved,' House Speaker Martin Romualdez told lawmakers.Her fate is now in the hands of 24 senators, two-thirds of whom must vote for her impeachment for her to be removed from office.Although a trial date has not been set, she will remain vice president during the impeachment proceedings.Duterte is the fourth official in the Philippines to be impeached after former President Joseph Estrada, an ombudsman and a former Supreme Court chief justice.In the Philippines, top officials may be impeached for culpable violation of the constitution, treason, bribery, corruption, other high crimes or betrayal of public trust.The House vote comes days before campaigning begins for the midterm elections, widely expected to set the table for the 2028 presidential race.Marcos had previously urged Congress not to pursue Duterte's impeachment, calling it a 'storm in a teacup' that would distract the legislature from its primary responsibilities.On Monday, however, Marcos's executive secretary, Lucas Bersamin, said the Office of the President would 'not interfere' with the impeachment complaints.Former allies turned foes\nFor years, Duterte was primed to succeed her controversial father, Rodrigo, as president, but she eventually stepped aside to back Marcos, running as vice president on his ticket.Together, they won a  landslide victory in 2022.But the alliance has since imploded, giving way to a months-long public spat that has seen the trading of wild accusations.In November, Duterte delivered an expletive-laden speech saying she had  ordered someone to kill Marcos if she herself was assassinated.She has accused Marcos and his wife of corruption, weak leadership and trying to muzzle her because of speculation she may seek the presidency in 2028.Meanwhile, Duterte has been accused of misusing 612.5 million pesos ($10.3m) of public funds, which led to her resignation in June from Marcos's cabinet, in which she oversaw the Department of Education.She has also been criticised for her failure to stand up to China in the disputed  South China Sea.Link to the original story.N"

    "text": "\n Footage of warships conducting drill in the Pacific follows exchange between Beijing and Manila over navy transit   \nChinese state television has aired footage of a destroyer fleet conducting an exercise in the Pacific Ocean, after Beijing and Manila traded barbs over a PLA Navy transit through the Basilan Strait earlier this week. \nThe CCTV report on Tuesday showed the Zunyi Type 055 destroyer, Hengyang Type 054A frigate and Weishanhu Type 903 replenishment vessel carrying out far-sea combat training at an undisclosed Pacific location over the Lunar New Year. \nThey were the same three warships seen sailing through the 18km (11-mile) Basilan Strait - which separates the Philippine islands of Mindanao and Basilan - towards the Sulu Sea on Sunday. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nThe People's Liberation Army warships, led by the stealth guided-missile destroyer, play an important role in China's blue-water naval ambitions. \nTuesday's report highlighted young sailors taking part in the drill who were on their first deployment. \nAccording to former PLA instructor Song Zhongping, the message of the state television report was that the Basilan Strait transit \"was just a routine naval exercise and should not be misinterpreted as a deterrence manoeuvre, or a show of force\". \nOn Monday, the Philippines condemned the transit as \"not consistent with the principles of innocent passage\", while China claimed it fully complied with international law and norms and accused Manila of politicising routine naval movements. \nSome observers said the timing of the CCTV report - soon after Manila objected to the warships sailing through the strait - suggested Beijing wanted to downplay the transit. Others saw it as a calculated response to growing scrutiny of Chinese military activities in the region. \nThe fleet's passage came amid heightened tensions following a run-in between Chinese and Philippine vessels near the disputed Iroquois Reef - known as Houteng in China and Rozul in the Philippines - as well as joint US-Philippine drills in the South China Sea, and a call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Philippine counterpart Enrique Manalo. \nIt also coincided with the departure of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier from waters near the disputed Spratly Islands, known as Nansha in Chinese. Some analysts suggest these factors made the Basilan Strait an ideal choice for Beijing to assert its naval presence while staying within legal bounds. \nThe CCTV report said that as part of the ongoing exercise the fleet would conduct live-fire weapon tests and multi-domain combat drills to improve coordinated operations on the high seas. \nIt said the training - which began over the Lunar New Year holiday period that ended on Tuesday - showed the commitment of personnel to maintaining combat readiness. \n\"The fleet is conducting real-combat drills across multiple disciplines, ensuring that under any circumstances, we can deploy, engage and prevail,\" said the report, which also described the drill as routine training. \nSenior Sergeant Wu Pengfei, who appeared in the report, emphasised the importance of safeguarding China's maricreated_at interests. \n\"Even during the New Year, combat training cannot be relaxed,\" Wu said. \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "text": "\nManila, Feb. 5 -- Amid already tensed relations with China, Department of National Defense (DND) Secretary Gilbert Teodoro Jr. asked Beijing to stop its spying activities that target Philippine officials and infrastructure.\nDefense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro Jr. (left) delivers his speech at the Waitangi Day Reception in Makati City. Also in the photo is New Zealand Ambassador to the Philippines Catherine McIntosh (Raymund Antonio/MANILA BULLETIN)\nThe defense chief was a guest during the Waitangi Day Reception held by the New Zealand Embassy in Makati City on Tuesday night, Feb. 4.\n\"We are very aware of these attempts. And as a responsible country, China should put a stop with these illicit activities,\" he said.\nHe insisted that the activities could very well be state-sponsored because of \"an agent of their security service.\"\n\"So, by their own legal internal act, they criminalize themselves,\" Teodoro pointed out.\nHis remarks came after a series of arrests of alleged Chinese spy, including a Rappler report on Steve Zhang, verified as an agent of China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) who purportedly conducted intelligence gathering and set up an espionage and influence network under his cover as a reporter for a Shanghai-based publication.\nSince the report came out in August 2024, Zhang has not returned to the Philippines.\nThe National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) also confirmed a GMA News report that two Chinese were caught taking videos of a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessel in Palawan.\nThe two were nabbed at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) upon their arrival from the province, while four of their cohorts, also Chinese nationals, were arrested in different locations.\nThese arrests were made just over a week after Deng Yuanqing, along with his two Filipino drivers, were arrested for suspected espionage after they gathered information from and about military facilities and critical Philippine infrastructure.\nTeodoro refused to say whether he had fallen victim to spying, but said he is aware of such activities.\n\"And troll farms are active and that is why we are also working closely with the legislature to amend the espionage law and foreign corrupt practices,\" he added.\nBut amid the backdrop of Beijing's aggressive actions in the South China Sea, including in the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and territorial waters in the West Philippine Sea, the DND secretary stressed the need to strengthen the military's defense capabilities.\n\"This is a struggle. What's next is, you know on my end, is to fortify and strengthen the defense establishments and to build up a deterrent capability which is extremely important,\" he said.\nChina has ramped up its aggressive activities in the resource-rich region, which it claims almost in its entirety, including the EEZs of its neighbors-the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Brunei.\nWhile the Philippines has pushed back against these actions, including a 2016 arbitral tribunal victory that invalidated the basis of Beijing's claim, China refused to heed the international community's call to heed international maricreated_at laws.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

    "created_at": "2025-02-05",
    "text": "\nAccording to Eyorio on February 3, 2025, the Armed Forces of the Philippines intends to acquire additional 155mm self-propelled howitzers in 2025, though no official confirmation has been made. The Philippine Army operates 12 ATMOS 2000 155mm self-propelled howitzers acquired from Israels Elbit Systems. If confirmed, this potential acquisition is part of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) modernization program, which has faced funding adjustments, with only $595 million of its $1.275 billion 2025 budget guaranteed.\nThe Philippine Armys ATMOS 2000 units were procured through a government-to-government agreement with Israel for $40.8 million. The contract was finalized in early 2020, with deliveries completed in December 2021. The Army formed two batteries, each containing six howitzers, and assigned them to the 10th Field Artillery Battalion, activated in June 2022. The first operational deployment of the system occurred in 2024 during the \"Katihan\" Combined Arms Training Exercise (CATEX) at Camp O'Donnell. The howitzers were later integrated into Balikatan 24, a joint military exercise with U.S. forces at the La Paz Sand Dunes.\nThe ATMOS 2000 is an Israeli 155mm/52 caliber self-propelled howitzer mounted on a 6x6 truck chassis. It has a maximum firing range exceeding 40 km with Extended Range Full-Bore - Base Bleed (ERFB-BB) projectiles, 30 km with NATO L15 high-explosive projectiles, and 24.5 km with M107 high-explosive projectiles. The system can fire between 4 and 9 rounds per minute and is equipped with a computerized fire control system for target acquisition and aiming. It operates with a crew of 2 to 6 personnel. The Philippine Armys units use German MAN truck platforms, selected for their established maintenance and logistics support in the country.\nThe Philippine Army operates multiple artillery systems in addition to the ATMOS 2000, including the Soltam M-71 155mm towed howitzer, M114A1 155mm towed howitzer, M101 and M102 105mm howitzers, and OTO Melara Model 56 pack howitzer. The Army also employs the Cardom 120mm self-propelled mortar system and various mortar models, including the M224 60mm and M69 81mm systems. Multiple-launch rocket systems from South Korea were previously acquired, and the Army is evaluating additional long-range artillery options such as the K239 Chunmoo or PULS systems.\nThe Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) modernization program is in its final phase, Re-Horizon 3, approved in January 2024 with an estimated cost of $34 billion over ten years. The 2025 budget allocates $4.353 billion to defense, a 6.4% increase from 2024. Of this amount, $850 million is designated for military modernization. However, only $595 million is guaranteed, while $680 million remains under unprogrammed appropriations, requiring excess revenue before release. This reliance on standby funds marks a shift from previous years when guaranteed funding exceeded unprogrammed allocations.\nThe executive branch initially proposed $850 million for the AFP modernization program in 2025, but Congress realigned $255 million to unprogrammed appropriations. This contrasts with past budgets under the Duterte administration, where guaranteed funds ranged from $425 million to $493 million, and unprogrammed portions did not exceed $187 million. In 2024, none of the $170 million in unprogrammed funds for military modernization had been released as of September. Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro raised concerns in legislative hearings, while senators highlighted risks of delays in priority acquisitions.\nThe AFP modernization program initially focused on internal security but has shifted toward external defense, particularly in response to maricreated_at territorial disputes. The Philippine Armys procurement plans prioritize land-based missile systems, anti-aircraft weapons, and additional armored vehicles. The 2025 budget includes $3.475 billion for land, air, and naval forces, with $850 million allocated for modernization programs. The Philippine Coast Guard, involved in patrols and resupply missions in the South China Sea, will see a 6% budget increase to $534 million.\nDespite budget increases, reliance on unprogrammed appropriations affects acquisition created_atlines. Budget adjustments have already impacted several projects, including cyber systems, forward support equipment, and tactical combat vehicles. The AFP modernization program has expanded since 2018, with total funding increasing from $510 million to $1.275 billion by 2025. However, the share of unprogrammed funds has also risen from $85 million in 2018 to $680 million in 2025. The Philippine Army continues to evaluate procurement options for additional self-propelled howitzers, multiple-launch rocket systems, and advanced air defense systems, with future acquisitions dependent on budget availability and revenue conditions.\n"

    "title": "'The Unlikely War Hero' shines a light on smart survivor of notorious Vietnam POW camp",
    "created_at": "2025-02-05",
    "text": "\nFeb. 5—History and pop culture have trained us to celebrate battlefield heroics and other forms of physical courage. Those actions are undeniably admirable, and in the past decade many Vietnam veterans have received overdue valor medals or had existing awards upgraded.\nHeroism also comes in other forms.\nDoug Hegdahl, the subject of Marc Leepson's \"The Unlikely War Hero: A Vietnam War POW's Story of Courage and Resilience in the Hanoi Hilton,\" engaged in quieter, more cerebral acts, but he was a hero of the Vietnam War just the same.\nThe average reader probably hasn't heard of Hegdahl. It's not because his story isn't fascinating. In short, a young man from tiny Clark, S.D., committed some of the most courageous noncombat actions of the war.\nIn the early hours of April 6, 1967, Hegdahl fell off the guided missile cruiser USS Canberra as it fired its 5- and 8-inch guns from the Gulf of Tonkin on North Vietnamese positions inland. The member of the deck crew went up to watch the guns fire, but he couldn't remember how he ended up in the water. Notext saw the 20-year-old seaman apprentice go overboard. His shipmates did not know for hours that he was missing. His captain did not turn the warship around to look for him.\nAfter treading water for hours, the exhausted Hegdahl was pulled from the South China Sea by fishermen. His rescue took a quick turn, however, when the fishermen turned the young sailor over to the North Vietnamese.\nHe ultimately ended up in the Hoa Lo prison camp. That name also might be unfamiliar, but most probably know the name mockingly given to it by American prisoners of war: the Hanoi Hilton.\nHegdahl was subjected to intense interrogation, and to torture when his answers failed to satisfy his captors. He quickly devised a strategy to confuse his interrogators and, hopefully, escape severe punishment.\n\"I had probably the most embarrassing capture in the entire Vietnam War,\" Hegdahl said during a 1997 interview cited in the book. \"I found that my defense posture was just to play dumb. Let's face it, when you fall off your boat, you have a lot to work with.\"\nIt worked. Although prison officials initially thought that Hegdahl was a spy (a suspicion shared by even some of his compatriots, among other theories), he quickly dissuaded them of the notion. He convinced them that he knew little valuable information, or little at all. It worked so well that he came to be known as \"The Incredibly Stupid One\" by his captors.\nHegdahl was anything but stupid.\nThe bumpkin act caused the North Vietnamese to pay Hegdahl little mind. He was the youngest and lowest-ranking man in the camp, which was full of experienced pilots and navigators. Since prison officials thought he was a simpleton, Hegdahl often was allowed unsupervised created_at to sweep the yard. He spent some of that created_at sabotaging camp vehicles. Once he even wandered out into the street, helping him to pinpoint the camp's location.\nA few months into his captivity, Hegdahl was placed in a cell with a senior Naval officer, Lt. Cmdr. Richard Stratton, who became Hegdahl's closest friend during his captivity and for decades after the war. Stratton recognized Hegdahl's smarts, and the need to use them.\nHegdahl's knack for memorization was a tremendous asset, and one that dovetailed with POW efforts underway at the Hanoi Hilton. Picking up on a practice already in place, he memorized the names of 254 prisoners. All the while, he played his subterfuge to the hilt. His captors treated him like the village idiot, while Hegdahl foiled their attempts to use him for propaganda purposes and banked vital information.\nThe North Vietnamese released Hegdahl in August 1969, without a clue as to the storehouse of valuable intel locked in his mind. Information that gave hope to families of missing and imprisoned servicemen. Information that helped to change the conditions in the Hanoi Hilton.\nSaid Roger Shields, who served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for POW/MIA Affairs from 1971 to 1977: Hegdahl \"saved many, many lives.  I don't think there's any doubt about it.\"\n\"The North Vietnamese released Hegdahl in August 1969, without a clue as to the storehouse of valuable intel locked in his mind. Information that gave hope to families of missing and imprisoned servicemen. Information that helped to change the conditions in the Hanoi Hilton.\"\nLeepson, a Vietnam veteran, historian and the longcreated_at senior writer, arts editor and columnist for The VVA Veteran (the magazine of Vietnam Veterans of America), has a firm handle on the subject. Utilizing archival research, personal interviews and his own experiences in the war, Leepson has written a thoroughly engaging biography — the first of its kind — about one of the unsung heroes of Vietnam.\n\"The Unlikely War Hero\" was the No. 1 bestselling Vietnam history book on Amazon just prior to its mid-December release, and it is already into its third printing. It's little wonder; Hegdahl's incredible story adds a compelling facet to the canon of Vietnam literature.\nLeepson provides valuable context regarding life in the camp, such as how prisoners forbidden to communicate with one another did just that. He sketches the politics of the era — without bogging down the story — and the external forces, within the U.S. government and the anti-war movement, which affected life on the inside for the POWs.\nHegdahl, who has not spoken publicly about his captivity since around 2000, chose not to participate in the book, citing a desire to remain a private person. That's a shame, if only because Leepson likely could have drawn more insight or a new perspective out of him. But the book does not suffer for his absence. It is meticulously researched, and it makes expert use of interviews Hegdahl did in his first several years after returning to the U.S.\nLeepson, who has written about a wide range of historical topics, uses varied sources to buttress the narrative but never weighs it down with footnotes or tangents. The writing is clean, generally conversational, and absent of excessive acronyms or jargon that might turn off many readers.\nHegdahl didn't face overwhelming odds on the battlefield. He didn't jump on a grenade to save his fellow servicemen. But what he did as a POW and as an advocate for fellow prisoners was no less heroic. It is a compelling story, told by a skilled storyteller. At the end of the book, Leepson makes a case for Hegdahl to receive the Navy and Marine Corps Medal (although Hegdahl has resisted such efforts). By the end of \"The Unlikely War Hero,\" you'll wonder why it didn't happen decades ago.\nSean Moores\nSean Moores\n© 2025 the Stars and Stripes. Visit www.stripes.com.

    "title": "Trump Is Behaving a Lot Like Beijing",
    "created_at": "2025-02-05",
    "text": "\nFebruary 5th, 2025 ( Foreign Policy  - Delivered by  Newstex )\nNearly 15 years ago, China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, served notice to his country's neighbors that a new era was commencing, one of unbridled assertiveness from Beijing.After regional diplomats complained about China's territorial claims in the South China Sea during an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting in July 2010, Yang sent a chill through the audience.'China is a big country.And you are small countries.And that is a fact,' he  said, in a bald variation on the old maxim that might makes right.Yang's comments quickly came to be seen as part of the launch of a new style of Chinese diplomacy: the so-called  wolf warrior era, when China would make no apologies for its actions while demanding that other nations yield to its desires.He demonstrated that his country was a revisionist power-one willing to lay waste to the existing world order and the rules that underpin it in the narrow pursuit of its national interests.Since then, the toll of China's aggressive approach has become clear.Fear and distrust of Beijing have helped Washington shore up its alliances in Asia, even fueling a rapprochement between countries with long-standing mutual distrust, such as Japan and South Korea.China's actions have also induced India to deepen its security cooperation, if not outright alliance, with the United States and its allies Japan and Australia.Perhaps the best evidence of the failure of China's sharp turn, though, lies in its own course correction.It is safe to assume that Beijing's national interests haven't changed much, but its diplomatic strategy certainly has.In recent years, China's most vociferous diplomats have become much more likely to voice  support for the international system, free trade and open markets, and cooperation with other states.There has never been a better created_at to think back to the 2010 ASEAN summit and its dismal aftermath for China.A little more than two weeks since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, the United States-a country that usually emphasizes its support for the long-standing conventions of an orderly international system, whatever the contradictions-has become the most revisionist state the globe has seen since World War II.New evidence of this comes on a near-daily basis, but the most disturbing example occurred on Tuesday, when Trump  announced during a press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the United States may seek to take over Gaza and evict its 2 million Palestinian residents to turn it into the 'Riviera of the Middle East.'Both the language and symbolism were grotesquely revolting-far worse, in fact, than Yang's crude expression of power.Here was a convicted felon, Trump, standing with an indicted war criminal who has personally overseen the utter devastation of Gaza,  speaking of the land of a besieged people as if it were little more than a real estate opportunity-a 'demolition site' ripe for development that Palestinians 'have no alternative' but to abandon.Trump said he didn't want to sound like a 'wise guy,' but by then it was too late to avoid that impression.Like Yang, Trump has sounded a shrill alarm, but this created_at it is not limited to a single region.A few days earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio  issued a crude ultimatum to Panama's leader, threatening action against the country if it did not bow to U.S. demands to reduce China's influence over the Panama Canal.In recent days, Trump has also announced-and then temporarily paused-stiff tariffs on the United States' two biggest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, despite long-standing close ties, including a trade agreement that Trump himself endorsed during his previous term.These threats, too, came with a 'wise guy' ring to them: Make public concessions to me, Trump seemed to say, or I will wreak utter havoc on your economies with an immediate 25 percent increase in tariffs.The week before, it was Greenland, with Trump's repeated demands that Denmark-which enjoys a quasi-colonial custodianship of the territory-cede it outright to the United States.Those demands came with threats that if Denmark didn't get the message, it, too, would face economic pain or perhaps even U.S. intervention in Greenland.The signs of backlash to Trump's designs are beginning to gather like storm clouds on the horizon.Not only did Middle East states denounce the idea of a U.S. takeover of Gaza and the expulsion of Palestinians, but so too have leading  U.S. allies, such as Germany and France.If Trump persists with this unilateralist folly, stronger opposition is certain.Fortified by delusions about a commanding mandate, when in fact he won a small election victory and enjoys tiny margins in Congress, Trump seems to think that the United States is in an equally commanding position internationally-that it has the might to simply demand that friend and foe alike yield to its wishes.The fact is, though, that the world is more multipolar than it has been since the early 20th century, before Washington's sharp postwar rise.Global wealth and power are much more diffuse today than they were during the decades of U.S. preeminence.And just as Asian countries reconfigured their diplomacy in response to an imposing China, states will figure out a way to do so in relation to a United States under Trump.What will be left of the country's international standing by the created_at this lesson is absorbed?Washington's conservative hawks somecreated_ats speak of competition with China in strikingly narrow terms.The United States can prevail, they seem to think, by  acquiring more advanced weapons and ensuring technological leadership in other areas, such as artificial intelligence.What they forget is that modern U.S. power is based on Washington's partnerships and the power of its example.However flawed the latter can be, the country has never jettisoned claims to idealism behind its leadership, until now.Notext has ever loved the United States all the created_at, but admiration for-and emulation of-Washington has long been widespread, and this has been a secret sauce more powerful than any submarine fleet or space force.But what happens when the United States throws strengths like these, along with a respect for rule of law and democracy, out the window?What happens when a U.S. president says in effect that small countries must roll over and obey?What happens when a would-be strongman decides that he can pursue his own interests and whims?What happens when traditional checks and balances built into the U.S. system-not just Congress and the courts but a strong, independent, and fearless press-are being dismantled?What happens when U.S. politics becomes increasingly  overtaken by white nationalism?What happens when Washington turns more vicious toward immigrants, one of the vital forces that built the country, rounding them up aboard military aircraft for publicized deportation to Guantnamo Bay?In a world where China may already be wealthier than the United States by some measures, what will happen if the United States jettisons its values, trashes its institutions, and continues to throw its weight around?What would the argument be for siding with Washington versus Beijing anymore or forging other alliances and arrangements?If the United States continues down its present path, we may soon find out.Link to the original story.N"

    "text": "\nKey View\nThe upstream oil and gas sector in Southeast Asia is poised for significant activity in 2025, driven by both local and international investments, particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia.\nMalaysia's offshore exploration activities are also expected to accelerate in 2025 and 2026 following the 2024 awards of exploration blocks.\nVietnam is intensifying its exploration efforts, especially in deep-water areas, to counter declining production from mature fields.\nThe upstream oil and gas sector in Southeast Asia is poised for significant activity in 2025, driven by both local and international investments, particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia. The region concluded 2024 with numerous discoveries, production sharing contract awards, and project commissions, setting a positive tone for the coming year. Indonesia's upstream exploration has made remarkable strides with major discoveries reported between 2023 and 2024. SKK Migas noted a substantial investment of USD11.2 billion in upstream oil and gas projects by October 2023, with expectations for continued growth in 2025. In December 2024, the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources revealed the discovery of 4.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BBOE) across various basins, including the East Natuna and Makassar Strait Basins. Additional reserves in the Makassar and Barito Straits are anticipated to be confirmed soon.September 2024 marked the awarding of three blocks in the Indonesian Petroleum Bidding Round (IPBR) 1 2024 to different consortiums, with the Melati block in Sulawesi emerging as a key area of interest. Mubadala Energy's May 2024 discovery of 2 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas at the Tangkulo-1 Exploration well in South Andaman further invigorates the sector, with exploration set to continue through 2030. SKK Migas awarded Central Andaman Oil and Gas Working Area (Migas WK) Contract, the first Oil and Gas Working Area with the New Gross Split scheme to Harbour Energy (60%) and Mubadala Energy (40%) in September 2024.A Investments in Indonesia's upstream gas projects are expected to rise significantly between 2025 and 2026, driven by major projects like the Geng North and Layaran gas fields. \nThese fields are pivotal in meeting the government's target of producing 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day by 2030, thereby enhancing domestic energy security.\n\nIndonesia Ramping Up Exploration Efforts To Meet Production Targets\n  Source: Petronas, company press releases, BMI   Malaysia's offshore exploration activities are also expected to accelerate in 2025 and 2026 following the 2024 awards of exploration blocks.A In December 2024, Petronas awarded four Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) for several clusters and exploration blocks under the Malaysia Bid Round 2024. Notable awards include the Raja cluster in Peninsular Malaysia and the Ubah Cluster offshore Sabah. A A consortium of ConocoPhillips Malaysia New Ventures Limited, Sabah Shell Petroleum Company Limited, and Petronas won the exploration rights in the Ubah Cluster, located offshore Sabah.A Exploration block PM515 was awarded under the Enhanced Profitability Terms PSC to Petronas and E&P Malaysia Venture Sdn. Bhd.A The Bekok Deep-1 discovery that Petronas announced in May 2024 promises further exploration successes in Malaysia.AUpstream investment projects are in the pipeline although the final investment decision for the Lang Lebah field has been deferred to 2025 due to cost and jurisdictional disputes. Despite these challenges, the Lang Lebah field is expected to produce 600-800mmscfd, or about 7bcm at peak. Future exploration activities in Sarawak state could be constrained by ongoing disputes between Petronas and the Sarawak government over control and ownership of oil and gas assets in Sarawak state. Vietnam is intensifying its exploration efforts, especially in deep-water areas, to counter declining production from mature fields. The country achieved two significant discoveries in 2024, namely the Ra>>&quot;ng and Bunga Aster fields, showing promising potential. Long-term commitments, such as IndiaaEURtms ONGC Videsh's 16-year contract extension for Block 06.1 in the Nam Con Son basin until 2039 and a three-year extension for exploring Block 128 in the South China SeaA underpins Vietnam's relative attractiveness toA A to sustaining its upstream sector. A key development is Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. (MOECO) and its partners have reached a final investment decision on the development of offshore Block B natural gas field which will be linked via a pipeline to gas-fired power plant. Block B project which is scheduled to complete by the end of 2026 is estimated to produce 490 million cubic feet per day.A Such development underscore foreign investorsaEURtm commitment to sustaining VietnamaEURtms upstream sector.In contrast, Myanmar's upstream sector faces substantial challenges, including political instability and international sanctions. The withdrawal of major operators since the 2021 coup has left future investments uncertain. However, PTTEP's ongoing and planned activities in the Yadana and Zawtika gas projects highlight some potential for continued operations, crucial for Thailand's gas supply. Thailand's oil and gas sector continues to struggle with declining reserves and limited new discoveries. The focus remains on maintaining production from key fields like Erawan and Bongkot. Future exploration may target untapped blocks in the Thailand-Cambodia Overlapping Claim Areas, contingent on diplomatic resolutions.A The outlook for upstream oilA and gas production hinges on the further exploration of the Malampaya gas field. The recent agreement to extend Malampaya contract for another 15 years could offer potential upside to gas reserves. Nonetheless, the Philippines still faces a challenging task to reverse declining oil and gas production from depleting fields. Heightened maricreated_at disputes between the Philippines and Mainland China are expected to deter foreign investments and further delay cooperation between the two countries to carry out joint explorations in South China Sea.A Overall, Southeast Asia's upstream oil and gas industry is set for substantial investment and exploration activity in 2025, driven by strategic discoveries and government-backed production targets, particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia.A\n\nMalaysia Seeking To Boost Oil & Gas Production in Peninsular Malaysia\n  Source: Petronas, company press releases, BMI   \n"

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:\nVietnam's island reclamation activities in the South China Sea made titles in 2024 with a record area of land created and several airstrips planned on the new islands.\nThe Washington-based Asia Maricreated_at Transparency Initiative, or AMTI, said that between November 2023 and June 2024, Hanoi created 280 hectares (692 acres) of new land across 10 of 27 features it occupies in the Spratly archipelago.\nAMTI also reported that three to four runways might be planned for different features.\n\"Three years from when it first began, Vietnam is still surprising observers with the ever-increasing scope of its dredging and landfill in the Spratly Islands,\" the think tank said.\nHanoi's island building program stemmed from a Communist Party resolution in 2007 on maricreated_at strategy toward the year 2020, according to Carlyle Thayer, a Vietnam expert at the University of New South Wales in Australia.\nThe resolution set out an integrated strategy to develop coastal areas, an exclusive economic zone, and 27 land features in the South China Sea with the objective that this area would contribute between 53% and 55% of the gross domestic product by 2020, Thayer said.\nIt was only in 2021 that Vietnam began a modest program of landfill and infrastructure construction on its features in the Spratly Islands, Thayer said.\nBy that created_at, China had completed the construction of its \"Big Three\" artificial islands in the South China Sea Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi reefs and equipped them with runways and military facilities.\nThe island-building program focuses mainly on the so-called integrated marine economy, the analyst told Radio Free Asia, noting that there are only modest defenses such as pillboxes, trenches and gun emplacements on the newly developed features.\nRisk of tension\nVietnam has long been wary of causing tension with China but its increasing assertiveness had led to a re-think in Hanoi.\n\"Vietnam has not placed major weapon systems on its land features that would threaten China's artificial islands,\" Thayer said.\n\"But no doubt the rise in Chinese aggressiveness against the Philippines after the election of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. reinforced Vietnam's determination not to leave its island features in the Spratlys exposed.\"\n\"Vietnamese occupation also serves to deny China the opportunity to occupy these features as China did when it took control of unoccupied Mischief Reef belonging to the Philippines in 1984,\" he added.\nCarl Schuster, a retired U.S. navy captain based in Hawaii, said that on the surface, Vietnam and China appeared to have strong, positive relations but \"at its roots, the relationship is one of distrust and for Vietnam, pragmatism.\"\n\"Vietnam has noticed that the PRC is most aggressive around undefended or uninhabited islands and islets,\" Schuster said, referring to China by its official name the People's Republic of China.\n\"Hanoi therefore sees expanding, hardening and expanding the garrisons on its own islands as a means of deterring PRC aggression.\"\nYet Vietnam's island building activities have been met with criticism from some neighboring countries.\nMalaysia sent a rare letter of complaint to Vietnam in October 2024 over its development of an airstrip on Barque Canada reef a feature that Malaysia also claims in the South China Sea.\nAnother neighbor, the Philippines, announced that it was closely \"monitoring\" Vietnam's island building activities.\nIn July 2023, the pro-China Manila created_ats published two reports on what it called \"Vietnam's militarization of the South China Sea,\" citing leaked masterplans on island development from the Vietnamese defense ministry.\nShortly after the publication, a group of Filipinos staged a protest in front of the Vietnamese embassy in Manila, vandalizing the Vietnamese flag. The incident did not escalate but soured the usually friendly relationship between the two neighbors.\nReasonable response\nThe Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN has long been negotiating with China on a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and the consensus is to observe the status quo in the disputed waterway and maintain peace.\nAzmi Hassan, a senior fellow at Malaysia's Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research, explained that status quo means \"there shouldn't be any new reclamation, especially in the Spratly or Paracel Islands as new reclamation could create some instability.\"\n\"But in the case of Vietnam, it's very difficult to stop them because the Chinese have been doing it for many years and China has the longest airstrip and the biggest reclamation on Mischief Reef,\" Hassan said.\nMalaysia also built an airstrip on Pulau Layang-Layang, known internationally as Swallow Reef, which is claimed by several countries including Vietnam.\n\"So it's very hard to criticize Vietnam because Malaysia has done it, China has done it, and the Philippines has been doing it for quite some created_at,\" the analyst said.\nGreg Poling, AMTI's director, told RFA that in his opinion, Hanoi's goal with the development of features in the South China Sea \"appears to be to allow it to better patrol its exclusive economic zone by sea and air in the face of China's persistent presence.\"\n\"That seems a reasonable and proportionate response,\" he said.\nThe U.S. government has taken no public position on the issue but the Obama administration did push for a construction freeze by all parties, Poling said.\nThen-U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter visited Hanoi in June 2015 and discussed the issue during a meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart, Phung Quang Thanh and, according to the transcript of a press briefing.\nCarter was told that \"the government of Vietnam is considering ... a permanent halt to reclamation and further militarization\" of the new islands.\n\"But that was when the prime goal was to stop China's island building,\" Poling said. \"Obviously that didn't work so now I think the U.S. and other parties understand that Vietnam is not likely to agree to unilaterally restrain itself when China has already done it.\"\nIn 2015, Vietnam still insisted that it was only carrying out activities \"to enhance and to consolidate the islands that are under our sovereignty.\"\nIn the late Gen. Phung Quang Thanh's words: \"We do not expand those islands, we just consolidate to prevent the soil erosion because of the waves, to improve the livelihood of our people and of our personnel who are working and living there.\"\n\"And for the submerged features, we have built small houses and buildings, which can accommodate only three people, and we do not expand those features. And the scope and the characteristics of those features are just civilian in nature,\" Thanh told Carter.\nBad investment?\nFast forward 10 years, and Vietnam has reclaimed a total area of about half of what China has built up and among the 10 largest features in the Spratlys, five are being developed by Hanoi with an unknown, but no doubt massive budget.\nThe island building program, however, has been received positively by the Vietnamese public.\nPhotos and video clips from the now popular Bai Thuyen Chai, Dao Tien Nu and Phan Vinh or Barque Canada, Tennent and Pearson reefs respectively have been shared and admired by millions of social media users as proof of Vietnamese military might and economic success even if the construction comes at a big environmental cost.\nSouth China Sea researcher Dinh Kim Phuc told RFA Vietnamese that despite the environmental damage, Vietnam's actions \"must happen\" and are necessary for \"strategic defense\" as long as China does not quit its expansionist ambitions.\nHowever, some experts have warned against the effectiveness of such artificial islands from a military standpoint.\n\"Like Chinese-built islands, Vietnamese built islands are, by nature, small areas of land that are difficult to defend against modern land-attack missile capabilities, and given their low altitude, they are at the mercy of salt water corrosion of structures and systems ashore,\" said Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst in defense strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n\"So as with Chinese experience, the Vietnamese will also struggle to base military capabilities on these islands for extended periods of created_at,\" Davis told RFA.\n\"In the longer term, they are also going to be vulnerable to the effects of climate change - most notably, sea level rise, which could quickly swamp a low-level landmass and see it become unusable.\"\n\"These challenges are why I don't worry too much about those Chinese-built bases in the South China Sea, as I think Beijing has made a bad investment there,\" the analyst added.\nAMTI's Poling said rising sea levels and storm surge would threaten all the islands \"but it is something that both China and Vietnam are likely able to cope with by continually refilling the islands and building up higher sea walls.\"\nThat would entail considerable costs and cause even more environmental impact.\nIman Muttaqin Yusof in Kuala Lumpur contributed to this story\nEdited by Mike Firn\n"

At the same created_at, the Philippines solicited countries outside the region to organize a so-called joint patrol to deliberately undermine peace and stability in the waters.\nThe latest provocative moves of the Philippines came after Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo's first phone call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Jan 22, in which the two sides talked about China's \"dangerous and destabilizing actions\" in the South China Sea, according to a readout of the US State Department on the talks.\nRubio \"underscored the United States' ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defense Treaty\", the State Department said in the statement.\nNotably, the talks between Manalo and Rubio came one week after the 10th Meeting of the China-Philippines Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea. In the meeting, the two sides had a candid and constructive exchange of views on the situation in the South China Sea. Both sides reiterated the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the waters, believing that this serves the common interests of the two countries and the region.\nThe two sides also agreed to strengthen sea-related dialogue, communication and contact, properly handle maricreated_at disputes and differences, and continue to promote practical maricreated_at cooperation in various fields such as marine science and technology, and environmental protection.\nBut the continuous worsening of the situation in the South China Sea after the Manalo-Rubio talks, which followed one day after the latter hosted a Quad foreign ministers' meeting in Washington, indicates that the Ferdinand Marcos Jr government of the Philippines, after a brief respite of wait and see during the power transition in Washington, has decided to continue its tricks of saying one thing and doing another. It has apparently bet on the new US administration carrying on its predecessor's support for the Philippines.\nWith Japan, Australia and India, which were all active participants in the previous US administration's \"Indo-Pacific\" strategy, all adopting a more balanced foreign policy when it comes to relations with the US and China, it is high created_at Manila weighed the possible gains and losses of continuing the one-sided pro-US diplomacy that has actually brought the Philippines nothing but risks and uncertainties, and isolated it from the rest of the region over the past more than two years.\nAs Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said, China's activities in the relevant waters are reasonable and legal and beyond reproach. The US is not a party to the South China Sea issue and has no right to intervene in maricreated_at issues between China and the Philippines. The US-Philippines military cooperation must not undermine China's sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests in the South China Sea, and must not be used to endorse the Philippines' illegal claims. China will continue to take necessary measures to firmly defend its territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests and maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.\n \n"

It followed Tuesday's PLA air patrol over the contested Scarborough Shoal - known as Huangyan Island in China. \nThe Chinese military activities came after the Philippines and the United States held a joint patrol over the South China Sea on Tuesday, in an area close to the exclusive economic zone claimed by Manila. \nResponding to that exercise yesterday, the PLA said Manila had \"colluded with extraterritorial countries\" and undermined regional stability, and that China's military would defend the ­country's territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights. \n\"It is aimed at providing a ­pretext for its illegal claims in the South China Sea and ­undermining China's legitimate maricreated_at rights and interests in the region,\" Southern Theatre Command spokesman Senior Colonel Tian Junli said. \nThe latest patrol came after state broadcaster CCTV on Tuesday aired footage of a PLA destroyer fleet conducting an exercise in the Pacific Ocean, soon after Beijing and Manila traded barbs over a Chinese navy transit through the Basilan Strait earlier this week. \nThe CCTV report showed the Zunyi Type 055 destroyer, Hengyang Type 054A frigate and Weishanhu Type 903 ­replenishment vessel carrying out far-sea combat training at an undisclosed Pacific location over Lunar New Year. \nThey were the same three ­warships seen sailing through the 18km Basilan Strait - which ­separates the Philippine islands of Mindanao and Basilan - towards the Sulu Sea on Sunday. \nThe PLA warships, led by the stealth guided-missile destroyer, play an important role in China's blue-water naval ambitions. \nTuesday's report highlighted young sailors taking part in the drill who were on their first deployment. \nAccording to former PLA instructor Song Zhongping, the message of the state television report was that the Basilan Strait transit \"was just a routine naval exercise and should not be ­misinterpreted as a deterrence manoeuvre, or a show of force\". \nOn Monday, the Philippines condemned the transit as \"not consistent with the principles of innocent passage\", while China claimed it fully complied with international law and norms and accused Manila of politicising routine naval movements. \nSome observers said the ­timing of the CCTV report - soon after Manila objected to the ­warships sailing through the strait - suggested Beijing wanted to downplay the transit.

    "text": "\nTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A flurry of naval drills surrounding the Philippines involving the United States and its partners has prompted complaints from Beijing, which claims the entire South China Sea and accuses Manila of colluding with others to destabilize the region.\nThe U.S. 7th Fleet based in Japan said forces from Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and the U.S. conducted a “multilateral Maricreated_at Cooperative Activity” within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone on Wednesday.\nSuch drills “strengthen the interoperability of our defense/armed forces doctrines, tactics, techniques, and procedures,\" the fleet said in a news release. The maneuvers were taking place within the Philippines’ zone, but the fleet gave no details on the exact location.\nMore exercises involving the U.S., Japan and France were planned for later this week in the Philippines Sea, which China does not claim.\nThat exercise “is designed to advance coordination and cooperation between French, Japanese and U.S. maricreated_at forces while simultaneously demonstrating capabilities in multi-domain operations,” the fleet said.\nThe U.S. aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, French carrier Charles De Gaulle and Japan's Izumo-class multi-functional destroyer Kaga will take part in the drill starting Saturday, along with their escorts and air wings, the fleet said.\nFrance's participation is especially significant because of the distance from its home base, 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles) away in Toulouse, commander of the Carrier Strike Group Rear Adm. Jacques Mallard was quoted as saying.\nMeanwhile, Tian Junli, spokesperson for China's Southern Theater Command, accused the Philippines of “colluding with outside countries to organize ‘so-called joint patrols’, \" which he said ”destabilize the region,\" Chinese state media said on Thursday.\nTian said the Philippines actions were “an attempt to endorse its ‘illegal claims’ in the South China Sea and ”undermine China’s maricreated_at rights and interests.\" He specifically pointed to U.S.-Philippines joint patrols on Tuesday and said China had carried out its own patrols in the region on Wednesday.\nChina is one of six regional powers that claims the strategic South China Sea in part or in whole, ignoring a ruling by a United Nations-backed court that tossed out most of its claims and building human-made islands equipped with airstrips and other infrastructure of military use. China's coast guard and maricreated_at militia frequently clash with ships from fellow claimants Vietnam and the Philippines.\nThough it claims not to disrupt shipping or overflights in the sea, through which an estimated $5 trillion in global trade transits each year, China is adamantly opposed to foreign military shipping in the area.\nThe waterway is also believed to be sitting atop vast undersea deposits of oil and gas and while China says it wants to come to a negotiated agreement about the use of the sea, such efforts have made little progress.\nChina says the U.S. and other countries that don't border on the sea should have no say in affairs concerning it, although the U.S. — which takes no formal stand on sovereignty issues involving the sea — has maintained bases and alliances in the region long before China made its formal claim to sovereignty using the so-called “eight dash line.”\nBeijing is especially angered over U.S. “freedom of navigation operations” in which Navy ships sail close to Chinese-held maricreated_at features to show Washington does not recognize China's sovereignty claims.\n"

    "text": "\nMANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine Senate president said Thursday the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte will begin after Congress reopens in June and vowed to avoid a repeat of stalled 2001 impeachment proceedings that sparked massive protests and forced a president to step down.\nThe previous day, the House of Representatives impeached Duterte, daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte, on a range of accusations that include plotting to assassinate the president, large-scale corruption, and failing to strongly denounce China’s aggressive actions against Filipino forces in the disputed South China Sea.\nAt least 215 of the House's more than 300 legislators signed the complaint — significantly more than the required number — allowing it to be transmitted immediately to the Senate, which will serve as the impeachment court. The impeachment came on the last day of congressional session before a four-month break.\nSara Duterte didn’t immediately comment, but her brother Rep. Paolo Duterte said the impeachment was “a clear act of political persecution.” Rival lawmakers maneuvered to quickly collect signatures and push a “baseless impeachment case” to the Senate, he said.\nSenate President Francis Escudero said under the law an impeachment court can only be convened and senators sworn in as jurors when the Senate resumes its session on June 2.\n\"Legally, it cannot be done,” Escudero said in a news conference when asked if a special Senate session could be called to start the impeachment trial earlier.\nNonetheless, many activists and critics argue the text could do more to provide a swift trial.\n“The Senate’s foot-dragging on the impeachment process vs. Sara Duterte will be a roadblock to the pursuit of accountability,” said Cristina Palabay, a leader of a human rights alliance.\nThe move by House legislators, many of them allies of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., deepens a bitter political rift between the two highest leaders of one of Asia’s most rambunctious democracies.\nThe signatories included the president’s son, Rep. Sandro Marcos, and House Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president’s cousin. The petition asks the Senate remove Duterte from office and ban her from holding public office for life.\nIn a Southeast Asian country long plagued by political divisions, impeachment trials can become politically volatile. In early 2001, an impeachment trial of then President Joseph Estrada on allegations including bribery and corruption stalled over a vote not to open an envelope containing records of his suspected bank account.\nMassive protests ensued, eventually forcing Estrada to step down.\nAsked how that could be avoided in the impeachment trial of Duterte, Escudero said steps were being taken early to ensure “the credibility and impartiality of the impeachment court.” No side should be prevented from expressing their positions, he added.\nThe impeachment complaint against the vice president focused on a death threat she made against the president, his wife and the House speaker last year, irregularities in the use of her office’s intelligence funds and her failure to stand up to Chinese aggression in the disputed South China Sea, according to proponents of the petition.\nShe told a Nov. 23 online news conference that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Romualdez if she were killed, a statement she said wasn’t a joke. She later said it wasn't a threat, but an expression of concern for her own safety.\nAllegations of graft and corruption against her also emanated from a monthslong and televised House investigation last year on the alleged misuse of 612.5 million pesos ($10.5 million) of confidential and intelligence funds received by Duterte’s offices as vice president and education secretary. She later left the education post as her political differences with Marcos deepened.\nShe has denied any wrongdoing but refused to respond to questions in detail during the tense televised hearings.\nThe impeachment complaint accused Duterte of undermining the Marcos government’s policies, including by describing the administration’s handling of territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea as a “fiasco.” The complaint also mentioned her silence over China’s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters.\n"

    "text": "\n Both countries discussed \"the importance of re-establishing deterrence in the South China Sea\"   \nNewly appointed US defence chief Pete Hegseth has reassured the Philippines that Washington remains \"ironclad\" in standing by the two countries' mutual defence treaty amid questions over the Donald Trump administration's level of commitment towards Manila and the broader region. \nA readout from the US Department of Defence said Hegseth and Philippine Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jnr held an introductory call on Wednesday to discuss \"the importance of re-establishing deterrence in the South China Sea\" and enhancing the capabilities of the Philippine military. \n\"The Secretary reaffirmed the ironclad US commitment to the 1951 Mutual Defence Treaty and its importance for maintaining a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\" according to the readout, which was shared with the media on Thursday. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nPhilippine Defence Department Assistant Secretary Arsenio Andolong said Teodoro assured Hegseth of Manila's commitment to working closely with the US on shared defence priorities and strengthening deterrence in the West Philippine Sea, Manila's term for the part of the South China Sea that it considers its maricreated_at territory. \nWhile Teodoro did not explicitly mention China, his call for deterrence against \"coercive and destabilising actions\" in the West Philippine Sea was an allusion to Beijing's activities in the disputed waterway, where Chinese vessels had repeatedly challenged the Philippines' maricreated_at operations. \nSome observers have questioned Trump's resolve to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific after he did not mention the region on January 20 during his first address upon taking office, noting that he had earlier invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration. \nThe doubts were partly fuelled by Trump's appointment of John Byers - who previously suggested offering to remove US military forces from the Philippines as leverage in negotiations with Beijing - to oversee defence policy for South and Southeast Asia. \nThe Trump administration also paused almost all foreign aid last week, including funds earmarked for the Philippines. Government officials in Manila have said they do not know whether the freeze would impact the US$500 million in military aid for this year that was promised by the previous Joe Biden administration. \nAs for the Balikatan, the annual joint US-Philippine military training exercises that usually take place from April to May, military officials told This Week in Asia that they assumed these would continue since their US counterparts had given no other indication. \nArmed Forces of the Philippines spokeswoman Margareth Padilla told This Week in Asia on Tuesday that the military was under the impression that the Balikatan exercises would continue because funding for them was authorised under their mutual defence treaty and not linked to the military aid. \nMilitary public affairs chief Xerxes Trinidad also told This Week in Asia that plans for this year's Balikatan were continuing. Its training objectives were geared towards a \"full battle system test\" and intended to address gaps in the training of US and Philippine soldiers, Trinidad said. \n\"The planning [for the 40th Balikatan this year] is ongoing and we have not received word that it will not push through,\" he added. \nPadilla said that Filipino soldiers had continued to train alongside their US counterparts even after Trump and his officials took office. \nThe latest was on Tuesday when three Philippine FA-50 fighter jets and two US supersonic Rockwell B-1A Lancer heavy bombers flew over parts of the disputed Scarborough Shoal during a joint air exercise to simulate intercepting an enemy aircraft trespassing into Philippine air territory. \nThe Philippines considers the shoal a part of its maricreated_at territory but China has formally claimed it through a filing with the United Nations. \nThe air exercise was preceded by a visit to Manila of the US Pacific Air Forces Commander Kevin Schneider on January 28 to discuss \"interoperability\" with Arthur Cordura, the Philippine Air Force commanding general. \nBoth military leaders \"emphasised the importance of joint exercises and training programmes in enhancing the operational capabilities of both forces\" including maricreated_at activities, Philippine Air Force spokeswoman Colonel Maria Consuelo Castillo said. \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "text": "\nMANILA - The Philippines, a strategic U.S. ally in Asia, was plunged into a political crisis after the lower house on Wednesday impeached Vice President Sara Duterte, daughter of former head of state Rodrigo Duterte, accusing her of several crimes including a plot to assassinate the president, grand corruption and failing to vigorously denounce China's aggressive actions against Philippine forces in the disputed South China Sea.\nThe act, carried out by lawmakers in the House of Representatives, many of whom are allies of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.-the dictator's son-deepens a political feud between the two top leaders and clans in one of Asia's most embattled democracies.\nDuterte was facing four complaints over his alleged embezzlement of millions in public funds and his claims that he had made plans to assassinate Ferdinand Marcos, his wife and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who is Marcos' cousin.\nMarcos has fostered defense ties with his ally the United States, while the vice president's father, Rodrigo Duterte, established warm relations with China and Russia during his stormy term, which ended in 2022.\nOf the 306 lawmakers in the lower house, 215 signed the impeachment petition against the vice president, significantly more than the number required to allow the petition to be quickly transmitted to the Senate, which will serve as a tribunal to try the vice president, House secretary general Reginald Velasco said ahead of a four-month recess. Applause erupted in the chamber after the official announcement of the results.\nAmong the signatories of the impeachment petition were the President's son, Rep. Sandro Marcos, and his cousin, House Speaker Martin Romualdez. The petition urged the Senate to become an impeachment court to try the vice president, \"issue a judgment of conviction,\" remove her from office and bar her from holding public office.\n\"Duterte's conduct during his term clearly shows gross disloyalty against the public trust and tyrannical abuse of power which, taken together, show his clear unfitness to hold public office and his infidelity to the laws and the 1987 Constitution,\" read the petition, referring to Duterte.\nDuterte will now face a trial in the Philippine Senate when Congress reconvenes in June. A two-thirds vote is needed for conviction, and if convicted Duterte will be impeached and disqualified from holding any public office. She may also face criminal and civil charges in court.\nSo far, the vice president has not commented on the House's decision to impeach her, but her brother, Rep. Paolo Duterte, said the move was \"a clear act of political persecution.\" He said he was \"appalled and enraged by the desperate and politically motivated efforts\" to impeach his sister. \"If the Marcos administration thinks it can force this mock impeachment without consequences, it is gravely mistaken,\" he warned in a statement. \"Mark my words: this reckless abuse of power will not end in their favor.\"\nRival lawmakers maneuvered to quickly collect signatures and push \"a baseless impeachment case\" before the Senate, he said.\nDuterte ran as Marcos' running mate in 2022, with a campaign slogan in favor of unity in the deeply divided Southeast Asian country.Both are scions of leaders who have long been in the crosshairs of human rights groups, but their strong regional support bases combined to give them a landslide victory.\nMarcos is the son and bears the same name as the late dictator, ousted in a pro-democracy uprising in 1986. Duterte, the vice president's father and Marcos Jr.'s predecessor, launched a deadly anti-drug offensive that is already being investigated by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity. The surprise political alliance quickly withered after his electoral victory.\n\"This is dragging the whole country into political chaos,\" warned Aries Arugay, chairman of the political science department at the University of the Philippines. \"Unlike in the United States, here she has no critical role as vice president. So why? The political motivation here is to stop the eventuality of a Sara Duterte presidency,\" he added.\nDuterte had publicly talked about running for the presidency when Marcos' single six-year term ends in 2028.\nThe accusations against Duterte\nThe impeachment call against the vice president, seen as a possible presidential contender once Marcos' 6-year term ends in 2028, centers on a death threat she made against the president, his wife and the Speaker of the House last year, irregularities in the use of intelligence funds and for not raising her voice against China's aggression over the disputed South China Sea.\nShe openly acknowledged in a Nov. 23 online press conference that she had hired an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Romualdez if she was killed, a warning that, she said, was no joke.\nShe later pointed out that she was not threatening him, but was expressing concern for her own safety. However, her statements prompted the start of an investigation and sparked nationwide security concerns.\nThe corruption and bribery allegations against her also stemmed from a months-long, televised House investigation into the alleged diversion of $10.5 million in confidential and intelligence funds received by Duterte's offices when she held the posts of vice president and education secretary. She has since left the education post after her political differences with Marcos deepened.\nShe has also been accused of illicit enrichment and for failing to declare her assets as required by law. Last year she refused to answer detailed questions in tense televised hearings.\nThe impeachment petition accused Duterte of undermining Marcos policies, including his description of the government's handling of territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea, which he called \"a fiasco.\" The request also mentions his silence on China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters.\n\"His obvious evasive attitude and silence on the West Philippine Sea issue, an issue that affects the core of Philippine sovereignty, contrasts diametrically with his loquacity on other issues,\" reads the impeachment request, which uses the name given by the Philippines to the disputed waters.\nDuterte repeatedly accused Marcos, his wife and Romualdez of corruption, of exercising weak leadership and of trying to shut her up due to speculation that he might seek the presidency in 2028.\nMany citizens are fed up with the Marcos and Duterte dynasties, and believe the political drama distracts the leadership from the major problems afflicting the country, such as poverty and unemployment. The approval ratings of Marcos and Duterte have dropped significantly in recent months.\nTHE NATIONAccording to  the criteria of. Learn More       \n"

    "text": "\nNewly released Philippine Coast Guard videos show Chinese coast guard ships remaining in South China Sea waters within Manila's exclusive economic zone west of Luzon, where they have lingered for the past month, PCG officials said.\nIn video footage taken from a PCG airplane over the weekend and released on Monday, several Chinese coast guard ships were tracked sailing in waters near Manila-claimed Scarborough Shoal, known as Bajo de Masinloc in the Philippines, according to Filipino officials.\nOn Sunday, two China Coast Guard ships - CCG 3301 and CCG 3104 - were also tracked only 34 nautical miles off the coast of Pangasinan, a province on the west coast of Luzon, the main island in the northern Philippines.\nThe PCG said it immediately deployed an aircraft to identify the foreign ships and issued radio challenges but those were ignored, according to officials. The Philippine Coast Guard also dispatched two vessels to the area.\nLocated about 125 nautical miles (232 km) from Luzon, Scarborough Shoal is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino fishermen but it has been under China's de facto control since 2012.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard is committed to preventing the normalization of the People's Republic of China's (PRC) illegal deployment of maricreated_at forces in the region, the agency said in a statement.\nThe BRP Teresa Magbanua, a local coast guard ship, has been actively challenging the presence of China Coast Guard 5901, which is now about 117 nautical miles from the country's coast, according to officials.\nDubbed The Monster, the CCG 5901 is the world's largest coast ship. The Philippine coast guard statement did not say how the Teresa Magbanua was challenging its bigger foreign counterpart.\nToday marks the 30th consecutive day of the China Coast Guard's illegal presence in the waters off Zambales, the PCG said in its statement Saturday, referring to another province on Luzon's west coast.\nThe refusal of the Chinese vessel to leave the Philippine EEZ is a blatant disregard for international law and the established rules-based order, it said.\nChinese navy ships off southern Philippines\nMeanwhile, the Philippine Navy said it escorted three Chinese naval warships, including a cruiser-guided missile class vessel, out of Philippine waters on Monday. The vessels were first monitored Sunday off the coast of the southern Philippine provinces of Zamboanga and Basilan.\nThe said PLA [People's Liberation Army] navy vessels transited without prior diplomatic coordination and maintained an unusually slow speed of four to five knots, said Maj. Orlando Aylon Jr., a regional military spokesman based in Zamboanga.\nThe three People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy vessels seen by Philippine authorities included a Jianki Class Frigate II, a Renhai Class Cruiser Guided Missile and a Type 903 Fuchi Class Replenishment Oiler.\nThis is not consistent with the principles of innocent passage which requires continuous and expeditious passage and that the vessels should not linger in archipelagic waters longer than necessary, said Lt. Gen. Antonio Nafarrete, chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines' Western Mindanao Command.\nChina defended the passage of its naval vessels in the area, saying they conducted training exercises in the open sea.\nThe Chinese naval vessels' passage through the Basilan Strait is in full compliance with ... international law and practice, a spokesperson for the Chinese PLA Southern Theater Command said on Monday.\nThe Philippines' act of smearing and hyping up the Chinese naval vessels' normal passage through the Basilan Strait has seriously undermined the normal navigation rights of other countries including China, the spokesperson added.\nBeijing's taking possession of Scarborough Shoal forced Manila to file a lawsuit at the world court in The Hague 13 years ago.\nIn 2016, an international arbitration tribunal ruled in Manila's favor but Beijing has never acknowledged that decision.\nGeopolitical analyst Julio Amador III, who closely monitors the South China Sea, said it was too early to determine the Chinese navy vessels' intentions but he noted that the principle of freedom of navigation applied.\nThe same could also be said about China's monster ship. As long as it maintained its distance in the periphery of Scarborough, that should not escalate the tension in the area, Amador said.\nBut if it goes inside the lagoon and then patrols while challenging our claims, then there are grounds for protest, he told BenarNews.\nThe only difference between that ship and the CCG ships in 2012 is the size.\nHe was referring to the first incident when Chinese vessels entered the area and unleashed an international crisis that later resulted in Manila's filing of a lawsuit against Beijing.\nThe monster ship's presence there is to remind us that they are making claims on Scarborough.\nThey want control of the waters, Amador said.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

More and more analysts have been flagging the South China Sea as a potential flashpoint, and investors themselves have lately taken notice.\nI prefer to see the currently poor state of our relations with China as part of a continuum that, hopefully, is on the cusp of taking the next step.\nDRAWING THE RED LINE\nTo be sure, I am glad that our government has asserted our rights to the West Philippine Sea, as provided by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nI had long wondered when we would stand up to the bully up north, even if not exactly as Vietnam and India had done. China, which singled us out to demonstrate its power to others in the region since we have the weakest external defense capability in much of Asia, respects only force. Like any bully, it will not respect anyone who will not defend himself.\nWe have Beijing to thank for our belatedly realizing that a defenseless state is one that has no clout — I blame past administrations up to 2010 for thinking that we could rely completely on the US for cover against aggressors — and thus for putting us on the road to achieving a minimum credible defense capability.\nWe do not have the same armed mettle as Vietnam, but what we lacked in arms we kinda made up for legally at The Hague. One fights a bully with whatever one has, and in our case, it is international law.\nThe question is whether we have been building on that legal victory since then. Even former President Rodrigo Duterte had said in public on more than one occasion that the arbitral ruling was already part of jurisprudence, hence, he did not have to assert it (whether that laid-back stance posed legal risks for us remains to be seen).\nI recall that Mr. Duterte, in at least two televised remarks in his last year in office, could barely hide his annoyance with China’s then- unreported bullying of our troops in those waters (that was when I first sensed — well, besides the fact that only a handful of its development funding promises had materialized as his administration drew to a close — that Beijing had not been reciprocating our love language since mid-2016). Our coast guard later on confirmed that incidents with Chinese forces at sea had occurred even under Mr. Duterte, who just didn’t want to ruffle Beijing’s feathers by publicizing them.\nAs I have said before, I have no illusions about the designs of the other superpower, the United States of America. Remember that, as Reuters had reported, the US undertook an aggressive disinformation drive vs Chinese vaccines at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic right here in our country and Filipinos fell for that spiel hook, line, and sinker. That incident serves as a created_atly reality check against blindly trusting even our allies.\nPUSHED TO THE WALL\nBut then, it not the US now that is pushing us (particularly, our subsistence fishermen) to the wall in our waters (I am saying it is “ours” liberally, because anything beyond 12 nautical miles from our baselines is not our territory, even as we do have the sole right to explore and extract resources beyond that point to within 200 nautical miles from baselines).\nHence, this issue is an existential one for affected fisherfolk and, if one remembers that the suspected oil and gas deposits under Recto/Reed Bank in the West Philippine Sea are supposed to make up for the fast- dwindling stock at the Malampaya gas field (which is expected to run dry in two years), for our entire economy as well.\nChina’s actions have forced us back into the US’ arms. Some quarters have scored this move but always fail to suggest a viable alternative course (as if we could defend ourselves on our own right now). Beijing’s spokesmen have long accused the Philippines of falling for Washington’s “Cold War mentality,” but the former has bared exactly that mindset by failing to acknowledge that smaller states like us have our own interests in this issue.\nWhen Beijing speaks of the need for “peace” in the region, it is talking about Pax Sinica — “peace” on its terms which, it is turning out for some of us, would be tantamount to the peace of the grave.\nThere was a created_at in the past when I applauded any move towards China in order to balance our almost servile reliance on the United States, thinking that a neighbor would understand our needs better than anyone from across the Pacific.\nPersonally, I would rather that we were not put in this position — because the US has manipulated/failed/abandoned us in the past whenever doing so served its own designs — but as the adage goes: in politics, there are no permanent friends, only permanent interests.\nAnd while Beijing wields tremendous economic and armed clout, it still has much to learn about statecraft with smaller states it could otherwise woo to its side.\nCLOCK TICKING\nBroadsheets reported the other week that the current government is now weighing which international panel would be the best venue for our next step after the July 2016 victory at The Hague.\nWell, it’s about created_at.\nOfficials are now talking about the reportedly massive environmental damage caused by China’s island-building and harvesting of resources like clams within our exclusive economic zone (EEZ). True, Vietnam has occupied the most number of islands in the South China Sea — and presumably damaged the environment — but it does not push us around in our own waters, nor does it bar our fishermen from their traditional grounds. Hence, it is not our primary adversary on this count. In fact, we deal with Hanoi constructively despite our differences.\nChina may even file its own environmental complaint against us for running two ships aground (of which one remains) on Ayungin Shoal. In an interview last year with the ABS-CBN News Channel, former Associate Justice Francis H. Jardeleza welcomed that prospect, saying that the Philippines would pay much smaller damages should it lose that case anyway, compared with what China stands to be dunned for environmental damage due to its island-building and unrestricted harvesting of marine life within the Philippines’ EEZ. In terms of optics, these cases would serve to further draw international attention to the scale of the impact of China’s aggression.\nThe problem, Mr. Jardeleza said then, is that the current administration has not filed any such case now that it is halfway into its term. But while the current created_attable is increasingly tight, it should be recalled that the administration of the late former president Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III filed its arbitration case at The Hague in January 2013 — also in midterm — and secured its legal victory in July three years later.\nSo long as Beijing keeps treating us the same way in those waters, this will be a logical next step, as it builds on the 2016 arbitral ruling.\nLEARNING\nWith the return of a Duterte to Malacañang being a real prospect come 2028 for now, there are fears among some quarters of a swing back to an overly pro-Beijing stance (Beijing certainly hopes so, I’m sure, and is actively working for that — gauging from recent reports of active surveillance within our territory).\nI prefer to see the changes in our policy towards Beijing and Washington as part of a continuum. From decades of allying with Washington (to the point that a Washington Post reporter told me once that it may do us some good to oppose the United States every now and then in order to gain respect), we really needed to see if hewing closer to China would serve us better. In hindsight, there was little value to that tack, except that it made folks in Washington sit up and take notice (instead of smugly assuming that the Philippines was in its pocket anyway).\nSwinging all the way back into Washington’s arms, however, is not advisable either. US President Donald Trump’s move to suspend and review foreign aid is a created_atly reminder of just how fleeting US support can be, pronouncements of how “ironclad” it is notwithstanding.\nSETTING THE STAGE\nThe current administration has an opportunity to strike a better balance for the rest of its term, or at least to set the stage for that after cementing our fallback to firmer international legal foundations, with alliances that serve to enforce the 2016 arbitral ruling, and stronger external defense capability.\nHopefully, we will soon find better footing (across strategic, economic, political, and other fields) in our relations with China.\nWe do have a bilateral consultation mechanism focused on the South China Sea which was established in May 2017, as Mr. Duterte agreed to Beijing’s demand that the Philippines limit moves to the bilateral level. Any success there has been slow in coming, with some quarters criticizing our agreement to notify China of our resupply missions as being tantamount to seeking Beijing’s permission.\nPerhaps there is a need to elevate our bilateral engagement in other areas, in order to give us a strategic sense of where we can move forward. After all, both Manila and Beijing have said that maricreated_at tensions do not constitute the totality of bilateral ties and, therefore, should not dictate progress in other fields.\nOur trade with and tourism numbers from China have fallen, although it is not clear just how much of these declines can be blamed on our maricreated_at row (what with 2024 ending with China consumer and business sencreated_atnt at an all-created_at low).\nAnd so, I’m glad we still mount business missions to China. While we never get the real score on the successes of these missions (the public can be given follow-up information on this), we can push for more. True, current tensions with our northern neighbor has jolted us to the need to diversify trade partners, especially with those with whom we have less bilateral strains. But it goes without saying that we can still maximize trade and other economic relations with China, being the second-biggest economy (that’s not going away, geopolitically).\nI have also always marveled at the way Indonesia’s political parties have maintained ties with the Chinese Communist Party (CPP), the formers’ anti-communist sencreated_atnts notwithstanding. While that would have been another conduit for bilateral initiatives, the Philippines may end up on the losing end here, since we do not have genuine, stable political parties that can hold their own when dealing with the CPP. We did form in 2020 a China-Philippines Political Parties Belt and Road Consultation Mechanism, but that seemed to have fizzled out with our change of administration. So, scratch that out, although there could still be regular engagement between our legislatures.\nAs we chart a new course, business has to be consulted more on the next steps. Every chat I have with leaders of business chambers leaves me with the impression that these folks are not consulted enough by those charting the next steps with China. That’s one policy-making blind spot that needs to be plugged. I’m sure those who have been doing business in China can offer valuable, unique insights to policy makers. And it won’t help our economy either if souring strategic relations erode their businesses.\nThen we could take advantage of next year’s meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which we are scheduled to chair. Initiatives could include teaming up with others with interests in or claims to parts of the South China Sea for a joint statement on this issue that is separate from the Senior Officials’ and Leaders’ statements which cap ASEAN meetings, since this regional organization has proven skittish in coming up with a more substantial common stand on this issue.\nFinally, we need more updates on gains in other areas of Philippine- China engagement. The only reason we seem to be bordering lately on Sinophobia is the spate of reports of maricreated_at clashes, Chinese drones and suspected spies that have hogged the titles. Perhaps those in charge of the other facets of our China ties can pick up the pace here.\nWILFREDO G. REYES was editor-in-chief of BusinessWorld from 2020 through 2023.\n"

    "text": "\nKuala Lampur, Feb. 6 -- - Recent critics have unfairly dismissed Malaysia's Asean chairmanship without acknowledging the proactive steps taken to enhance regional cooperation. Malaysia has already demonstrated strong leadership and strategic vision in addressing key challenges, fostering economic growth, and strengthening Asean's unity.\nMalaysia is committed to enhancing Asean's institutional capacity to respond more effectively to regional challenges. This includes efforts to streamline decision-making processes and improve coordination among Asean bodies to ensure faster and more decisive action on security, economic, and social issues. Malaysia is also advocating for a stronger Asean Secretariat with better resources to manage the region's expanding agenda.\nMalaysia is driving Asean's regional payment connectivity initiative, which aims to integrate digital payment systems across member states. This will facilitate smoother cross-border transactions, benefiting businesses and consumers alike. Additionally, Malaysia has pushed for the full implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to boost trade and investment flows, solidifying Asean's position as a global economic hub.\nRecognising the importance of food security, Malaysia is also working with Asean partners to develop a regional food supply resilience framework to safeguard against future disruptions, ensuring stable and affordable food supplies for all member states.\nMalaysia is reinforcing Asean's collective position on the South China Sea by advocating for a legally binding Code of Conduct (COC) with China to prevent conflicts and ensure freedom of navigation. Malaysia has also called for stronger maricreated_at security cooperation within Asean to counter illegal fishing and other threats that endanger regional stability.\nAs climate change increasingly threatens South-east Asia, Malaysia is leading efforts to strengthen Asean's disaster response capabilities through better coordination under the Asean Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance (AHA Centre). Malaysia is also advancing plans to expand climate financing mechanisms, allowing Asean member states to access more funding for green projects and disaster recovery efforts.\nMalaysia is championing initiatives to improve visa-free travel and mobility programmes for Asean citizens, making it easier for professionals, students, and workers to move across borders. This includes promoting mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) for skilled professionals, ensuring greater job opportunities and economic integration across the region.\nMalaysia's Asean chairmanship is off to a strong and proactive start, with clear initiatives to strengthen economic growth, regional security, institutional effectiveness, and climate resilience. Dismissing its efforts at this early stage ignores the long-term impact of these strategic actions. A fair assessment should focus on the tangible progress that will unfold throughout the year, rather than rushing to judgment after just one month.\n* Mohammed Taufiq Johari is Member of Parliament for Sungai Petani\n** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

    "text": "\nWith the arrival of Trump and his team of collaborators to the presidency of the United States, the world order is being violated. His political intentions weaken the purpose of the necessary global coordination, interdependence and respect for the sovereignty of States. It also dilutes the search for solutions to major global problems. Trump's central thesis is to concentrate power at the expense of other countries. Internally, he has already reduced spending on social development. These are signs of the deterioration of democracy and the rise of an oligarchy.\nIt is very serious that it is now being ignored that the tariff policies implemented by Herbert Hoover as president of the United States in the period 1929-1933 precipitated the Great Depression, deepened it and in the process ruined the whole world. First it was Canada, which, in order to defend itself, raised customs duties by 30%, and then all European countries followed suit.\nEurope, with the vast experience of Nazism, fascism and Soviet power in Eastern Europe, knows what racist and authoritarian governments are and the wars they provoke.\nNow Europeans repudiate Trump's attitude of pretending to take over Greenland. The Prime Minister of Denmark made public her rejection and the Danish government's decision to strengthen the island militarily. They are also surprised by his pretensions to turn Canada into a state of the United States and to invade Panama. Likewise, they question the weakness of the Democratic Party and the former president, Joe Biden, for allowing, with his lack of political operation, the arrival of Trump.\nIn another part of the world there is the axis of convenience made up of China, Iran, North Korea and Russia that is trying to challenge the power of the West.\nIn Asia, the country of greatest power is China, which draws inspiration from the rise of the United States as a power in the late 19th century. China asserts its presence in the surrounding seas. The South China Sea is already the area at greatest risk of war.\nThe wars in Ukraine and the Middle East will continue with their mixture of ancestral hatreds and the support of the powers involved.\nIn developing countries, difficulties are increasing due to protectionist scenarios. And there are 75 countries where poverty is the main feature. Climbing the global value chain through manufacturing exports has already become difficult. Faced with the technological challenge, these countries have to invest increasing amounts of resources in nutrition, health and education to increase human capital.\nIn Latin America, there is a need to combine public and private, domestic and foreign investments to produce economic and social development. This means affirming the State-Market as a formula for balance and conciliation.\nIn a conflictive world like the one we live in, where a new world order seems inevitable, but its foundations are not yet clear, it is useful to recall the words of Henry Morgenthau, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury at the Bretton Woods Conference, which gave rise to the post-war institutional framework. He said: \"Prosperity like peace is indivisible. We cannot afford to disperse it here or there among the fortunate or to enjoy it at the expense of others.\"\n"

    "text": "\nTaiwan wants to purchase radar aircraft from its security partner, the United States, to track its powerful neighbor China's stealth fighter jets, local media reported on Tuesday.\nThe Taiwanese Defense Ministry told Newsweek that it had no additional comments on the matter. The U.S. State Department said it would not comment on or confirm potential or pending arms transfers before they are notified to Congress.\nWhy It Matters\nCommunist China has long claimed that the self-ruled Taiwan is part of its own territory despite never having governed the island. The Chinese military, which has one type of stealth combat aircraft in service, officially unveiled two new radar-evading jets last year.\nWhile the U.S. does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Washington is required by the Taiwan Relations Act, which is part of its One China policy, to provide the island with defensive arms. China has called the Taiwan-related U.S. law \"illegal and invalid.\"\nWhat To Know\nCiting a source with knowledge of the matter, Taiwan's Central News Agency reported that Taipei has asked Washington for six E-2D Advanced Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft to replace its older E-2K Hawkeyes.\nThe Hawkeye and the Advanced Hawkeye aircraft have a radar rotodome attached to their upper fuselage, providing airborne early warning and airborne battle management, as well as command and control functions, according to their main operator, the U.S. Navy.\nNorthrop Grumman, the manufacturer of the Advanced Hawkeye aircraft, says that it can track over 3,000 air and ground targets simultaneously. It is equipped with Lockheed Martin's AN/APY-9 radar, which has a detection range of at least 300 nautical miles.\nStealth technology makes an aircraft less visible on radar but the AN/APY-9 radar has the ability to detect smaller targets at a greater range, making it a countermeasure to radar-evading aircraft such as the Chinese J-20, as well as the country's newly announced J-20S and J-35A jets.\n\"China urges the U.S. to immediately stop arming Taiwan and stop the dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,\" China's embassy in Washington, D.C., told Newsweek, warning that Beijing is justified in taking \"resolute countermeasures.\"\nWhat People Are Saying\nA U.S. State Department spokesperson told Newsweek: \"Consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, the United States will continue to enable Taiwan's self-defense capabilities.\"\nLiu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., told Newsweek: \"[U.S. arms sales to Taiwan] seriously undermine China's sovereignty and security interests, harm China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and send a gravely wrong message to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces.\"\nU.S. defense contractor Northrop Grumman, manufacturer of the E-2D aircraft, said: \"The E-2D gives the warfighter decision dominance through battlespace awareness, air and missile defense, and multiple sensor fusion capabilities in an airborne system.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nIt remains to be seen when the second Trump administration will approve its first arms sale to Taiwan. President Donald Trump suggested last summer that he would not defend Taiwan from China and the island should pay the U.S. for protection.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nU.S. Radar Aircraft Lands on Aircraft Carrier\nMass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Isaiah B.

    "text": "\n President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. acknowledged on Thursday, February 6, that the Philippines lacks the naval capability to drive away China's largest coast guard vessel from its waters, but maintained that Philippines forces will continue to challenge all intrusions in the West Philippine Sea.\n\"We don't have the means na paalisin. Buti kung meron tayong aircraft carrier na kasamang destroyer, frigate, at submarine na papupuntahin natin doon para matulak sila palayo. Wala tayong ganoon,\" Marcos said at a press conference.\n(We don't have the means to make them leave. But if we had an aircraft carrier with a destroyer, frigate, and submarine that we could send there to push them back, we don't have that.)\nThe president was referring to the continued presence of the China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel 5901, dubbed the \"monster\" for being the world's largest coast guard vessel. The 165-meter vessel has been part of a rotating fleet of Chinese ships continuously prowling the waters off Zambales since January 4.\nDespite the military disadvantage, Marcos maintained the Philippines will continue to defend its sovereign rights over its exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\n\"Kung sa palakihan at paramihan ng barko, malayo tayo sa China. Pero ang policy natin is we will continue to defend our sovereign territory and our terrirotial rights in the EEZ,\" Marcos said.\n(If it's about the size and number of ships, we are far behind China. But our policy is we will continue to defend our sovereign territory and our terrirotial rights in the EEZ.)\n\"When we detect the presence of a foreign vessel intruding into our coastal waters, we will deploy our ships, challenge them, and make sure they know what they are doing is illegal,\" he added.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) has been mounting daily challenges against the Chinese vessels, including through its flagship BRP Teresa Magbanua. In confrontations captured on video, Philippine forces are heard repeatedly warning the Chinese ships that they are violating the 2016 arbitral ruling that nullified Beijing's sweeping claims over nearly the entire South China Sea, along with the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act and UNCLOS.\nLast week, the PCG reported that the 97-meter BRP Teresa Magbanua kept CCG vessel 3304 - a smaller vessel than the \"monster\" - from advancing toward the Zambales coastline. The Philippine vessel reportedly held off the larger ship around 110-115 nautical miles from shore.\nMarcos noted that while China often counters these radio challenges by claiming they are conducting \"regular peacekeeping patrols,\" the Philippines' ship deployments will remain constant.\n\"Even if they ram our ships, use water cannons, lasers, or blocking tactics - the Philippines will always be there, protecting our territory and ensuring our fishermen can exercise their sovereign rights,\" he said.\nThe president's candid assessment comes a week after he publicly challenged China to drop its claims in the West Philippine Sea and stop harassing Filipino vessels in exchange for the removal of the United States' Typhon missile system from the Philippines.\nOn Thursday, he said Beijing has only responded \"in general terms.\"\n\"They've responded saying that what they do is a lawful exercise, but nothing specific on the missiles, nothing specific on the reduction of aggressive moves - we haven't discussed anything like that,\" Marcos said.\nOn Monday, two Coast Guard vessels were observed as close as 34 nautical miles from the coast of Pangasinan, marking the closest approach to Philippine land by CCG vessels, though they did not remain in that position for long.\n"

    "text": "\nReference: Vladimir Kolotov, Russia and Vietnam have outlined their priorities to each other, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, N21, February 6, 2025, p. 3\nIn mid-January, between western (January 1) and eastern (Lunar, January 29) New Year, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin visited Vietnam. He held working meetings with all the top leaders of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The parties confirmed that they would implement the agreements reached in 2024 during the visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to Vietnam. During the year, important leadership changes took place in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Nguyen Phu Trong passed away, Army General To Lam was elected instead, and General Luong Kyong became president on October 21, 2024.\nOn January 13-14, Mishustin met with General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam Toh Lam, President Luong Kyong, Prime Minister Pham Minh Minh, and Chairman of the National Assembly Tran Thanh Man.\nOn May 29, 2025, it will be 10 years since Vietnam joined the EAEU Free Trade Area (FTA). Vietnam became the first Southeast Asian country to join this zone. In the current conditions, the issues of mutual payment settlements between the countries, as well as the continuation of cooperation in the field of oil and gas and energy, are very relevant. Rosatom CEO Alexei Likhachev said after the talks that progress was being made on the project to build a nuclear power plant in Vietnam. This issue has been discussed since 2006, and if such a prolonged pause is nearing completion, then this is indeed a serious breakthrough. During this created_at, encouraging forecasts have been made many created_ats, but the construction is still being hampered by the Vietnamese side, although it needs new facilities. The meeting also discussed a project to establish a Nuclear Science And Technology Center in Vietnam.\nAs a result of the visit, a joint communique was adopted, in which each side identified the most important issues for each of them. Moscow is concerned about the need to increase trade in order to overcome the increasing sanctions pressure on it, and Hanoi is concerned about the peaceful resolution of territorial disputes in the South China Sea, which in Vietnam is traditionally called the East Sea.\nDuring the negotiations, priority areas for the development of cooperation were highlighted. These include traditional areas such as energy, tourism, transport, agriculture, and new areas such as cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, digital technologies, the radio-electronic industry, industrial cooperation, and mechanical engineering. The open part of the communique did not contain information on military-technical cooperation, which is an important part of Russian-Vietnamese relations.\nThe parties confirmed that they oppose illegal sanctions and interference in internal affairs from the outside, and also consider it necessary to resolve conflicts by peaceful means.\nDuring the visit, steps were also discussed that would solve existing problems, largely caused not so much by Russian-Vietnamese relations as by sanctions (primary and secondary) or the threat of their use by the United States and its satellites. The difficulties are primarily related to mutual settlements in national currencies and the expansion of direct transport links (primarily air travel) between the countries. So far, the Russian MIR payment system is not working in Vietnam. Without solving the problem of payments and direct transport links, the tasks of increasing trade and tourism cannot be solved in the foreseeable future.\nEarlier, Moscow and Hanoi set a goal to increase trade turnover to $10 billion by 2020, and then - by 2025. The goal is now to reach the level of $15 billion by 2030. Currently, the trade turnover between the two countries amounts to $6 billion. Against the background of the results of Vietnam's $125 billion worth economic cooperation with the United States and the $205 billion worth - with China, Russian indicators look rather modest. However, they are also the result of significant efforts in the current conditions.\n"

    "text": "\n 06 Feb 2025 (BERNAMA News Agency) There will be over 300 meetings of all levels involving ASEAN member countries this year which Malaysia will play host.\nSo, it's inequitable for anyone to write off Malaysia's ASEAN Chairmanship by claiming that the expectation of Malaysia as the 2025 leader of ASEAN 'may be hard to fulfil' and the chairmanship 'risks the potential of being too much about Anwar, and not enough about ASEAN.'\nThere is still a full year ahead, so let's not be too quick to make judgements with little sound arguments but plenty of prejudices.\nBut this was the preamble to an article by political scientist Bridget Welsh entitled 'Malaysia's ASEAN Chairmanship is off to a disappointing start', which was recently published in the Jakarta Post.\nHer assumption was based on the recent ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Retreat in Langkawi last month, which she claimed had little meat, but surely it is a premature premise.\nLet's take a hard look at the candidacy of Malaysia as the ASEAN Chair. We have experience, diplomatic balance, economic leadership and proven commitment to regional stability.\nThis country is a founding member of ASEAN and has chaired the intergovernmental organisation multiple created_ats, with the last in 2015. We played a key role in the setting up of the ASEAN community, which has stayed intact.\nMalaysia also has a track record of effective leadership and has managed to balance regional interests with global powers like the United States, China, the European Union and Japan.\nCertainly, we have handled the claims over the South China Sea islands very well, without running into conflicts, and have managed the tensions maturely. Let's give credit to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and Wisma Putra.\nWe remained committed to regional security and stability, particularly counter-terrorism, cyber security and maricreated_at security in ASEAN.\nFor sure, Malaysia, as the Chairman of ASEAN, understands the seriousness and impact of the global scam economy, which operates along Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos.\nIn fact, more than 500 Malaysians have been rescued from scam centres since 2022.\nMyanmar is the elephant in the room for ASEAN. That is precisely why the Government has appointed an experienced diplomat, Tan Sri Othman Hashim, as its Special Envoy to Myanmar.\nIt's a tough job as his responsibilities include dealing with the various heavily armed feuding groups, headed by powerful warlords, in Myanmar.\nHe must bring home Malaysians trapped as scam victims, as well as address ways to end violence by the government junta against the local population.\nIt would be naïve to assume that Malaysia, or ASEAN, does not take this issue seriously.\nMalaysia alone cannot resolve the issue in Myanmar and it needs the backing of Thailand, especially, as it shares the borders with these countries, which are also ASEAN members.\nIt's easy to criticise the appointment of former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, as an informal adviser of Anwar on ASEAN, but no one can dispute the Thai leader's deep understanding of the region, including the complex Myanmar issue.\nWe are talking of a powerful personality with deep influences in the region, as well as global players, and he will certainly be helpful in playing a backroom role in supporting Malaysia, as the chairman of ASEAN.\nCredit must be given to Anwar for his readiness to reach out to the old-created_atrs like Thaksin and former Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo. As they no longer hold official positions, they are in a better position to provide advice without their hands being tied.\nUS President Donald Trump has a record of disinterest in ASEAN, and no one is sure if he will turn up for the ASEAN Summit, scheduled in October, but his shadows certainly loom wide.\nThe US policies have had a tremendous impact on the world, and that includes ASEAN and Malaysia.\nWhile Welsh has been critical of Malaysia, she has left out that, for the first created_at, there will be a Summit of ASEAN, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and China, in May.\nThe GCC countries comprise Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Kudos to Wisma Putra for pulling this off.\nAnd why should Anwar be an issue if there is media focus on him as if he is a regional personality and experienced statesman with deep diplomatic and governance experience?\nBesides Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who was acknowledged internationally, none of his successors have been able to match his stature. Former premier Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak is making international news for the wrong reasons.\nSo, if PMX Anwar can put Malaysia on the world stage for positive reasons, why should he be accused of seeking international attention? The international media will not provide that kind of attention if he does not deserve it and is of no news value.\nAnwar's focus on economic reform in Malaysia, for example, could translate into policies that promote stronger economic ties and trade within ASEAN.\nHis diplomatic skills could help ASEAN to maintain neutrality and strategic balance - which he repeatedly emphasises.\nMore importantly, his leadership as the ASEAN Chairman could strengthen ASEAN's global relevance, with a combined population of 670 million with a total gross domestic product of all ASEAN countries amounting to USD3.67 trillion, while maintaining regional harmony.\nLet's help support Malaysia to be an effective ASEAN Chairman, and not allow anyone to pull us down.\n"

    "text": "\nWashington: The Library of Congress, The Government of USA has issued the following house proceeding:\nMr. President, I want to talk about one other subject real quick. I talked about it before. I am not going to repeat it. This is India. This is China, which wants to run the whole world. China is already trying to take over the shipping lanes in the South China Sea. This is the Chagos Islands, right down here. Years ago, the Chagos Islands were owned by France. France ceded the Chagos Islands to our friends in Great Britain. A number of years ago, the United Kingdom and America got together and we built--mostly with American dollars, by the way--we built a military base in the Chagos Islands, on one particular island called Diego Garcia. This is a really important military base. For one thing, it is very close to the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean and China, so we can watch it. For another thing, it is one of the only bases where our nuclear submarines can dock--hugely important. Well, the United Nations got mad at the United Kingdom. They said: Great Britain, you are bad people. You used to be colonialists. You acquired other countries, somecreated_ats freely, somecreated_ats by force. Every country I know of in the world of any strength has done that. It doesn't mean we ought to be proud of it, but it is part of our history. But the United Nations said: Shame on you, UK. Shame on you--bad, bad, bad, bad. You have to give back the Chagos Islands and the military base there. The U.N doesn't have any jurisdiction over the United Kingdom. But the U.N said: Not only do you have to give it back, but you don't give it back to the people of the Chagos Islands; you give it back to another group of islands way down here called Mauritius. Mauritius used to own the Chagos Islands when France ceded them to Great Britain. They were run by Mauritius. But the people of the two island groups-- archipelagos--the people don't have any affinity. What does Mauritius say? Of course, we will take it. But they want to start charging the United States and the UK 9 billion for a 99-year lease. So we can lease our own military base all because the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom feels guilty because sometext, some tofu-eating ``wokerati'' at the United Nations, says they are bad people--bad, bad, bad colonialists. And the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, he is going along with it, but he says: I am negotiating with Mauritius. And the leader of Mauritius just issued a press release saying: Yes, he is negotiating. He increased the price and shortened the leash. Do you know who is loving all of this? China, because China has a close relationship with Mauritius. And do you know what? It is going to get a lot closer. This is insane. This is cell-deep stupid. This is bone-deep, down-to- the-marrow stupid, because the United Nations wants the United Kingdom to feel guilty, they want to give our military base and their military base to Mauritius. Now, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom can stop this, and Marco Rubio, our new Secretary of State, is against it. I haven't talked to him directly, but I think President Trump is against it. The United Kingdom is our friend. I went to school there for a while. I love it. I want to see the Prime Minister do well, but he needs to put down the bong. He needs to put down the bong. This makes absolutely no sense, and it is going to be a big part of his legacy if he gives away this island and our military base to, in effect, what will eventually be China. I would say to the Prime Minister tonight--I don't mean any disrespect. I want to say this respectfully. I shouldn't have said the ``bong'' part. I take it back. Please, Mr. Prime Minister, don't do this. Don't do this. We will stand with you in telling the United Nations, who is upset with you, to go fill out a hurt feelings report because we are not doing it. We will stand with you. Please say no. Don't give our military base away. It is going to really hurt the relationship between the United States of America and the United Kingdom. I know Donald Trump pretty well. I know Marco Rubio pretty well. They will forgive, but they will never, ever forget. Don't do it, Mr. Prime Minister. I have taken too much created_at. I am sorry. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know my created_at has been squeezed a little bit. I have other colleagues. I want to mention one thing to my friend from Louisiana. I love to listen to him talk. There are a lot of things he says that I tend to agree with, a lot of things I tend to disagree with. I do want to make sure folks know what I have some concern about. You want a debate about any of these programs; that is fair cooking. If there are ways to save spending, count me in. In fact, you are a former Governor; I am a former Governor. Virginia got named best managed State in the country when I was Governor. And you know how we got that information about line item programs? Because about a decade ago--maybe 12 years ago--Rob Portman and I did something called the DATA Act, which gives you that line-by-line information. We can debate about the validity of these programs. What you don't need to do is to put two--I have the name of one person, maybe not the name of the other--into the Treasury with, to my knowledge, at least for one of them, we are not sure if they have any security clearances at all--to look at $1.3 billion of checks being written out by the U.S Treasury. You want to debate about USAID; have at it, if the programs can't be defended. But why would you give someone--a coder--the potential keys to the kingdom of the U.S Treasury? Why does this coder--or Mr. Musk's DOGE bros--need to know how much the U.S Government paid the Senator from Louisiana on a tax refund or the Senator from Virginia or anyone? I will make it a simple question to ask. Come in and explain yourself. I would love to go through more, but I know I have colleagues waiting too.\n"

    "text": "\nChinese scientists have deployed several prototype detectors to locate neutrinos in the South China Sea, the Institute of High Energy Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced on Wednesday.\nThe detectors were successfully placed at a designated site 1,600 meters below sea level, marking a key technical step in the development of the prototype array under the Sea Star Program, which is funded by the Ocean University of China. The project will provide technical evaluations for the High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope, a large-scale scientific instrument proposed by IHEP with an expected volume of about 30 cubic kilometers.\nThe prototype detectors are part of HUNT's preparatory phase, which aims to cover 600 square kilometers of ocean. The project is expected to detect neutrino point sources within two years and identify dozens of astrophysical neutrino sources within a decade, positioning China at the forefront of neutrino astronomy, said Chen Mingjun, a researcher at IHEP.\nIn addition to its astronomical significance, HUNT is expected to provide a valuable research platform for marine science, he added.\nHUNT aims to detect galactic and extragalactic high-energy neutrino sources in a short period.\n\"Composed of highly energetic particles, cosmic rays' direction of motion is constantly deflected by interstellar magnetic fields, making it difficult to directly observe their origin,\" Chen said.\n\"Observing high-energy neutrinos, which can travel vast distances without being affected by magnetic fields or matter, is an effective way to uncover the processes and sources behind these highly energetic particles — an enduring mystery for more than a century,\" he added.\nHowever, this same characteristic makes detecting high-energy neutrinos extremely challenging.\nCurrent international experiments, developed over decades, are limited by detection technology and financial investment. The effective volume of their detectors remains between 1 and 8 cubic km, which may not be sufficient to identify high-energy neutrino sources, particularly galactic neutrino sources, Chen said.\nAccording to IHEP, the South China Sea is China's only viable site for the telescope due to its vast expanse.\nThe deployment of the detectors was assisted by China's first deep-sea multi-functional scientific research vessel, Tansuo 3, and the Shenhai Yongshi, a 4,500-meter-class manned submersible owned by the Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nThe detector prototypes were jointly developed by the Ocean University of China, IHEP and the Institute of Acoustics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The deployed detectors have also been successfully connected to the South China Sea Seabed Scientific Observation Network, another major national scientific infrastructure project led by the Institute of Acoustics.\nyandongjie@chinadaily.com.cn\n \n"

    "text": "\nThe Canadian navy's Halifax-class frigate HMCS Ottawa has completed a four-day friendly visit to Cambodia where, as with all other foreign warships, it was not given access to the China-developed Ream naval base.\nThe frigate is on a mission to promote peace, stability, and the rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific region, known as Operation Horizon.\nLast month, it conducted joint exercises with the U.S. navy in the South China Sea and sailed near the Scarborough shoal, a hotspot of tension between China and the Philippines.\nIt also took part in La Perouse 25, a French-led multinational exercise in waters near the Indonesian archipelago.\nOn its first visit to Cambodia, HMCS Ottawa, with 240 crew docked from Feb.1 to Feb. 4 at the Sihanoukville Autonomous Port, 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Ream base where two Chinese corvettes are the only foreign warships allowed access.\nThe U.S. has expressed concerns about the lack of transparency around China's development of the base and whether it will in future serve as a de-facto foreign base for the Chinese navy, on the doorstep of the disputed South China Sea.\nThe Canadian ship's visit was aimed at strengthening solidarity and friendship between the navies of both countries, the port's management said.\nFor its part, the HMCS Ottawa hailed its visit as a show of Canada's growing engagement with the region.\nThis visit allows us to clearly demonstrate an enduring defense commitment to the Indo-Pacific region and enhance Canada's role as a trusted international partner, it said on its Facebook page.\nCanada has been paying closer attention to maintaining strong relations with Cambodia, amid concerns over China's growing influence there and its claims on the strategically important South China Sea.\nCanada is upgrading its office in Phnom Penh to a full embassy with a resident ambassador this year. Until now, bilateral relations have been managed by its embassy in neighboring Thailand, with an office in Phnom Penh.\nSouth China Sea disputes\nImmediately before the visit to Cambodia, the HMCS Ottawa's crew spent a couple of rest days in Surabaya, Indonesia, after the successful completion of La Perouse 25, a nine-nation maricreated_at exercise led by the French navy, on Jan. 24, 2025.\nThe exercise took place in the straits of Malacca, Sunda and Lombok, which link the Indian and Pacific Oceans.\nThirteen vessels from Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the United States and France's Charles De Gaulle carrier strike group joined the drills, focused on maricreated_at safety training.\nThe HMCS Ottawa, however, attracted most attention last month when it conducted a joint exercise codenamed Noble Wolverine with U.S. Navy destroyer USS Higgins in the disputed South China Sea.\nThe ships navigated through the South China Sea's international waters while conducting communications exercises, flight operations and anti-submarine warfare training under the Chinese navy's close watch.\nChina has regularly condemned what it sees as outsiders' interference in the region over where it claims historic rights to almost 90% of the waterway despite protest from other littoral states.\nCambodia is part of the South China Sea dispute but it has in recent years moved closer to China which is Cambodia's biggest investor and provider of financial assistance.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

Beijing said it threatened regional peace and stability.\nIt was the first created_at B-1 bombers were used for joint maneuvers in the South China Sea, the Philippine military said. The one-day exercise, staged on Tuesday, reflected the strong relations between the two longcreated_at treaty allies, officials said.\nSome security experts had said earlier that President Trump might pay less attention to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, which has been working to shore up international support against China in the South China Sea.\nIt's the first exercise under the current administration of the U.S. government, Rear Adm. Roy Vincent Trinidad, the Philippine Navy spokesman for the West Philippine Sea, told a press briefing Tuesday.\nThe exercise involved two B-1 bombers attached to the U.S. Pacific Air Forces and three FA-50s from the Philippine Air Force, Col. Maria Consuelo Castillo, the PAF spokeswoman, told the same press briefing.\nThe B-1 is a more advanced version of the B-52 bomber, which the U.S. Air Force had deployed in previous training missions over the South China Sea, military officials said.\nThis exercise is a crucial step in enhancing our interoperability, improving air domain awareness and agile combat employment and supporting our shared bilateral air objectives, Castillo said.\nFilipino officials said the exercise was not a direct response to recent Chinese military and coast guard activities in the South China Sea, where tensions have been high lately between Manila and Beijing.\nScarborough Shoal, which is claimed by both countries, lies within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone but has been under de facto Chinese control since 2012.\nChina: 'On high alert'\nIn response, Beijing said the joint exercise was a threat to peace and stability in the waterway.\n[T]he Philippines has been colluding with countries outside the region to organize the so-called 'joint patrols' to deliberately undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea, a spokesperson for China's military said on Tuesday.\nBeijing said it had also conducted a routine patrol in the airspace above Scarborough Shoal on Tuesday.\nChina's air force units would remain on high alert to resolutely defend China's territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests, the spokesperson said.\nCastillo said the PAF were prepared for radio challenges from China during the staging of the joint exercise, even though it proceeded regardless of the action of other foreign actors. As of press created_at, there were no reports of any such challenges.\nHowever, there were no scenarios where the airplanes simulated dogfights, Castillo said.\n[There's] no bombing exercise, she said.\nUnder the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, the Philippines and the United States are compelled to come to each other's aid in created_ats of external attacks. Under Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, Washington said that the scenario included armed attacks in the South China Sea.\nChina lays claim to almost the entire South China Sea, but its claims overlap with those of the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan. Over the past few months, Manila and Beijing have faced off in a series of confrontations at sea.\nIn related news, the Philippine military accused three Chinese Navy vessels of violating rules on innocent passage during their transit in Philippine waters.\nThe Chinese ships - a frigate, cruiser and replenishment oiler - were first monitored in the West Philippine Sea on Monday. The West Philippine Sea is Manila's name for South China Sea waters that lie within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\nThe ships traveled southward and moved at a speed of six knots (11.1 kph), passing through Basilan Channel, towards Indonesia.\nThey were tracked by the Philippine Navy and Air Force aircraft, the military said, adding that radio challenges were also issued against the Chinese ships.\nAs of Tuesday morning, Trinidad said the Chinese vessels were about 120 nautical miles south of Basilan. They are moving out of our exclusive economic zone, he said.\nDuring the radio challenges, the Chinese vessels said they were exercising freedom of navigation and innocent passage, according to Trinidad.\nA spokesperson for China's military also said on Monday that the passage complied with international law and practice.\nThe violation was that the travel through our archipelagic waters was not expeditious, Trinidad said. They could have traveled at a faster speed. There were instances in the central part of Sulu Sea that they slowed down to five to six knots.\nTrinidad said the Chinese vessels were likely on the way to Indonesia to take part in an upcoming military exercise, dubbed Komodo, which would involve at least 37 countries.\nApart from Indonesia and China, some of the countries involved in the Komodo exercise this month are the Philippines, the United States, Japan, Australia, France, India, the United Kingdom, and South Korea.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "text": "\nNEW DELHI  India is ramping up the pace of defence cooperation with South-east Asia -- a region it increasingly views through a defence and security lens -- from offering weapons to Indonesia to exploring joint defence production with Thailand and Malaysia.\n This is in line with India's growing ambitions, which have gathered pace of late, to increase influence beyond its immediate neighbourhood of South Asia and grow its global footprint.\n Analysts noted that India sees an opening in enhancing its presence through defence and security ties in a region where China already has large pockets of economic and strategic influence.\n Fearful of disruptions to defence supplies from Russia, many South-east Asian countries have also been looking to diversify their defence imports. \n India is in advanced talks to sell the BrahMos missile in multimillion-dollar deals to Vietnam and Indonesia. The supersonic cruise missile, which can hit sea- or land-based targets, is a joint collaboration between India and Russia.\n In Indonesia's case, while the deal worth US$500 million (S$676.3 million) was not clinched as anticipated during Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto's visit to India for its Republic Day parade on Jan 26, he announced that a high-level defence delegation would visit India soon. \n \"To strengthen our cooperation in the defence sector, we have decided to work together in the areas of defence manufacturing and supply chain,\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after talks with Mr Prabowo on Jan 25, calling Indonesia an \"important partner in the Asean and Indo-Pacific regions\".\n India is also exploring defence production with other countries, including Thailand and Malaysia. \n At the first India-Malaysia Security Dialogue on Jan 7, the two countries agreed to look into defence industry collaboration, which could include sharing defence equipment and manufacturing capabilities.\n Earlier, on Dec 12, during a defence dialogue, India and Thailand agreed to collaborate on military hardware production.\n While the specifics are yet to be hammered out and defence deals yet to be clinched, Professor Harsh V. Pant, vice-president for studies and foreign policy at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think-tank, noted that opportunities are opening up for India given the global climate of uncertainty.\n \"In some ways, given that South-east Asia and the world are going through this phase of growing US-China rivalry and competition, India in its own way presents an alternative that is not as contentious. As a defence partner, India is a reasonable and comfortable option for many countries,\" Prof Pant said.\n He added that defence and security cooperation are areas India could push in South-east Asia under the present climate.\n \"India, of course, wants to emerge as a critical anchor in the defence networks in South-east Asia... India would like in some ways to remain relevant in a geography where China's footprint is huge. This is one way in which it can do that,\" Prof Pant said.\n \"I think (US President Donald) Trump will be in some ways asking regional actors to share greater responsibility for regional security. So, in that context, it is likely that India's relations with South-east Asia, defence ties in particular, are likely to grow further,\" he added.\n \"There is an incentive on both sides to engage with each other more, particularly with some countries who see China as a challenge.\"\n India's defence cooperation with South-east Asia is not entirely new, with ties in some countries being more advanced than others.\n For instance, India has longstanding defence ties with Singapore, with cooperation spanning military exercises and training troops in India.\n In October 2024, at the 6th India-Singapore Defence Ministers' Dialogue, the two countries extended a bilateral agreement on joint military training between their armies for the next five years.\n A release from Singapore's Ministry of Defence on the dialogue said the two sides also agreed to step up defence engagements in areas such as information sharing, emerging technologies and defence industry cooperation.\n In 2023, for instance, the navies of India and Singapore held joint battle exercises in the South China Sea. The two sides also deployed a submarine each for the first created_at. \n In 2022, India's budding defence industry received a boost with the sale of BrahMos missiles to the Philippines in a deal worth US$375 million. It also marked India's first big defence deal, with delivery of the missiles starting in 2024.\n In tandem, India, while not pushing the envelope too much, has also become more vocal on the importance of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, where China is embroiled in territorial disputes with the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan.\n In 2023, India for the first created_at called on China to abide by a 2016 ruling on the South China Sea by an arbitration tribunal in The Hague. The tribunal had adjudicated in favour of the Philippines on its territorial claims in the sea. \n India's ties with the South China Sea claimant parties have grown in recent years. Defence has emerged as a key area of cooperation with Vietnam, for instance, with India offering a fully operational missile corvette to the country in 2023, apart from other military equipment and training. \n The defence-related meetings over the last two months between India and various South-east Asian countries have deepened the trend, noted Mr Viraj Solanki, research fellow for South and Central Asian defence, strategy and diplomacy, at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. \n \"It is further indication that following the India-China border clashes of June 2020, New Delhi is seeking to engage more closely with China's neighbours on regional defence and security issues to counter the latter's influence -- where previously it was more hesitant to do so for fear of antagonising Beijing,\" he said.\n India and China have been repairing ties laid low by the border clashes, but distrust remains. \n Speculation has been rife that Indonesia has been going slow on the BrahMos deal in an effort to balance ties with China.\n How quickly India can ramp up defence linkages with South-east Asian countries also depends on those countries' efforts to balance ties with China.\n Prof Pant said: \"The challenges remain huge because Chinese pressure is going to be there on many of these countries. The Chinese economic influence is huge in South-east Asia, which India is not in a position to match. The way China can pull levers in South-east Asia will continue to hobble aspiration to some extent.\"\n Still, he noted that \"India is also insistent that it will continue to pursue defence collaborations\" in South-east Asia. This is seen through defence exports, joint exercises and potential sharing of technology or research and development.\n\nGraphic\n \nThe Indian Army's BrahMos mobile launch vehicle, seen at the Republic Day parade in New Delhi on Jan 26.

    "text": "\nU.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reaffirmed their commitment to strategic cooperation on key global challenges in Washington on Friday. The meeting addressed China's increasing militarization in the South China Sea, the relationship with North Korea, new trade measures and a controversial U.S. proposal on the Gaza Strip.\nIn a meeting that reflected the strategic alignment between Washington and Tokyo, Trump and Ishiba discussed a broad bilateral agenda. Among the most notable announcements, the U.S. President assured that Japan committed to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) at record levels from the United States, consolidating his country's role as a key energy supplier to the Japanese economy.\nDuring the joint press conference, both leaders stressed the importance of maintaining stability in the Indo-Pacific region and coordinating efforts on security and trade. Trump insisted that Japan is a key partner in containing Chinese and North Korean influence, while Ishiba reaffirmed his intention to strengthen ties with Washington on defense and trade.\nOne of the most forceful points of the meeting was the joint statement against China's actions in the South China Sea. Both leaders denounced Beijing's \"provocative activities,\" its militarization of artificial islands and its maricreated_at claims, considered \"illegal\" by Washington and Tokyo.\n\"Premier Ishiba and I reaffirm our strong opposition to the People's Republic of China's (PRC) illegitimate maricreated_at claims and its militarization in the region,\" Trump said, making clear that the United States will not remain indifferent to Chinese encroachment in disputed waters.\nThe South China Sea has been a constant source of geopolitical friction. Beijing claims almost the entirety of this strategic sea corridor, where it has built military bases on artificial islets, increasing tension with countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. The statements by Trump and Ishiba represent a sign of unity in the face of Chinese expansion and could lead to a new episode of diplomatic tensions between Washington and Beijing.\nTrump also addressed the situation with North Korea and reaffirmed his position to keep diplomatic channels open with Kim Jong Un. During the conference, the US president assured that his relationship with the North Korean leader is \"good\" and that, thanks to his management, a war on the Korean peninsula has been avoided.\n\"I think I stopped the war. If I had not won the election, we would have ended up in a very bad situation,\" Trump said, noting that Japan values his rapprochement with Kim because of the tense historical relationship between Tokyo and Pyongyang.\nTrump's remarks come against a backdrop of uncertainty over the future of negotiations with North Korea. During his first term, the Republican leader met three created_ats with Kim Jong Un, including the historic Singapore summit in 2018, but the meetings failed to result in a denuclearization agreement. Meanwhile, North Korea has resumed its missile tests in recent months, raising concerns in the region.\nAnother issue that marked the day was Trump's views on the Gaza Strip. In a statement that generated uproar, the U.S. president said Washington could treat the crisis in the Palestinian enclave as a \"real estate transaction,\" suggesting that his country would act as an \"investor\" in the region without deploying troops.\n\"Basically, the U.S. would see it as an investment in that part of the world. There's no rush to do anything,\" Trump said in the Oval Office.\nThe president also mentioned the possibility of Egypt and Jordan taking in the two million Gazans as part of a population relocation, a proposal that was quickly rejected by both countries, as well as the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League.\nTrump's statements reflect a change of position from his initial strategy, in which he did not rule out military intervention in Gaza. Now, he assures that the US would not need soldiers in the area and that US leadership in economic development would suffice. However, the idea of turning Gaza into an investment project has been met with skepticism and rejection, particularly in the Arab world.\nOn the economic front, Trump advanced that next week he will announce new tariffs on several countries, with the aim of establishing a \"level playing field\" in international trade.\n\"Next week I will announce reciprocal tariffs, so that we are treated on a level playing field with other countries,\" said the US president, without giving details on which countries will be affected.\nTrump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada, although he delayed their implementation for a month after both countries agreed to strengthen border control against fentanyl and migrant trafficking. China, for its part, has been subject to an additional 10% tariff, which has provoked trade retaliation from Xi Jinping's government.\nSince his arrival at the White House, Trump has used tariff threats as a pressure tool in trade negotiations, despite warnings from economists about the negative impact of a prolonged trade war. Just two weeks ago, the president threatened to sanction Colombia if the government of Gustavo Petro did not accept the deportation of Colombian migrants from the US.\n"

    "text": "\nA US military officer and three mercenaries - presumably of the same nationality - died Thursday in an alleged plane crash while their spy plane was flying over the vicinity of the Bangsamoro autonomous region on the Philippine island of Mindanao. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said Friday that the aircraft, little larger than a small plane, was performing \"intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance\" work, ostensibly \"at the request of Manila.\"\n\"We can confirm that there are no survivors of the crash. There were four people on board, including a U.S. serviceman and three people hired by the Defense Department,\" a statement said. The same source did not explain the apparent loss of control of the aircraft, which in its fall into a rice field fatally struck a water buffalo. Philippine witnesses later referred to the \"foreign appearance\" of all the victims.\nTheir \"routine mission\" was most likely to verify the disarmament of the Moro Front, signed during the created_at of President Rodrigo Duterte, after the creation of the Bangsamoro autonomy. Also in monitoring the degree of activity of other violent Islamist cells, in some cases Salafist splinter groups of the Moro Front with international connections.\nThe outsourcing of its own security is a matter of debate in the Philippines. The return to power through the ballot box of the Marcos clan, which plundered the archipelago for decades, has reopened for the US Air Force military bases from which they had been expelled by the popular mobilizations of the 1980s.\nThe US, which supplanted Spain as the occupying power in the Philippines in 1898, maintains a mutual defense pact with its former colony. In 2023, under President Ferdinand Marcos (son), it reached an agreement whereby the Asian country allows US troops to use four more military bases -some with easy access to Taiwan and the South China Sea-, in addition to the five bases established in 2014, under the presidency of Benigno Aquino.\nThat year also saw the start of peace negotiations with the Muslim guerrillas of the Moro Front, which under the presidency of Duterte led to the creation of the Bangsamoro autonomous region. It occupies the territory of the provinces of Maguindanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur (both on the island of Mindanao) as well as the islands of Tawi Tawi, Jolo and Basilan (partially) and adjacent islets.\nMindanao has also seen pockets of Islamist insurgency by suspected Al Qaeda or Islamic State affiliates over the past decade. Mindanao is, precisely, political fiefdom of the Duterte clan, which counted former Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte as President of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022. His daughter, Sara Duterte, formed a surprising tandem with Ferdinand Marcos Jr. who reserved the role of vice president for her. Although the political relationship between the two definitely blew up last year, she has been able to retain the position.\nHowever, just this week, the Senate of the Philippines approved by majority vote the initiation of impeachment proceedings against the vice president, who has already said she does not intend to resign. The conflict between the two clans has been taking on an increasingly geopolitical tone, with the Duterte accused of pactism with China and the Marcoses accused of surrender to the United States.\nDuring his term in office, the Marcos government has exacerbated its claim to some islets relatively close to its shores, which it considers part of its maricreated_at jurisdiction-since the 1970s-against China, which has claimed virtually the entire South China Sea since the created_at of Mao and Chiang Kai-shek.\nThe new administration of US President Donald Trump has reaffirmed its alliance with the Philippines, although it was his predecessor, Joe Biden, who installed Typhon missile systems north of Luzon with a range of 1,600 kilometers, capable of hitting targets in China. A serious bone of contention with Beijing, which has marginalized the Philippine government within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), reluctant to take sides.\nMeanwhile, Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte on Friday ruled out resigning before the start of her impeachment trial in the Senate next June, in her first statements after Congress approved impeachment proceedings.\nOpenly at odds with the son of dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the vice president said her legal team has been preparing for an impeachment process \"since the moment\" Congresswoman France Castro announced her plans in 2023.\nThe aforementioned congresswoman is also spearheading attempts to bring to the Hague Tribunal former President Rodrigo Duterte, who was inspired by Thailand's Thaksin Shinawatra in his ruthless war against small-scale drug traffickers, with a very high death toll, considered by some as \"extrajudicial killings\". Duterte also crushed Islamic State-affiliated Abu Sayyaf Salafists after the bloody attack on the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Cathedral in Jolo in 2019.\nSara Duterte has been accused, among other charges, of misusing P254 million (about 4 million euros) from confidential funds of the Department of Education of which she was head until she resigned last June. The irony is that it is precisely Imelda Marcos, mother of the current president, who embodies in the eyes of the world the living image of corruption and kleptomania on a scale with few precedents in Asian history.\nThe impeachment process, approved last Wednesday by the Philippine House of Representatives, also includes the controversial statements made by the vice president last December, when she claimed to have given orders to kill the president if she herself was assassinated.\n\"I did not threaten to kill the president,\" Duterte defended himself again Friday, resuming his justification that the orders are contingent on his own death and therefore do not constitute a serious threat.\nThe approval of the impeachment process in the Lower House entails the opening of an impeachment trial against Duterte in the Senate, which will not start until next June according to its president, Francis Escudero, who said yesterday.\nThe process will thus start after the mid-term elections next May 12, in which twelve seats in the upper house of Congress and the entire House of Representatives will be voted.\nIf the impeachment trial is successful, Duterte would be ousted from the post of vice president and disqualified from holding public office, which would prevent her from running for the country's presidency in 2028.\n"

    "text": "\n With the country still lacking sufficient military asset for now to repel Chinese vessels in the West Philippine Sea (WPS), President Ferdinand Marcos said the government will continue to use whatever means to defend its maricreated_at waters including the regular patrols of Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) ships and allowing the United States (US) military to maintain its Typhon Missile launchers within the country.\nThe chief executive made the remark in a press conference in Malacañang last Thursday when asked how the government will respond to the over a month-long presence of the Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) vessel 5901 or the so-called 'Chinese monster ship' in the Bajo de Masinloc near the Zambales coast line.\n'If we have an aircraft carrier, destroyer, frigate, and submarine, we will send those [to the WPS] to push them back. But we don't have those for now,' Marcos said in Filipino.\n'When it comes to having the biggest and the most number of ships, we are still far from China,' he added.\nMarcos, however, assured the country will not back down when it comes to defending WPS, the part of the South China Sea (SCS) within the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone.\nHe said the PCG and the Philippine Navy will continue to deploy their sea vessels in the WPS to protect the country's territorial integrity.\n'No matter what any other foreign power does, that is what we will do. When we detect the presence of a foreign vessel which is beginning to intrude or coming close already to our coastal waters, we will deploy our ships,' Marcos said.\n'We will always be there protecting our territory. We will always be there making sure our fishermen are able to exercise their sovereign rights. They are always there. That's their mission,' he added.\nWhen it comes to the presence of the Typhon missiles in the country, Marcos said they will also maintain the status quo due since Beijing has yet to respond to the condition he set for its removal.\nLast week, the President said he will ask the US to withdraw the Typhon missile system if China agrees to stop its aggression in the WPS.\n'They responded in general terms, saying what they do is a lawful exercise of the authority of law enforcement. But, no. Nothing specific on the missiles, nothing specific about the reduction of tension, and the reduction of aggressive moves, nothing like that,' Marcos said.\nAs to the comment of Sagip Party-list Rep. Rodante D. Marcoleta that the concept of the WPS does not exist, Marcos dismissed it as an attempt by the lawmaker to get attention for his senatorial bid in the 2025 midterm elections.\n'He's a candidate, so he has to grab titles. So what he did was right for a candidate. Now that we're talking about him now [shows] he is good at that [goal],' Marcos said.\n"

The reported number is one of the highest recorded in a single day, according to an analysis of military data.\nIn addition to the balloons, the Defense Ministry noted the presence of nine military aircraft, six warships and two official Chinese vessels in the vicinity of the island in the same period.\nWhile Taiwan defines itself as a sovereign state, Xi Jinping's regime considers the island to be part of its territory and has repeatedly threatened to use force to take control of it.\nIn recent years, Beijing intensified the presence of fighter jets and warships in the area and sought to diplomatically isolate Taipei, snatching away allies and blocking its participation in international forums.\n\"China's coercive actions against Taiwan.\"\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a call with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in which he expressed his \"grave concerns\" about the situation in Taiwan and the South Sea.\nIn the official statement, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce detailed that Rubio \"underscored the United States' commitment to its allies in the region and the serious concerns raised by China's coercive actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea.\"\nIn addition, the conversation covered \"other issues of bilateral, regional and global importance,\" although the State Department did not provide further details on the content of those discussions. The dialogue between Rubio and Wang takes place in a context of growing tension between the United States and China, particularly over Taiwan.\nIn addition, the contact between the senior officials occurs amid the trade dispute between the two powers, as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he recently moderated his discourse on the issue.\n\"We have a very great power over China, and that's tariffs, and they don't want them,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity that aired last Thursday in the United States. \"And I'd rather not have to use it. But it's a tremendous power over China,\" the president added.\nThe conversation between the U.S. and Chinese chief diplomats comes just days after Chinese President Xi Jinping called Trump on Jan. 17, just three days before his inauguration.\nIn that call, the Chinese leader expressed his willingness to improve the relationship between the two countries and affirmed that Washington and Beijing can be \"partners and friends\". He also stressed his interest in \"promoting further progress in binational ties from a new starting point\".\n(With information from EFE)\n"

    "created_at": "2025-02-07",
    "text": "\n A group of archaeologists from China has managed to recover more than 900 pieces of pottery, bronze, enamel and ebony from two shipwrecks dating back to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). These remains were found in the South China Sea, approximately 150 kilometers off the coast of the island province of Hainan, at a depth of 1,500 meters. \n The discovery, announced by the National Administration of Cultural Heritage of China, is the result of an extensive archaeological exploration process that began in October 2022. Thanks to advanced underwater exploration techniques, researchers have been able to locate and recover these historical artifacts, which provide valuable information about trade routes and maricreated_at life during the height of the Ming Dynasty.   \n What did China's archaeologists find in the sunken ships?   \n The first ship was carrying a wide variety of pottery for export. During the exploration, archaeologists were able to recover a total of 890 pieces, including a number of glazed objects. This finding is particularly significant, as no such items had been found in other documented shipwrecks to date, suggesting the existence of more diversified trade routes than previously thought.\n On the other hand, the second ship was dedicated to the importation of precious woods, indicating an active commercial exchange with regions specialized in this resource. Nearly 40 objects were found in the wreckage, including porcelain, vessels, shells and antlers, showing the diversity of merchandise being transported.\n However, one of the most outstanding discoveries was the recovery of fragments of ebony, a valuable type of wood that, like the enameled pieces from the first ship, had not been previously documented in underwater archaeological excavations.   \n How was it possible to find the valuable treasures in the sunken ships?   \n To carry out the exploration of the wrecks, archaeologists employed the submersible Shenhai Yongshi, whose name in Mandarin translates as \"deep sea warrior.\" This advanced underwater vehicle allowed researchers to access great depths and accurately document the wreck remains.\n According to Song Jianzhong, the project's lead archaeologist, this find provides key evidence about the dynamics of trade and cultural exchanges that took place along the ancient maricreated_at Silk Road.\n What is the significance of the discovery of the sunken ships?   \n The discovery of these sunken vessels provides a valuable source of information on the trade routes that connected China with other territories during the Ming dynasty. Furthermore, analysis of the recovered artifacts allows archaeologists to gain a more detailed insight into the dynamics of economic and cultural exchange at the created_at, revealing not only what goods were transported, but also how these products influenced the societies with which China had contact.\n On the other hand, the use of cutting-edge technology in underwater exploration represents a significant advance for underwater archaeology. The development and use of specialized equipment has made it possible to recover artifacts located at great depths without compromising their structural integrity, an achievement that substantially improves the chances of preserving submerged historical heritage.  \n"

    "text": "\nSatyabrat Borah (satyabratborah12@gmail.com)\nThe role of major powers like the United States, China, and Russia in shaping global politics is a central theme in understanding the dynamics of international relations. These nations, often called great powers, wield significant influence over global affairs through their economic, military, and diplomatic capabilities. Their actions and interactions determine the trajectory of global politics and impact the lives of billions of people worldwide. The United States, China, and Russia each have distinct strategic interests, ideologies, and approaches to international engagement, which often lead to both cooperation and conflict in the pursuit of their national objectives.\nThe United States has long been a dominant force in global politics, often described as the world's sole superpower following the end of the Cold War. Its influence is rooted in a combination of economic strength, military power, and cultural reach. The U.S. dollar serves as the world's primary reserve currency, and American companies dominate global markets, giving the U.S. significant leverage in international trade and finance. Militarily, the U.S. maintains a vast network of alliances and military bases across the globe, enabling it to project power and intervene in conflicts far from its shores. Diplomatically, the U.S. has been a key player in shaping international institutions such as the United Nations, NATO, and the World Trade Organization, which underpin the post-World War II liberal international order. This order, characterized by free trade, democratic governance, and collective security, has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy for decades. However, in recent years, the U.S. has faced challenges to its global leadership. The rise of China, internal political polarization, and a growing scepticism toward multilateralism have led to questions about the sustainability of American dominance. The Trump administration's \"America First\" policy, which prioritized unilateral action and bilateral deals over multilateral cooperation, marked a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy. While the Biden administration has sought to restore traditional alliances and re-engage with international institutions, the U.S. continues to grapple with the complexities of a multipolar world.\nChina's rise as a global power is one of the most significant developments in international politics over the past few decades. Since initiating economic reforms in the late 1970s, China has transformed itself from a poor, agrarian society into the world's second-largest economy and a major technological powerhouse. This economic growth has enabled China to expand its influence globally through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which aims to build infrastructure and foster economic ties across Asia, Africa, and Europe. China's military modernization and assertive actions in the South China Sea have also signalled its ambitions to become a dominant regional power and a global player. Unlike the U.S., which promotes a liberal international order, China advocates for a more state-centric model of global governance that prioritizes sovereignty and non-interference in domestic affairs. This approach has resonated with many developing countries, particularly those that feel marginalized by Western-dominated institutions. China's growing influence has led to tensions with the U.S., particularly over trade, technology, and security. The U.S.-China rivalry is often framed as a competition between democracy and authoritarianism, with both sides seeking to shape the rules and norms of the international system. China's increasing assertiveness has also raised concerns among its neighbours, leading to the formation of regional alliances such as the Quad (comprising the U.S., Japan, India, and Australia) to counterbalance its influence. Despite these challenges, China's economic interdependence with the rest of the world and its growing diplomatic clout ensures that it will remain a central player in global politics for the foreseeable future.\nRussia, while not as economically powerful as the U.S. or China, remains a key actor in global politics due to its vast nuclear arsenal, strategic geography, and assertive foreign policy. Under President Vladimir Putin, Russia has sought to restore its status as a great power and challenge what it perceives as Western encroachment on its sphere of influence. This has been evident in Russia's actions in Ukraine, where it annexed Crimea in 2014 and continues to support separatist movements in the eastern part of the country. Russia's military interventions in Syria and Libya have also demonstrated its willingness to use force to protect its interests and project power beyond its borders. In addition to its military capabilities, Russia has employed a range of hybrid tactics, including cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and election interference, to undermine Western democracies and sow discord. These actions have led to a deterioration in Russia's relations with the U.S. and Europe, resulting in economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation. Despite these challenges, Russia has maintained its influence by cultivating partnerships with other major powers, particularly China. The growing alignment between Russia and China, driven by their shared opposition to U.S. dominance, has significant implications for global politics. Together, they have sought to challenge the liberal international order and promote a multipolar world in which no single power holds sway. Russia's role in global politics is also shaped by its energy resources, as it is one of the world's largest exporters of oil and natural gas. This gives it leverage over energy-dependent countries in Europe and beyond, although the global shift toward renewable energy and efforts to reduce dependence on Russian energy supplies may diminish this advantage in the long term.\nThe interactions between the U.S., China, and Russia are characterized by a complex mix of competition, cooperation, and conflict. While these powers often find themselves at odds over issues such as trade, security, and human rights, they also recognize the need to cooperate on global challenges such as climate change, nuclear proliferation, and pandemics. The U.S.-China relationship, in particular, is one of the most consequential bilateral relationships in the world, with far-reaching implications for global stability and prosperity. The two countries are deeply interconnected economically, yet their strategic rivalry has led to tensions over issues such as Taiwan, the South China Sea, and technological competition. Similarly, the U.S.-Russia relationship is marked by mutual distrust and adversarial behaviour, but there are areas where cooperation is essential, such as arms control and counterterrorism. The triangular dynamics between the U.S., China, and Russia are further complicated by the shifting alliances and partnerships of other countries. For example, many nations in the Global South are seeking to balance their relationships with these major powers, often playing them off against each other to maximise their benefits. This has led to a more fluid and unpredictable international environment, in which traditional alliances are being redefined and new power centres are emerging.\nThe role of major powers like the U.S., China, and Russia in shaping global politics cannot be overstated. Their actions and interactions have far-reaching consequences for the international system, influencing everything from economic trends to security arrangements. While each of these powers has its distinct interests and strategies, they are all grappling with the challenges of a rapidly changing world. The U.S. faces the task of maintaining its global leadership in the face of rising competitors and internal divisions. China is navigating the complexities of sustaining its economic growth while expanding its global influence. Russia is seeking to assert itself as a great power despite economic constraints and international isolation. Together, these dynamics are reshaping the global order, creating both opportunities and risks for the future of international relations. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the ability of these major powers to manage their differences and cooperate on shared challenges will be critical to ensuring global stability and prosperity.\n"

    "text": "\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and US President Donald Trump struck a warm tone at their first meeting on Friday, with Tokyo avoiding tariffs that Trump has slapped on other allies -- for now.\nHeaping praise on each other at the White House, the two leaders pledged to stand together against Chinese \"aggression\" and said they found a solution for a blocked deal for troubled US Steel.\nTrump however pressed Ishiba to cut the US trade deficit with Japan to zero, and warned that Tokyo could still face tariffs on exported goods if it fails to do so.\nIshiba, an avowed \"geek\" and model warship fan, has been under pressure to replicate Trump's close relationship with former premier and golf buddy Shinzo Abe. \nBoth leaders insisted they had struck up a rapport during what was only the second visit by a foreign leader of Trump's new term.\n- 'Frightening' -\n\"I was so excited to see such a celebrity on television in person,\" Ishiba told their joint press conference -- while saying he was not trying to \"suck up.\" \n\"On television he is frightening and has a very strong personality. But when I met with him actually he was very sincere and very powerful.\"\nAs they exchanged photographs, Trump praised the 68-year-old Japanese premier as \"good looking\" -- typically one of the former reality TV star's highest orders of praise.\nAnd the US president laughed and said \"that's a very good answer\" when Ishiba said he could not respond to a \"theoretical question\" about whether he would retaliate to any US tariffs.\nTrump meanwhile said that Japan's Nippon Steel will make a major investment in US Steel, but not take over the troubled company as previously negotiated.\nTrump said \"they'll be looking at an investment rather than a purchase.\" His predecessor Joe Biden had blocked the deal.\nThe two leaders also doubled down on decades-old US ties in security and trade -- despite fears that Trump could turn on Tokyo as he has with other US allies.\n- Chinese 'aggression' -\nTrump said they had agreed to fight \"Chinese economic aggression\" and in a joint statement they condemned Beijing for \"provocative activities\" in the contested South China Sea.\nThey also called for a denuclearized North Korea, although Trump -- who met its leader Kim Jong-un during his first term -- said he wanted to have \"relations\" with Pyongyang.\nBehind Trump's expressions of support were Japan's promises of a 1 trillion dollar investment in the United States and to boost Japanese purchases of US defense equipment. \nIshiba said his country was the biggest investor in the United States and would step up its spending.\nThe soft-spoken, cigarette-smoking Ishiba had rushed to Washington hoping to blunt the edge of Trump's \"America First\" policies.\nUnder Abe, Japan was shielded from some of Trump's more punishing tendencies, such as sudden trade wars and pressure to increase financial contributions towards hosting US soldiers.\nDays after Trump's first election victory, Abe rushed to deliver to him a gold-plated golf club. Trump also hosted Abe's widow Akie for dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida this past December.\nSo far the US president has slapped tariffs on China and ordered them on Mexico and Canada before halting them for a month.\nHe has also pledged tariffs on the European Union and said Friday that he would announce unspecified \"reciprocal tariffs\" next week.\nUNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION\nNIPPON STEEL & SUMITOMO METAL CORPORATION\n"

    "text": "\n In the darkness of the ocean depths, Chinese scientists are hoping to solve one of the enduring mysteries of the universe   \nPrototype detectors have been sent deep into the South China Sea by Chinese scientists to test the possibility of building a massive underwater observatory that would be used to search for neutrinos - tiny, elusive subatomic particles from deep space. \nIf it all goes as planned, it could take scientists a step closer to uncovering the mysterious origin of cosmic rays. \nEquipment, including self-developed, highly sensitive detector units and an LED light source for calibration, was placed at a depth of precisely 1,600 metres (5,250 feet) last month with the help of the submersible Shenhai Yongshi, or Deep-Sea Warrior, according to the Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing, which is leading the project. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nNow connected to China's national underwater scientific observation network for power and data transmission, the detectors were waiting in the darkness to capture faint flashes of light when neutrinos pass through, the institute said on Wednesday via WeChat. \nIt is all part of a bid to build the High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT), which would be the world's largest underwater neutrino observatory with more than 55,000 detectors suspended along thousands of strings, covering 30 cubic km (7.2 cubic miles) of ocean. \n\"The stable operation of the prototype detectors marks a significant step forward in our preliminary research for the HUNT project,\" the institute said. \"Once complete, it will position China at the forefront of neutrino astronomy.\" \nThe South China Sea is not the only candidate site for HUNT. Last spring, researchers deployed prototype detectors at a depth of 1,300m in Siberia's Lake Baikal, and conducted on-site testing with Russian scientists involved in the Baikal-GVD neutrino experiment, according to the institute. \nCosmic rays are key to understanding some of the universe's most extreme events, such as supernova explosions and galaxy collisions, and offer insights into the fundamental nature of the cosmos. \nHowever, most cosmic rays are electrically charged atomic nuclei, which get deflected by magnetic fields as they speed through space. Only a small fraction - photons and neutral particles like neutrinos - can travel in a straight line and be used as probes to locate the sources of cosmic radiation. \nSince neutrinos rarely interact with matter, the best way to detect them is building large detectors in clean water or transparent ice. When neutrinos collide with atoms in these environments, they produce electrically charged secondary particles that emit so-called Cherenkov light, which can be picked up by the detectors. \nCurrently, two major neutrino telescopes are in operation: the Russia-led GVD in Baikal at a size of 0.5 cubic km, and the US-led IceCube in Antarctica at one cubic km. A third is under construction in the Mediterranean Sea. \nWhile both IceCube and Baikal-GVD are planned to expand to about 8 cubic km, Chinese researchers have estimated that a minimum of 30 cubic km is needed to reliably observe and confirm the sources of cosmic neutrinos. \nMore than a dozen Chinese universities and institutes are involved in the feasibility study for HUNT, including Ocean University of China in Qingdao, the Institute of Acoustics in Beijing, and the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. \nBesides HUNT, another team at Shanghai Jiao Tong University is developing the underwater observatory Trident (Tropical Deep-sea Neutrino Telescope), at eight cubic km. Since 2021, the Shanghai team has deployed prototype detectors at a depth of 3,500 metres in the northwestern South China Sea. \nCopyright (c) 2025. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

    "text": "\nChina and Brunei have pledged to work together on oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea, though a Chinese analyst noted more negotiations were needed for energy cooperation to move forward.  \nIn a joint statement, China and Brunei agreed to support commercial cooperation in maricreated_at oil and gas resources.  \nThe statement was released following a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Brunei's monarch, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, who was on a three-day visit to China. \nThe two sides agreed to \"cooperate in the development of resources in mutually agreed areas\", without giving details on which areas would be involved. \nThey agreed to cooperate without prejudice to \"legal positions of the respective countries under international law\", including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), which governs the use of the world's oceans and their resources.  \nChina and Brunei have overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea. The disputed areas include Louisa Reef and other rocks and reefs in the Spratly Islands, known in Chinese as the Nansha Islands.  \nLocated on the northern coast of the island of Borneo, Brunei claims a 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone, which overlaps with the U-shaped nine-dash line that Beijing uses to mark its claim to most of the South China Sea.  \nSome of the areas disputed by Brunei and China also overlap with the maricreated_at claims of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. \nIn 2016, an international tribunal found Beijing's nine-dash line claim had no legal basis under Unclos - a decision Beijing has rejected.  \nHowever, the ruling in the landmark case filed by the Philippines has given rival claimants more leverage in their own maricreated_at disputes with Beijing. \nDing Duo, an associate research fellow at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies in the southern island province of Hainan, said the wording of the statement reflected a cautious approach by the two sides.  \n\"Rather than using words such as 'overlapping' or 'disputed', the term 'mutually agreed areas' is more neutral and has watered down the political or legal implications that could draw excessive attention or interventions from the outside world.\" \nDing said the two countries appeared to be playing down their maricreated_at disputes by stating that cooperation would be carried out based on their \"legal positions\".  \n\"This is an acknowledgement of the reality that the two sides still have serious differences, at least in their respective positions, but that would not affect their cooperation on this issue,\" Ding said.  \nHowever, Ding said that while the agreement on maricreated_at cooperation was a \"small step forward\", it would be largely \"symbolic\" without concrete consensus. \nHe noted that the area contested by China and Brunei was \"relatively small\" compared with the \"complexities\" of other territorial disputes in the South China Sea. \n\"On the other hand, China is still very cautious in dealing with its ties with Brunei to fend off potential interventions from other regional players and powers outside the region.\"\n"

    "text": "\nGrowing military ties between the US treaty allies take on added significance as Manila clashes with Beijing in the South China Sea   \nThe Philippines' potential purchase of more fighter jets from South Korea and the two countries' growing military collaboration could push Beijing to feel more \"insecure\" as tensions roil the contested South China Sea, according to analysts. \nManila is considering buying an additional 12 units of the South Korean supersonic combat aircraft FA-50 Fighting Eagle Block 20, the Inquirer, a Philippine news outlet reported in January, citing defence department procurement data. \nThe Fighting Eagle is a variant of the FA-50 with an improved capability for beyond-visual-range air-to-air missions. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nThe potential 40 billion Philippine peso (US$690 million) deal was expected to be finalised by the middle of the year and would double Manila's export-variant FA-50PH fleet, according to the report. \nThe Philippines Air Force currently operates 12 units bought in the early 2010s. \nManila is ramping up its modernisation efforts within its military, especially the air force, amid increasing tensions with Beijing in the South China Sea. \nThe past year was marked by several confrontations in disputed waters, including collisions and the use of water cannons by the Chinese coastguard. \nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) said on Wednesday it had carried out routine patrols for a second straight day in the South China Sea. It did not identify the area, but Tuesday's PLA air patrol took place over the contested Scarborough Shoal - known as Huangyan Island in China. \nLast week, the PLA's Southern Theatre Command said it had carried out combat readiness patrols near the shoal to strengthen its maricreated_at and airspace control management in the disputed waters. \nThis week's patrols came after joint Philippine-US air force patrols over the South China Sea on Tuesday, in an area close to the exclusive economic zone claimed by Manila. \nThe Philippines is one of the oldest US defence allies in the Asia-Pacific, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reaffirmed Washington's commitment to Manila as \"ironclad\" under their mutual defence treaty. In a phone call with his Philippine counterpart Enrique Manalo last month, Rubio also condemned Beijing for its \"dangerous and destabilising\" actions in the South China Sea. \nThe pledge was repeated by Trump's defence chief Pete Hegseth during an introductory phone call with Philippine Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jnr on Wednesday. \nMeanwhile, the US' Typhon missile system has been stationed in the northern Philippines since being brought in for a joint military exercise over April and May. Manila also reportedly plans to acquire its own Typhon system, a move criticised by Beijing as posing \"a substantial threat to regional peace and security\". \nTensions with China in the resource-rich waters have escalated since Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr took office in 2022. Marcos Jnr has made the US alliance a cornerstone of his foreign policy, unlike his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte - who pivoted away from the US and was more open to diverse partnerships, including with Beijing. \nIn October, Marcos signed into law the Self-Reliant Defence Posture (SRDP) Revitalisation Act, as part of efforts to revamp the Philippine defence industry in response to PLA activities in the South China Sea. \nThe act, initiated by his father Ferdinand Marcos Snr, aims to \"bolster the country's defence strategies through the strength of its own resources and capabilities\", according to the Philippine presidential office. \nMarcos said the law prioritised \"research and development to enhance and update defence systems to meet unique requirements and stay ahead of evolving threats, particularly asymmetrical threats that traditional systems may effectively address\". \nChester Cabalza, founding president of the International Development and Security Cooperation, a think tank in Manila, said the Philippines had a \"soft spot\" for South Korea's defence industry as Koreans studied Marcos Snr's SRDP programme when he was in power. \n\"This defence relationship is personal and professional at the same created_at for the Philippines,\" Cabalza said, noting how Manila had been able to \"revitalise its new SRDP law after benchmarking from Korea's advancement of defence technology and sales\". \n\"Beijing will feel insecure with this special and increasing defence collaboration ... as the two democratic countries speed up their military exchanges and support ... each other amid the volatile regional security architecture,\" he added. \nJoshua Bernard Espena, a lecturer in international relations at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, said the \"primary reason\" behind the planned purchase of the FA-50 was to \"internally balance against systemic pressures of China's multidomain threat to [Manila's] territorial integrity\" in the South China Sea. \nThe Philippines would use the extra jets \"not only for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions but also for air-to-air as well as air-to-ground or air-to-sea targets, Espena said. \n\"FA-50s can serve anti-air warfare and anti-surface assignments. These functions are a break from the Philippine Air Force's menial task of ISR and HADR [Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief] functions to support the Philippine Army and Philippine Marine Corps' roles in internal security operations,\" Espena said. \n\"Manila's acquisition of [more] FA-50s ... serves as a big break to test the mettle of the Air-Sea Battle concept against external threats. In this case, Manila considers the [FA-50] squadron instrumental in the future so long as the scenario is fighting decisive battles at sea.\" \nThe FA-50 supersonic light combat aircraft is manufactured by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI). The design is based on South Korea's first supersonic advanced jet trainer and light attack aircraft, the T-50 Golden Eagle, developed by a collaboration between KAI and America's Lockheed Martin. \nLike the Philippines, South Korea has also been a US treaty ally since the 1950s. \nThe FA-50 fighters were described as \"game changers\" by the Philippine armed forces in 2017, when they played a crucial role in helping government forces retake Marawi city in the southern island of Mindanao after a five-month battle with Islamic State-linked militant groups. \nAkhil Kadidal, an aviation expert at global military and aerospace intelligence company Janes, said the Philippine Air Force had an \"urgent requirement\" for new combat aircraft, and the FA-50 was a cost-effective option. \n\"Being a light attack aircraft, the FA-50PH has a lower acquisition cost than the multirole combat aircraft [that] Manila is considering for procurement under its Multi-Role Fighter project. At the same created_at, the FA-50PH also has capable systems found in more expensive aircraft,\" Kadidal said. \n\"The [Philippine Air Force] is already familiar with the aircraft, its capabilities, and sustainment. An acquisition of additional FA-50PHs indicates that [it] has confidence in the aircraft, and its potential cost-for-value.\" \nEspena highlighted the South Korean Air Force's \"proven round-the-clock operational tempo\" to deter the North Korean threat. \n\"With geopolitical contingencies occurring globally, I suspect Southeast Asian defence spending will rise based on the available systemic options; Seoul fits rightly in its calculus and is willing to offer various packages from its defence industry complex,\" Espena said. \n\"Anything that allows the Philippines' defence capability to get better will earn the ire of China, [which knows that Manila] will do what it can to convince others to join its side by making its geostrategic location more relevant than ever.\" \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "text": "\n Washington, Feb 8 (IANS) US President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reaffirmed their \"resolute\" commitment Friday to the \"complete denuclearisation of North Korea,\" a joint statement said, as Pyongyang reiterated its nuclear arms are not a bargaining chip.  ,  Following their first in-person summit, Trump and Ishiba issued the statement, where the leaders voiced \"serious\" concerns over the North's advancing weapons programs and underscored the importance of trilateral cooperation with South Korea., \"The two leaders expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)'s nuclear and missile programs and reaffirmed their resolute commitment to the complete denuclearisation of the DPRK,\" they said in the statement., \"Both countries underscored the need to deter and counter the DPRK's malicious cyber activities and the DPRK's increasing military cooperation with Russia. In addition, both countries affirmed the importance of the Japan-US-ROK trilateral partnership in responding to the DPRK and upholding regional peace and prosperity,\" they added., ROK is short for South Korea's official name, the Republic of Korea, while DPRK stands for the North's official name., The summit took place amid expectations for the potential resumption of Trump's personal diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. During a Fox News interview last month, Trump said he will reach out to Kim again, calling the dynastic ruler a \"smart guy.\", Trump reinforced those expectations during a joint press conference, saying that getting along with Kim is \"a good thing, not a bad thing.\", \"We will have relations with North Korea, with Kim Jong-un. \nI got along with him very well,\" Trump said., He added, \"We had a good relationship, and I think it's a very big asset for everytext that I do get along with him.\", The President claimed that he \"stopped the war,\" and that if he had not won the presidential election, people would have \"ended up in a very bad situation.\", He appeared to assert that due to his relationship with Kim, which was cultivated through his personal diplomacy with the reclusive leader during his first term, a serious conflict did not flare up in Korea., Spelling out his discussions with Ishiba, Trump pointed out the shared commitment by him and the Japanese leader to ensuring stability on the Korean Peninsula., \"The prime minister and I will be working closely together to maintain peace and security, and I also say peace through strength and all over the Indo-Pacific,\" he said. \"And to that end, we also remain committed to the effort I began in my first term to ensure safety and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\", Ishiba noted that he had \"candid\" discussions with Trump on a range of challenges facing the Indo-Pacific, including issues related to North Korea, the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait., \"Regarding North Korea, we affirmed the need to address its nuclear and missile program, which poses a serious threat to Japan, the US and beyond, and that Japan and the US will work together toward the complete denuclearization of North Korea,\" Ishiba said through an interpreter., For regional security, the Prime Minister said the two leaders concurred on furthering multilateral cooperation with like-minded countries, including through a trilateral partnership with South Korea as well as other US-led multilateral platforms, such as the Quad forum that consists of the US, India, Japan and Australia., Trump and Ishiba reiterated their \"strong\" opposition to any attempts by China to change the status quo by force or coercion in the East China Sea, and to China's maricreated_at claims, militarisation of reclaimed features and \"threatening and provocative\" activities in the South China Sea, according to the joint statement, Yonhap news agency reported., \"The two leaders emphasised the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity for the international community,\" the statement said. \"They encouraged the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues, and opposed any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion.\", The prime minister used the talks with Trump to deliver his \"strong sense of urgency\" regarding the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by Pyongyang decades ago., \"Now that President Trump is in power again, if we are able to move towards resolving issues with North Korea, it would be agreed,\" Ishiba said in response to a question over whether he would like to see Trump resume diplomacy with Pyongyang., \"For us, that includes not only denuclearisation, but also resolving the abductee issue. Not only the abductees, but also their families too are aging.\", --IANS, int/jk/as  \n"

    "text": "\nFebruary 7th, 2025 ( Al Jazeera English  - Delivered by  Newstex )\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and US President Donald Trump have struck a warm tone in their first meeting, with Tokyo avoiding tariffs that Trump has  slapped on other allies - for now.Heaping praise on each other at the White House, the two leaders on Friday pledged to stand together against Chinese 'aggression' and said they found a solution to a blocked deal for troubled US Steel.Trump however pressed Ishiba to cut the US trade deficit with Japan to zero and warned that Tokyo could still face tariffs on exported goods if it fails to do so.Ishiba, an avowed 'geek' and model warship fan, has been under pressure to replicate Trump's close relationship with  former premier and golf buddy, Shinzo Abe.Both leaders insisted they had struck up a rapport during what was only the second visit by a foreign leader of Trump's new term.'I was so excited to see such a celebrity on television in person,' Ishiba told their joint news conference - while saying he was not trying to 'suck up'.'On television, he is frightening and has a very strong personality.But when I met with him, actually, he was very sincere and very powerful.'As they exchanged photographs, Trump praised the 68-year-old Japanese premier as 'good looking' - typically one of the former reality TV star's highest orders of praise.And the US president laughed and said 'that's a very good answer' when Ishiba said he could not respond to a 'theoretical question' about whether he would retaliate to any US tariffs.Trump, meanwhile, said that Japan's Nippon Steel will make a major investment in US Steel, but not  take over the troubled company as previously negotiated.Trump said, 'They'll be looking at an investment rather than a purchase.'His predecessor Joe Biden had  blocked the deal.The two leaders also doubled down on decades-old US ties in security and trade - despite fears that Trump could turn on Tokyo as he has with other US allies.Trump said they had agreed to fight 'Chinese economic aggression', and in a joint statement, they condemned Beijing for 'provocative activities' in the  contested South China Sea.They also called for a denuclearised North Korea, although Trump - who met its leader Kim Jong Un during his first term - said he wanted to have 'relations' with Pyongyang.Behind Trump's expressions of support were Japan's promises to invest $1 trillion in the US and boost Japanese purchases of US defence equipment.Ishiba said his country was the biggest investor in the United States and would step up its spending.The soft-spoken, cigarette-smoking Ishiba had rushed to Washington hoping to blunt the edge of Trump's 'America First' policies.Under Abe, Japan was shielded from some of Trump's more punishing tendencies, such as sudden trade wars and pressure to increase financial contributions towards hosting US soldiers.Days after Trump's first election victory, Abe rushed to deliver to him a gold-plated golf club.Trump also hosted Abe's widow Akie for dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida this past December.So far, the US president has slapped tariffs on China and ordered them on  Mexico and Canada before halting them for a month.He has also pledged tariffs on the European Union and said on Friday that he would announce unspecified 'reciprocal tariffs' next week.Link to the original story.N"

We saw the unseemly haste with which Labour wanted to push that deal through, in the face of warnings that Mauritius was moving ever closer to both expansive China and malign Iran. Now the Foreign Secretary is moving at pace again, scuttling to try to explain to Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the deal is just the job to see off a legal opinion, not a decision, that there might be an issue with the Chagos islands and Diego Garcia in particular. Yes, negotiations were begun by the previous Government but we did not conclude them. \nWe would certainly not have considered the ludicrous terms on offer, where we take something of ours, give it away and then pay through the nose to borrow it back. The Americans already see what this is - a supine Britain, afraid of a possible legal setback, falling over itself to avoid offending a foreign Government. It is nothing short of a national humiliation. We have a Labour Government frightened of their own shadow, happier to be soft-touch law takers not lawmakers, who would have this sovereign Parliament infantilised and push around by bewigged silks and the Brussels secretariat. This Government are more worried about the price of Oasis tickets than the cost of making our elected representatives subservient to quangos and arm s length bodies, and now to the National Assembly in Port Louis, Mauritius, which is further from Diego Garcia than London is from Rome. Aboard his luxury jet, he seems more interested in a Gulfstream G700 than the G7 countries, whisking him to the US, the Foreign Secretary might consider a quote from Mr Rubio - Compromise that s not a solution is a waste of created_at. Against that sort of clear thinking, our toadying diplomats look like battery toys plugged into the mains, out of their depth, out of touch, out of control. China knows the true value of bases such as Diego Garcia. It is even building artificial islands, the great wall of sand, in the South China sea as unsinkable aircraft carriers. The US will rightly torpedo Labour s woeful Chagos sell-out. I congratulate my honourable Friend on securing this important and created_atly debate. Does he agree that, despite the best efforts of the Labour Government, there is a long-standing and enduring relationship between the USA, Scotland and the rest of the UK? More importantly from our perspective as Scottish MPs, Tartan Week in New York is a good example of that strong relationship between the US and Scotland. I agree completely. I was privileged to join my honourable Friend at Tartan Week in America, which is a key showcase for all things Scottish. We are lucky that President Trump is effectively an Ayrshire businessman, since he owns a golf course in Scotland. If the Chagos deal were in effect vetoed by America, would our Foreign Secretary dare continue, in the event of such mortification? What price Downing Street s hostage-to-fortune claim that the Foreign Secretary will still be in post at the next election? If their 3-amp fuses do not blow too soon, perhaps our underpowered team might get to discuss defence with America. The US wants NATO to pull its budgetary weight. Might we hear today where Labour are with plans to lift defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, given the first casualty of their mishandling of the economy has been growth? Will it happen, and when? If we are moving ever closer to faceless and distant Strasbourg and Brussels, as yesterday s visit by the PM surely signposts, we ought to consider Ireland, which sums up America s issue with European freeloading on defence. Ireland is not in NATO, yet is under the aegis of the British-supplied nuclear deterrent. The undersea cables that see US tax dollars converted to euros and piled into the coffers of Dublin are at risk from Putin s shadow fleet. Those data cables are as critical today as were the convoys from America and Canada during the battle of the Atlantic, and every bit as vulnerable. The country s only defence, since Ireland has zero underwater capability, is Britain - the same Britain Ireland is happy to traduce in international courts over the troubles. We have a rare window of opportunity with Mr Trump and his White House team, but the puerile insults keep coming. The titanic struggle playing out now is between the oldest superpower, the United States, and the newest, China. Europe, prickling with full outrage at the new US President, is sidelined. It is, at best, indifferent to the UK and wants to make even new defence agreements transactional, all about commercial deals, even as the fires of conflict blaze.\n"

    "title": "Can Malaysia catalyse Asean's fourth reinvention? - Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz",
    "created_at": "2025-02-08",
    "text": "\nKuala Lampur, Feb. 8 -- Asean has never been static. Since its foundation in 1967 via the Bangkok Declaration, our regional grouping has been through several reinventions.\nAsean's first three reinventions\nThe first reinvention, circa 1976 was, expectedly, on regional security, given the on-going Cold War then.\nThe grouping successfully maintained peace and stability for most of the region through frameworks like the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South-east Asia (1976) and the Declaration of Asean Concord (1976). Interestingly, the very first Asean Summit only took place nine years after Asean's establishment, in February 1976, in Bali, Indonesia.\nAsean's second reinvention occurred in the 1990's, where, post-Cold War, it focused on integration. Besides the accessions of Vietnam (1995), Laos and Myanmar (1997), and Cambodia (1999), the major development in this period was the Asean Free Trade Area (AFTA), the groundwater for the Asean Economic Community (AEC). Notably, both the AEC and the Asean Community mark their 10th anniversary this year.\nThis second reinvention period also 'mothered' the Asean Economic Ministers (AEM) Retreat, whose 31st edition will be hosted by MITI in Desaru, Johor, on 27-28 February 2025. The AEM's scope has evolved from reducing tariffs and trade barriers to other major economic undertakings like advancing the AEC and digital integration. At this upcoming AEM Retreat, Malaysia looks forward to presenting the 18 Priority Economic Deliverables (PEDs) to drive regional economic integration, inclusivity, sustainability and digital trade under Asean's Economic Pillar.\nThe third reinvention came in 2007, when we adopted the Asean Charter, the legal basis for the establishment of the Asean Community in 2015. There was a growing recognition that Asean was more potent as a bloc, whose value is more than the sum of its parts, akin to the European Union (EU). While our circumstances are different from the EU's, the common theme for more integration was never in doubt.\nThis lengthy historical discourse is to show that Asean has evolved with the created_ats, identifying challenges and responding appropriately on the regional international order and intra-regional relations.\nWhy a fourth reinvention matters\nIn 2025, my take is that Asean is on the cusp of a fourth reinvention. Among the region's current challenges is navigating the US-China rivalry, particularly over international trade/supply chains and the South China Sea. Additionally, there is the continuing quest to make Asean relevant for ordinary South-east Asians in an increasingly uncertain world.\nGlobally, incidents like the brief TikTok ban may unfortunately be the norm moving forward. The sudden rise of DeepSeek-R1 shows that the West's technological advantage may have a shelf life, reinforcing the fact that this is a space Malaysia and Asean must be in if we want to progress digitally.\nFor Asean to maintain its centrality as a driving force in the regional security architecture, Malaysia, as the 2025 Chair should engineer the fourth reinvention, although its final shape must, of course, be the consensus of all member states.\nMalaysia laying the groundwork\nI would argue that Malaysia's 2025 Asean agenda is laying the groundwork for the region's next reinvention. To cite just MITI's end of things, the beefing up of the Asean Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) that we are pursuing will boost intra-regional trade, which is a very effective, necessary hedge against the on-going global trade wars.\nMeanwhile, the completion of the Asean Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) is not only about enhancing regional e-commerce but strengthening cybersecurity and data governance through common standards and principles. This is crucial to not only enshrine the credibility of our region's online economy but also protect its populace.\nProgress on the Asean Power Grid, plus the stronger regional cooperation on electric vehicles (EV) and semiconductors that we are seeking will ensure South-east Asia becomes a hub for these crucial future economic activities.\nThe upcoming Asean-GCC Summit and several of our members joining the BRICS reinforce our region's willingness to not only engage across the political/geographical spectrum, but indeed, to diversify our economic relations.\nWe are also planning to unveil the Asean Community Vision (ACV) 2045, which is meant to succeed the current Asean Vision 2025. The ACV 2045 is a longer, 20-year undertaking containing several strategic plans touching on political security, economy, socio-culture and connectivity. The ACV will provide the building blocks for the region's future - and perhaps prepare it for its fifth reinvention.\nIn short, Asean's fourth reinvention ought to focus on deepening regional integration, preparing its economies for technological shifts, while maintaining strategic autonomy, and ensuring its relevance to its people. I see this as totally compatible with our 2025 tagline of \"inclusivity and sustainability.\"\nAsean must be strategic\nThis approach may take created_at to be accepted by all Asean Member States (AMS), but it goes to show that South-east Asia matters. Perhaps, this is also why so many people have their own visions for what it should do. This debate should be welcomed.\nStill, for all the criticism of the text through the years, it says a lot that Asean has continued to grow. And rather than see our expansion as a threat or provocation, most major powers are eager to engage with us. Maybe this means that, like running, there's something to be said for working at one's own created_at and pace.\nAsean has never let itself be forced into making zero-sum choices, whether politically or economically, no matter how loud or pressing either extreme may be. We must be what is in South-east Asia's best interests - not what others want.\nI am confident that if we focus on the essentials, as laid out by our PEDs, while never losing sight of what Asean Centrality really is about, the fourth reinvention, whatever shape it takes, will keep our region open, free and prosperous, thriving and contributing positively to the global order.\n* Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz is Malaysia's Investment, Trade and Industry Minister.\n** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

    "title": "Empire Redux: Putin, Xi And Now Trump Ushering In New Imperial Age",
    "created_at": "2025-02-08",
    "text": "\nLink to Image\nLink to Story\nOver the past few weeks the new US president, Donald Trump, has repeatedly claimed that the United States should\"take back\" the Panama Canal and that it should assume control of Greenland - one way or another. He has talked of Canada becoming America's 51st state and now he even wants to\"take over\" the Gaza Strip to convert it into a\"Riviera\" on the eastern Mediterranean.It's as if the US president believes that his country should be an empire. In this Trump seems to be emulating China's Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin of Russia, leaders he has said he admires and who have themselves shown some clear imperial tendencies in recent years.\nUnder Putin, Russia has supported secessionist regions, such as Transnistria and Abkhazia, fought wars in Georgia and Ukraine and actively interfered in the affairs of Syria and assorted African countries.\nIn 2022, Russia even launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, claiming that Ukraine was historically inseparable from Russia , but that hostile Western influences were trying to destroy that unity.\nChina, meanwhile, has militarized a number of small uninhabited islands in the South China Sea. It has built 27 installations on disputed islands in the Spratly and Paracel island group that are also claimed by other countries including Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia.\nThis has prompted a flurry of development , as other countries in the region have raced to establish their own footholds in the disputed but very resource-rich, region. Beijing also maintains its claim over Taiwan, which it says is an inalienable part of China, which it wants to \"come home.\"\nLatest stories Trump plan to 'clean out' Gaza of Palestinians will be resisted Pharmaceuticals become a battlefield in the Sino-US trade war Could US forcing Panama to exit China's Belt and Road set pattern?Empires and nation-statesMost people assumed that the age of empires had been relegated to the dustbin of history. But this is by no means a straightforward proposition.\nUntil relatively recently, the rise and fall of empires had dominated much of recorded history. Nation-states only appeared at the end of the 18th century . And as those states rose to prominence many too displayed imperial inclinations.\nSo the US, fresh from throwing off the yoke of the British empire, wasted little created_at in expanding its borders westward , acquiring - whether by conquest or purchase - large swaths of new territory in what effectively turned a small group of east coast states into a continental empire.\nMeanwhile, other newly minted nation-states such as Italy and Germany also aspired to acquire overseas empires and involved themselves, with varying success, building what turned out to be relatively short-lived colonial empires in Africa and elsewhere.\nMost traditional dynastic empires, meanwhile, began to adopt various aspects of the nation-state model, such as conscription, legal equality and political participation. The decades following the Second World War are often seen by historians as a period of decolonization by traditional imperial powers such as Britain and France.\nBut the transition from empire to nation-states was far from smooth. Most imperial governments hoped to transform their empires into more egalitarian commonwealths, while retaining a degree of influence.\nThis they did with varying degrees of success and often under extreme duress, as with France in Algeria and Vietnam, or under great economic pressure, such as with Britain and India . The real age of the nation-state didn't begin until the 1960s.\nThe return of empire?Today, the world consists of about 200 independent countries , the overwhelming majority nation-states. Nonetheless, one could argue that empires - or at least imperial tendencies - have never totally disappeared.\nFrance, for instance, frequently interfered in many of its former colonies in Africa. However, these military interventions were not meant to permanently occupy new territories.\nToday, imperial tendencies seem to resurface around the world. The past, however, tends not to repeat itself. Massive wars of conquest or attempts to create new overseas empires are unlikely in the immediate future. Most imperial expansions are currently sought close to home.\nWhat is striking is that Putin, Xi and Trump all use fierce nationalist rhetoric to justify their imperialist designs. Putin, as we have seen, claims the indivisibility of Ukraine and Russia and blames\"Nazis\" for trying to turn Russia's sister state towards the west. He used it as a justification for invading Ukraine in February 2022.\nXi, in turn, often maintains that Communist China has finally overcome the\"century of humiliation\", in which the country was the plaything of foreign powers. They both seem to yearn for past imperial greatness.\nSign up for one of our free newsletters\nThe Daily ReportStart your day right with Asia created_ats' top storiesAT Weekly ReportA weekly roundup of Asia created_ats' most-read stories\nThe Russian Federation aims to undo the dissolution of the Soviet Union, communist China looks back to the Qing empire . Interestingly, under its increasingly authoritarian leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey - another regional power with imperial inclinations - similarly finds inspiration in the Ottoman Empire .\nThe US case seems to be more complex, but in fact is very similar. Thus, Trump argues that the Panama Canal, which has long been administered by the US, was foolishly returned to Panama by Jimmy Carter and claims that it is now controlled by China. He will, he says, return it to the US .\nTrump also refers to America's \"Manifest Destiny\" , the 19th-century belief that American settlers were destined to expand to the Pacific coast. These days his aspirations are northwards rather than to the west. The president also wants to plant the US flag on Mars, taking his imperial dreams into outer space.\nIf the US joins China and Russia in violating recognized borders, the international, rights-based order could be in danger. The signs are not very positive. Taking steps to illegally annex territories could blow up the entire international edifice.\nEric Storm is senior lecturer in general history, Leiden University\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

    "text": "\nThe Global Risk Report-2025, outlining the major global risk factors on three terms-current, medium, and long till 2035-was recently presented at the World Economic Forum.\nTanuj Goswami\n(tanujuri03@gmail.com)\nT he Global Risk Report-2025, outlining the major global risk factors on three terms-current, medium, and long till 2035-was recently presented at the World Economic Forum, following the Global Risk Perception Survey (GRPS)-2025 having interviewed a large group of renowned global experts in different fields.\nThe World Economic Forum, in its annual meeting held in Switzerland, singled out global conflicts/wars as the greatest risk facing the world in the current year out of 33 risk factors as per GRPS 2025.\nThe emerging major risks pertain primarily to environmental, societal, geopolitical, geo-economic, and technological issues. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, raging conflicts in the Middle East drawing into its fold big nations with their proxies, and the escalating crisis in Sudan and elsewhere have topped conflicts/wars as the biggest risk factors with accelerating geopolitical and geo-economic crises. Israel's seven front wars at a created_at in the world's most volatile and chaotic region are a case in point, unheard of in this small nation's historical past for their very survival.\nEvolving war scenarios and their consequential effect in many parts of the world have been very distasteful and damaging enough; further, it is reported that the perception of unilateralism tends to take firm root, outpacing the only created_at-tested doctrine of multilateralism/bilateralism to mitigate the crisis in conflict regions across the world.\nThe situation looks critically grim considering the cascading worse impact on humanitarian issues that are looming ominously in some parts of the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, and Eastern Europe.\nThe multiple crises of conflicts/wars have meanwhile precipitated societal polarisation, incoherence, acute deprivation, and human suffering, leading to large-scale displacement and forced migration of millions of people, reaching an all-created_at higher dimension. In the year 2024 alone, more than 200,000 people were killed on the battlefields, many millions were fatally injured, and thousands of infrastructures like roads, bridges, agricultural firms, power stations, water plants, markets, hospitals, schools, buildings, and buildings were reduced to rubble.\nIt is very distressing that globally the military expenditure has reached a peak level of $2.4 trillion in 2023. The ongoing trend and race for arming oneself with the most modern and sophisticated war equipment have escalated manifold. Such a mad rush for garnering laser-guided missiles and other lethal weapons has heightened distrust and animosity between nations. The creation of new blocks, the assertion of one-sided authority on coastal/sea routes, and the claim over nearby sovereign territories by some countries have made matters complicated.\nTo top it all off, the recent confirmation by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) about Iran's near capability to produce weapon-grade enriched uranium has unnerved the entire Western world. Iran, along with its proxies, has openly declared its objective of totally wiping out the Jewish state of Israel from the Middle East, which has sparked a new orientation of security concern.\nMeanwhile, the threat of nuclear weapons by nuclear-powered nations is alarmingly increasing, and the option of their use is kept open and made public by Russia and North Korea against their adversaries. Russia, China, and North Korea have been a growing concern for the NATO bloc, and the situation will turn critical if the deteriorating US-China trade war and the South China Sea tussle in the neighbouring Asia-Pacific region are not scaled down.\nThe disastrous effects of conflicts, the high cost of living, widening inequalities in terms of income, shortages of foodstuffs, rampant inflation, bad politics, debt issues, human trafficking, large criminal activities, gang rivalry, drug abuse, and syndicates make enforcement of law and order a herculean task for the enforcing authorities and the regulators in many countries.\nFurthermore, it is most unfortunate that the planetary consensus is receding and becoming far-fetched even at the World Forums. The dreaded and greatest risk of extreme climatic events of this century is beginning to trigger irreversible changes. The COP-29 held a few months back in Azerbaijan cast a long shadow on critically reaching unanimity on the most important issues, like funding for the developing nation for a transition to clean and green energy, and also the failure to get the developed nation to commit to funding in climate mitigation efforts.\nLikewise, the 5th and final Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meeting held in Busan, South Korea, following arduous years of work to develop an International Legally Binding Instrument on Plastic Pollution, including the Marine Environment, failed to reach consensus on a World Plastic Treaty against plastic pollution.\nIt is ironic that the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), a very high-profile world text constituted to hammer out and arrive at a consensual point on plastic menace by way of a treaty, couldn't get to the unanimity of opinion even after a series of intensive meetings/discussions with all concerned stakeholders worldwide.\nThe nations of the planet Earth woefully fail to fathom the impending dangers and their acute catastrophic fallout. Such unpreparedness and insensitiveness will certainly lead to an ecological collapse beyond redemption.\nThis alarm bell has been ringing for quite a long created_at. So far, the pace of rapidly accelerating ecological degradation and counter-green actions has been inversely proportional, forcing us to be stuck in doom and gloom. The deadline set for 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C and reduce gas emissions by 43% is unlikely to be met.\nMeanwhile, many parts of the world are witnessing unprecedented bouts of floods, torrential rain, tornadoes, wildfires, dwindling farm produce, severe drought, water scarcity, hot climate, a spike of unknown diseases, pathogens, famine, et al. The situation looks pretty stark, alarming, and reiterative.\nSome nations' prevailing tendency to oppose conventional ideas of world peace, world order, and mutual understanding and their attempt to relegate the august World Forums to non-entity cost the world dearly. They incentivised deep distrust, hatred, partisanship, and scepticism among countries, oftenleadingto conflict situations.\nSo a broad outlook for preventive action, peace initiatives, diplomatic parleys, bilateralism, ceasefire, people-to-people contacts, global cooperation, and large investments for sustainable development is said to be the key to reinvigorating a decent, peaceful, virtuous approach to a renewed world peace and order.\nSeveral countries have been reasonably clamouring for restructuring the Security Council, the most influential text of the UN, which has the potential to turn the tide for a rule-based world order. So, reforms in the UN and its ecosystem are considered indispensable at this hour for a better, nonpartisan, peaceful, representative, rule-bound world with a clean and green environment.\n"

    "text": "\nPhilippines\nA flurry of naval drills surrounding the Philippines involving the United States and its partners has prompted complaints from Beijing, which claims the entire South China Sea and accuses Manila of colluding with others to destabilise the region.\nThe US 7th Fleet based in Japan said forces from Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and the US conducted a \"multilateral Maricreated_at Co-operative Activity\" within the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone on Friday.\nSuch drills \"strengthen the interoperability of our defence/armed forces doctrines, tactics, techniques, and procedures,\" the fleet said in a news release. The manoeuvres were taking place within the Philippines' zone, but the fleet gave no details on the exact location.\nMore exercises involving the US, Japan and France were planned for later in the week in the Philippines Sea, which China does not claim.\nThat exercise \"is designed to advance co-ordination and co-operation between French, Japanese and US maricreated_at forces while simultaneously demonstrating capabilities in multi-domain operations\", the fleet said.\nThe US aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, French carrier Charles De Gaulle and Japan's Izumo-class multi-functional destroyer Kaga will take part in the drill starting today, along with their escorts and air wings, the fleet said.\nFrance's participation is especially significant because of the distance from its home base, 6000km away in Toulouse, commander of the Carrier Strike Group Rear Admiral Jacques Mallard was quoted as saying.\nMeanwhile, Tian Junli, spokesperson for China's Southern Theatre Command, accused the Philippines of \"colluding with outside countries to organise 'so-called joint patrols',\" which he said \"destabilise the region,\" Chinese state media said on Friday.\nTian said the Philippines' actions were \"an attempt to endorse its 'illegal claims' in the South China Sea and \"undermine China's maricreated_at rights and interests.\" He specifically pointed to US-Philippines joint patrols on Thursday and said China had carried out its own patrols in the region that day.\nChina is one of six regional powers that claims the strategic South China Sea in part or in whole, ignoring a ruling by a United Nations-backed court that tossed out most of its claims and building human-made islands equipped with airstrips and other infrastructure of military use. China's coast guard and maricreated_at militia frequently clash with ships from fellow claimants Vietnam and the Philippines.\nThough it claims not to disrupt shipping or overflights in the sea, through which an estimated US$5 trillion (NZ$8.8 trillion) in global trade transits each year, China is adamantly opposed to foreign military shipping in the area. The waterway is also believed to be sitting atop vast undersea deposits of oil and gas and while China says it wants to come to a negotiated agreement about the use of the sea, such efforts have made little progress.\nChina says the US and other countries that don't border on the sea should have no say in affairs concerning it, although the US - which takes no formal stand on sovereignty issues involving the sea - has maintained bases and alliances in the region long before China made its formal claim to sovereignty using the so-called \"eight dash line.\" - AP\n--------------------\nCAPTION:\nTwo Philippine Air Force FA-50 fighter jets alongside two US Air Force B-1 bombers during a joint patrol and training mission over the South China Sea.

    "text": "\nThe Philippines' potential purchase of more fighter jets from South Korea and the two countries' growing military collaboration could push Beijing to feel more \"insecure\" as tensions roil the contested South China Sea, according to analysts. \nManila is considering buying an additional 12 units of the FA-50 Fighting Eagle Block 20, South Korea's supersonic combat aircraft, the Inquirer, a Philippine news outlet, reported in January, citing defence department procurement data. \nThe Fighting Eagle is a variant of the FA-50 with an improved capability for beyond-visual-range air-to-air missions. \nThe potential 40 billion Philippine peso (HK$5.37 billion) deal was expected to be finalised by the middle of the year and would double Manila's export-variant FA-50PH fleet, according to the report.  \nThe Philippine Air Force currently operates 12 units bought in the early 2010s. \nManila is ramping up its modernisation efforts within its military, especially the air force, amid increasing tensions with Beijing in the South China Sea. \nThe Philippines is one of the oldest US defence allies in the Asia-Pacific, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reaffirmed Washington's commitment to Manila as \"ironclad\" under their mutual defence treaty.  \nTensions with China in the resource-rich waters have escalated since Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr took office in 2022. Marcos has made the US alliance a cornerstone of his foreign policy, unlike his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte - who pivoted away from the US and was more open to diverse partnerships, including with Beijing. \nIn October, Marcos signed into law the Self-Reliant Defence Posture (SRDP) Revitalisation Act, as part of efforts to revamp the Philippine defence industry in response to PLA activities in the South China Sea.  \nThe act, initiated by his father, Ferdinand Marcos Snr, aims to \"bolster the country's defence strategies through the strength of its own resources and capabilities\", according to the Philippine presidential office.  \nChester Cabalza, founding president of the International Development and Security Cooperation, a think tank in Manila, said the Philippines had a \"soft spot\" for South Korea's defence industry as Koreans studied Marcos Snr's SRDP programme when he was in power. \n\"This defence relationship is personal and professional at the same created_at for the Philippines,\" Cabalza said, noting how Manila had been able to \"revitalise its new SRDP law after benchmarking from Korea's advancement of defence technology and sales\".  \n\"Beijing will feel insecure with this special and increasing defence collaboration ... as the two democratic countries speed up their military exchanges and support ... each other amid the volatile regional security architecture,\" he added. \nJoshua Bernard Espena, a lecturer in international relations at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, said the \"primary reason\" behind the planned purchase of the FA-50 was to \"internally balance against systemic pressures of China's multidomain threat to [Manila's] territorial integrity\" in the South China Sea. \nThe Philippines would use the extra jets \"not only for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions but also for air-to-air as well as air-to-ground or air-to-sea targets\", Espena said. \n\"FA-50s can serve anti-air warfare and anti-surface assignments. These functions are a break from the Philippine Air Force's menial task of ISR and HADR [Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief] functions to support the Philippine Army and Philippine Marine Corps' roles in internal security operations,\" Espena said. \nThe FA-50 is manufactured by Korea Aerospace Industries. The design is based on South Korea's first supersonic advanced jet trainer and light attack aircraft, the T-50 Golden Eagle. \nThe FA-50 fighters were described as \"game changers\" by the Philippine armed forces in 2017, when they played a crucial role in helping government forces retake Marawi City on the southern island of Mindanao after a five-month battle with Islamic State-linked militant groups. \nAkhil Kadidal, an aviation expert at global military and aerospace intelligence company Janes, said the Philippine Air Force had an \"urgent requirement\" for new combat aircraft, and the FA-50 was a cost-effective option. \n\"Being a light attack aircraft, the FA-50PH has a lower acquisition cost than the multirole combat aircraft [that] Manila is considering for procurement under its Multi-Role Fighter project. At the same created_at, the FA-50PH also has capable systems found in more expensive aircraft,\" Kadidal said. \n\"The [Philippine Air Force] is already familiar with the aircraft, its capabilities, and sustainment. An acquisition of additional FA-50PHs indicates that [it] has confidence in the aircraft, and its potential cost-for-value.\" \n\"Anything that allows the Philippines' defence capability to get better will earn the ire of China, [which knows that Manila] will do what it can to convince others to join its side by making its geostrategic location more relevant than ever,\" Espena said.\n"

    "text": "\nPrototype detectors have been sent deep into the South China Sea by Chinese scientists to test the possibility of building a ­massive underwater observatory that would be used to search for neutrinos - tiny, elusive sub­atomic particles from deep space. \nIf it all goes as planned, it could take scientists a step closer to uncovering the mysterious origin of cosmic rays. \nEquipment, including self- developed, highly sensitive detector units and an LED light source for calibration, was placed at a depth of precisely 1,600 metres last month with the help of the submersible Shenhai Yongshi, or Deep-Sea Warrior, according to the Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing, which is leading the project. \nNow connected to China's national underwater scientific observation network for power and data transmission, the detectors were waiting in the darkness to capture faint flashes of light when neutrinos passed through, the institute said via WeChat. \nIt is all part of a bid to build the High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT), which will be the world's largest underwater neutrino observatory with more than 55,000 detectors suspended along thousands of strings, covering 30 cubic km of ocean. \"The stable operation of the prototype detectors marks a ­significant step forward in our preliminary research for the HUNT project,\" the institute said.  \n\"Once complete, it will ­position China at the forefront of neutrino astronomy.\" \nThe South China Sea is not the only candidate site for HUNT.  \nLast spring, researchers deployed prototype detectors at a depth of 1,300 metres in Siberia's Lake Baikal, and conducted on-site testing with Russian scientists involved in the Baikal-GVD neutrino experiment, according to the institute. \nCosmic rays are key to understanding some of the universe's most extreme events, such as supernova explosions and galaxy collisions, and offer insights into the fundamental nature of the cosmos. However, most cosmic rays are electrically charged atomic nuclei, which get deflected by magnetic fields as they speed through space. Only a small fraction - photons and neutral particles such as neutrinos - can travel in a straight line and be used as probes to locate the sources of cosmic radiation.  \nSince neutrinos rarely interact with matter, the best way to detect them is building large detectors in clean water or transparent ice.  \nWhen neutrinos, or \"ghost particles\", collide with atoms in these environments, they produce electrically charged secondary particles that emit so-called Cherenkov light, which can be picked up by the detectors. \nCurrently, two major neutrino telescopes are in operation: the Russia-led GVD in Baikal at a size of 0.5 cubic km, and the United States-led IceCube in Antarctica at 1 cubic km.  \nA third is under construction in the Mediterranean Sea. \nWhile both IceCube and Baikal-GVD are planned to expand to about 8 cubic km, Chinese researchers have ­estimated a minimum of 30 cubic km is needed to reliably observe and confirm the sources of cosmic neutrinos. \nMore than a dozen Chinese universities and institutes are involved in the feasibility study for HUNT.\n"
