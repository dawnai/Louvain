    "text": "\nManila may resort to measures such as filing another international lawsuit like the 2016 case against Beijing to stop China's continuing intimidating actions in the Philippines' South China Sea waters, a senior Filipino official warned.\nManila has tried options including protests and official diplomatic complaints, and yet a Chinese coast guard ship - the world's largest - is again in Philippine waters, said a spokesman of the Task Force for the West Philippine Sea, which is Manila's name for the waters it claims.\nThe Philippine task force spokesman Jonathan Malaya explained at a press conference on Tuesday that Manila was running out of options in dealing with Beijing's continued actions to assert what China claims is its sovereignty over the West Philippine Sea.\nSince Ferdinand Marcos Jr. assumed the presidency in June 2022, his administration has filed a total of 199 diplomatic protests against Chinese vessels and activities in the waterway.\nReporters asked whether the Philippines was thinking of filing another lawsuit akin to the one adjudicated in its favor and against Beijing in 2016 by an international arbitral tribunal.\nWill [the presence of the Chinese ship in Manila-claimed waters] lead to another case? All options are on the table, he answered.\n[T]he closer the 'monster' ship is [to] Philippine waters, the more it [raises tensions] and the more the Philippine government contemplates things it was not contemplating before.\nMalaya said that China was pushing us to the wall but the Philippines would not back down.\nWe do not waver or cower in the face of intimidation. On the contrary, it strengthens our resolve because we know we are in the right.\nThe Monster refers to the giant 12,000-ton China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel 5901, which patrolled the disputed Scarborough Shoal area in recent days.\nThe behemoth subsequently moved to the northwestern coast of the Philippines' Luzon island on Tuesday, where it was last spotted some 77 nautical miles (143 kilometers) from the shoreline.\nChina responded to Malay's comments saying it maintained its claim in the waterway. The CCG vessels' activities there were lawful and fully justified, added the superpower's Foreign Ministry spokesperson.\nChina's sovereignty and rights and interests in the South China Sea were established in the long course of history, and are solidly grounded in history and the law and compliant with the international law and practice, spokesman Guo Jiakun said Monday at a news conference.\nWe call on the Philippines once again to immediately stop all infringement activities, provocations and false accusations, and stop all its actions that jeopardize peace and stability and complicate the situation in the South China Sea.\nLocated about 125 nautical miles (232 km) from Luzon Island, the Scarborough Shoal - known as Bajo de Masinloc in the Philippines - has been under China's de facto control since 2012.\nBeijing's possession of the shoal forced Manila to file a lawsuit at the world court in The Hague.\nThe court's international arbitral tribunal in 2016 ruled in Manila's favor but Beijing has never acknowledged that decision.\nPhilippine officials on Monday said the government had filed yet another diplomatic protest over the presence of Chinese ships in waters within its exclusive economic zone.\nIn recent years, a slew of countries, including the United States, Japan, Australia, France and United Kingdom, have also supported Manila and carried out joint sails with the Philippines in the contested sea.\nReporters asked Malaya whether the Philippine government was considering asking its foreign allies the U.S. and Japan for help in driving away the Chinese vessel.\nWe're keeping our options open, answered Malaya.\nNow the ball is in the court of the PRC (People's Republic of China), he said.\nRecently, the Philippine Senate ratified a so-called Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) with Japan, allowing the two allied nations to deploy troops on each other's soil for military exercises.\nThe RAA - which will take effect once Philippine President Marcos signs off on it and Japan's legislature ratifies it - is the first of its kind signed by Tokyo with an Asian country.\nJapan, unlike the Philippines, does not have territorial claims that overlap with China's expansive ones in the South China Sea.\nBut Tokyo has a separate dispute with Beijing over a group of uninhabited islands in the Senkaku chain (also known as the Diaoyu Islands) in the East China Sea.\nOn Monday, the leaders of the Philippines, Japan and the United States held a telephone summit to discuss regional security and their countries' continuing cooperation amid China's activities in the disputed South China Sea.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:\nSenior Philippine diplomats confronted Chinese counterparts in face-to-face talks about China's \"monster\" coast guard ship intruding into Manila's territorial waters, as the two sides met to discuss the hot-button issue of the South China Sea.\nForeign Affairs Undersecretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro led the Philippine delegation in the 10th Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea, or BCM, which took place on Thursday in the Chinese city of Xiamen.\nChinese Vice Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong headed the Chinese delegation in the BCM, a series of bilateral talks that were started in 2017 with the aim of lowering tensions between the two countries rival claimants over the contested waterway.\nThe Philippine side expressed \"serious concern\" about the presence and activities of China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels lately within Manila's exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, including the 12,000-ton ship, dubbed \"The Monster.\"\nCCG 5901, the world's largest coast guard ship, had been spotted patrolling the resource-rich Scarborough Shoal area in recent days and waters off the coast of Luzon, the main island in the Philippines.\nManila had already lodged protests and diplomatic complaints about the ship's intimidating presence in Philippine-claimed waters.\nEarlier this week, a Philippine National Security official said China was \"pushing us to the wall\" as he indicated that Manila was considering pursuing a new lawsuit against Beijing over the South China Sea.\nWhile CCG 5901 had not carried out any dangerous maneuvers so far, Philippine officials said its activities within Manila's waters were not backed by any international law, according to a statement from the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs.\n\"Our position is clear and consistent, but so is our willingness to engage in dialogue. We firmly believe that despite the unresolved challenges and differences, there is genuine space for diplomatic and pragmatic cooperation in dealing with our issues in the South China Sea,\" the statement quoted Lazaro as saying at the meeting.\nChina's actions were \"inconsistent\" with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, which both Manila and Beijing had signed, and the recently passed Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, according to the Philippine foreign office.\nBeijing earlier said that the presence of its ships in Scarborough was \"fully justified,\" reiterating its jurisdiction over the shoal.\n\"We call on the Philippines once again to immediately stop all infringement activities, provocations and false accusations, and stop all its actions that jeopardize peace and stability and complicate the situation in the South China Sea,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Tuesday.\nLocated about 125 nautical miles (232 km) from Luzon island, Scarborough Shoal known as Bajo de Masinloc in the Philippines has been under China's de facto control since 2012.\nBeijing's possession of the shoal forced Manila to file a lawsuit at the world court in The Hague.\nFour years later, an international arbitration tribunal ruled in Manila's favor but Beijing has never acknowledged that decision, insisting on its historical claims over the waterway.\nAnother flashpoint\nAt Thursday's meeting, the two sides also agreed to keep implementing a \"provisional understanding\" regarding Philippine resupply missions to the BRP Sierra Madre, a decrepit World War II-era military ship stationed in Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal, another disputed South China Sea feature.\nCCG vessels had been regularly blocking Philippine ships carrying supplies and troops to the shoal. But the two countries arrived at a provisional agreement in July, following a dramatic standoff the previous month between Filipino servicemen and CCG personnel at Second Thomas Shoal, during which a Philippine serviceman lost a finger.\nPhilippine and Chinese officials, however, have not yet publicly disclosed the official document of the agreement or its details, with both sides making their own claims about the deal's contents.\nAt the talks on Thursday, both sides acknowledged the deal's \"positive outcomes\" and \"agreed to continue its implementation to sustain the de-escalation of tensions without prejudice to respective national positions,\" Manila's foreign office said.\nBoth sides also \"agreed to reinvigorate the platform for coast guard cooperation\" but no specific details were provided.\nIn 2016, under then-President Rodrigo Duterte who adopted a pro-Beijing policy, the two nations' coast guards formed the Joint Coast Guard Committee (JCGC), establishing a hotline between the two maricreated_at law enforcement agencies.\nIn January 2023, amid increasing tensions in the disputed waters, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to set up a communication line between their foreign ministries.\nBut a few months later, Manila officials said that China could not be reached in created_ats of high tensions at sea.\nBenarNews is an RFA-affiliated online news organization.\n"

    "text": "\n The United States will not allow China to prevail with its illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive acts and give in to Beijing's muscle flexing in the South China Sea, US Ambassador MaryKay Carlson said yesterday.\nCarlson said the US is working with the Philippines to ensure that Philippine interests and international law are upheld.\nShe said that if the purpose of positioning 'is to flex their muscle, maybe even doing so ahead of the US inauguration, we're not going to cave to that.'\n'We're going to continue to work with our friends and partners, especially here in the Philippines. We're going to continue to amplify the Philippines' message. We're going to continue to uphold international law,' Carlson said during her visit to The STAR.\nThe Philippines protested China's deployment of its largest coast guard vessel, known as the 'monster ship,' within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ), saying it is alarming and clearly intended to intimidate fishermen operating around a shoal in the contested waters of the South China Sea.\nThe ambassador stated that the US will push back on any attempts to circumvent international law through bullying practices.\n'It's illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive or what some people call gray zone tactics. We will not let them prevail,' Carlson said. 'We'll continue to expose them...\n'The intent has been to flex muscle and we will continue to push back,' she added.\nChina was accused of pushing its South China Sea claims close to the Philippine coast to normalize its illegal grab of most of the waterway.\nCommon ground\nThe Philippines and China agreed to seek common ground and find ways to cooperate despite their disagreements in the South China Sea, their foreign ministries said on Thursday, as heated rows persist over vessels deployed around disputed features.\nThe two countries on Thursday held the 10th round of talks under a bilateral consultation mechanism set up to address issues in the South China Sea, where disputes have been frequent and tense, with ties at their lowest point in years.\nBoth countries said they agreed to advance coast guard and marine scientific cooperation and pledged to resolve issues peacefully.\n'We firmly believe that despite the unresolved challenges and differences, there is genuine space for diplomatic and pragmatic cooperation in dealing with our issues in the South China Sea,' Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Theresa Lazaro said in her opening remarks at the 10th Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea in Xiamen, according to a statement.\nChina, through Vice Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong, said it called on the Philippines to remain committed to resolving differences through dialogue and consultation.\nBoth agreed to boost communication and deepen dialogue, but also called out each other out over recent standoffs.\nUS ally the Philippines said it had expressed serious concern about the conduct of China's coast guard, including its sustained presence in Manila's exclusive economic zone.\nChina, for its part, said it lodged complaints over recent 'maricreated_at infringements and provocations' and for 'hyping up' maricreated_at disputes.\nChina's expansive territorial claims in the key maricreated_at trade route overlap with the EEZs of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.\nA 2016 ruling of an international arbitral tribunal said Beijing's claims, based on its historic maps, have no basis under international law, a decision China does not recognize.\n'Monster ship'\nAt the dialogue in Xiamen, the Philippines also raised the presence and maricreated_at activities, particularly that of CCG 5901 or 'monster ship' and CCG 3103 in Philippine maricreated_at zones that are inconsistent with the 1982 UNCLOS and the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act.\nThe so-called monster ship of the China Coast Guard (CCG) remained inside the West Philippine Sea and is being driven away from the coastline of Zambales by a patrol vessel of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).\nLast Jan. 15, CCG patrol ship 5901, with a length of 165 meters and weight of 12,000 tons, sent a radio challenge to PCG's offshore patrol vessel BRP Gabriela Silang, stating it was 'violating the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea,' according to a video shared to reporters by Commodore Jay Tarriela, spokesman for the PCG on West Philippine Sea concerns.\nHe maintained the movements of the CCG vessel 'have not been continuous or expeditious, failing to meet the necessary criteria for exercising the right of innocent passage.'\n'In response, BRP Gabriela Silang has effectively maintained a protective position through skillful seamanship, successfully keeping the China Coast Guard at an average distance of 60-70 nautical miles from the Philippine coastline,' he pointed out.\nTarriela asserted CCG's sustained presence in the West Philippine Sea - defined by the 2016 arbitral ruling, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and Republic Act 12064 or the Maricreated_at Zones Act - 'disregards the more critical issue of the China Coast Guard's illegal presence within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.'\nThe effort of Gabriela Silang to continuously follow CCG 5901 was 'vital to prevent it from approaching the Zambales coast,' he added.\nFrom Jan. 4 to 15, Tarriela has reported about CCG's presence off the shores of Zambales 11 created_ats, almost every night.\nIndo-Pacific sky jump\nParticipating for the very first created_at, Philippine Army paratroopers joined their fellow airborne unit soldiers from at least 10 countries in this year's New Year Indo-Pacific Jump held in Japan over the weekend.\nThe delegation, led by Army vice commander Maj. Gen. Leodevic Guinid, joined other allied nations in the event on Jan. 11 and 12 at the 1st Airborne Brigade, Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), Camp Narashino, Chiba prefecture.\nArmy spokesman Col. Louie Dema-ala said the Special Forces Regiment commander, Brig. Gen. Rosendo Abad Jr., also joined the airborne troopers in demonstrating Philippine Army's military free fall and airborne capabilities, 'manifesting the Philippine Army's readiness to conduct airborne operations in special operations to support Territorial Defense Operations.'\nImmediately following the aerial showcase were Simulated Air Assault Operations featuring the demonstration of the participating units from the United States Army, US Marine Corps, US Air Force, Singaporean Army, Australian Army, Royal Netherlands Army, French Army, Canadian Army, British Army, Polish Land Forces, Italian Army, German Army and 1st Airborne Brigade, JGSDF.\nDema-ala said the simulation showcased the capabilities and synchronized collaborations of the Indo-Pacific nations in addressing common threats or adversaries in the region.\nAccording to him, the New Year Jump in Indo-Pacific in Japan has been held annually since 1974 to pray for the safety of airborne jumps throughout the year and foster greater understanding and confidence in the JGSDF.\nHe said the activity also aims to build relationships of trust, as well as to strengthen cooperation among the Airborne Forces and disseminate strategic messages to contribute to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. \n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-17",
    "text": "\n             (CNN) - Scientists have newly identified a \"supergiant\" sea bug species after purchasing crustaceans from fishermen and restaurants in Vietnam to study the growing popularity of the creatures as a local delicacy.\nThe deep-sea critter, now called Bathynomus vaderi, got its name after researchers noticed its head shared a resemblance to the helmet worn by iconic \"Star Wars\" villain Darth Vader.\nThe scientists officially described the newfound species on Tuesday in the journal ZooKeys, confirming that some elements of B. vaderi's text structure differed greatly from other Bathynomus specimens found in the South China Sea.\nSupergiant sea bugs, including B. vaderi, are members of the isopod family, characterized by their hard, protective exoskeleton and seven pairs of legs. The largest specimen in the study weighed more than 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) and measured 32.5 cencreated_atters long (12.8 inches), making B. vaderi one of the world's largest known isopods.\nThe overall text structure of Bathynomus crustaceans is similar to many shallow-water cirolanids - the isopod family it belongs to - but these deep-sea creatures have evolved to be significantly larger, according to study coauthor Dr. Conni Sidabalok, a researcher with the National Research and Innovation Agency in Indonesia.\nMost isopods are incredibly small, typically measuring less than 2.5 cencreated_atters (1 inch) in length. This disparity in sizemakes the discovery of such a huge specimen particularly remarkable, said Dr. Lanna Cheng, professor emeritus of marine biology at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the study.\nIdentifying a species that's new to science\nFishermen who caught B. vaderi were deep-sea trawling in the South China Sea about 50 nautical miles offshore of the city of Quy Nhon in south-central Vietnam, which is west of the Spratly Islands.\nB. vaderi are bottom dwellers that feed on dead animals, recycling nutrients as part of the deep-sea food chain, Sidabalok said.\nShe noted that Bathynomus' massive size may aid its survival in the ocean's abyss or provide a competitive advantage over other scavengers.\nCurrently, there are only 11 known \"supergiant\" and nine \"giant\" Bathynomus species, with several awaiting formal description, according to the study. B. vaderi is only the second recorded supergiant isopod species discovered in the South China Sea.\nHowever, because these crustaceans inhabit such deep waters, distinguishing B. vaderi from other species was a laborious process for the research team.\nUnlike other recorded supergiant isopods, B. vaderi possesses a unique feature: The last segment of its back legs narrows at the end and curves slightly backward, according to the study.\nTo confirm B. vaderi's uniqueness, Sidabalok and her colleagues examined specimens of related species from museum collections across various countries and collaborated with other experts. In addition, the researchers analyzed the DNA of B. vaderi, but the lack of genetic data for many Bathynomus species presented additional challenges in the identification process.\nVietnamese delicacy vulnerable to overfishing\nIn recent years, other Bathynomus species, such as B. jamesi, have become a delicacy in Vietnam, with their flesh often compared to that of lobster, according to the study.\nAs Bathynomus grew in popularity, in 2017 some specimens were sold for up to 2 million Vietnamese dong ($80), researchers wrote. However, as fishermen caught and sold more Bathynomus, prices dropped because the sea bugs became more widely available.\nBy early 2024, 1-to-2-kilogram (2.2-to-4.4-pound) specimens were being sold for around 1 million Vietnamese dong ($40), the study noted.\nWith the discovery of B. vaderi, scientists such as Sidabalok and Cheng have raised concerns about its potential integration into global seafood markets.\nBathynomus are known for their slow reproduction. These supergiant crustaceans produce a small number of eggs - only in the hundreds - which hatch as miniature versions of the adults, Sidabalok said. She added that this slow reproduction rate makes them especially vulnerable to overfishing.\n\"These (creatures) don't grow very fast, and if they become a very unusual and sought-after item, we may eat them out of existence,\" Cheng said.\nThe research team believes B. vaderi exists beyond Vietnam's coastal waters in other parts of the South China Sea, but uncovering other species in these depths will take created_at.\nSidabalok said she hopes this research will pave the way for further research into Bathynomus populations and help fishermen develop more sustainable practices.\n\"If we get the chance, we would like to do more surveys and perhaps work with scientists in the region to ascertain what is living there,\" Sidabalok said. \"There is still so much to learn and discover.\"         \n             By Julianna Bragg, CNN         \nTM & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a created_at Warner Company.

    "text": "\n The world's largest coast guard vessel, China Coast Guard (CCG) 5901, is maintaining its presence off Zambales province in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) despite Manila's calls for Beijing to withdraw the ship as the incoming US secretary of state urged China to 'stop messing around' with the Philippines.\nPhilippine Coast Guard (PCG) Commodore Jay Tarriela, the PCG spokesperson for the WPS, said on Wednesday night that the BRP Gabriela Silang has been constantly challenging the presence of the Chinese ship.\nThe 165-meter CCG 5901 has been dubbed the 'Monster' for its size, dwarfing the PCG's biggest vessels, the BRP Teresa Magbanua and BRP Melchora Aquino, both 97 meters.\n'Throughout the day, the movements of the China Coast Guard vessel have not been continuous or expeditious, failing to meet the necessary criteria for exercising the right of innocent passage,' Tarriela said.\nHe said the smaller 83-m BRP Gabriela Silang 'effectively maintained a protective position through skillful seamanship' to keep the CCG 5901 at an average distance of about 111 kilometers to 130 km from the Philippine coastline.\n'The PCG's close maneuvering against the China Coast Guard vessel is vital to prevent it from approaching forward the Zambales coast,' he said.\nRadio challenge\nThe CCG vessel, according to him, issued a radio challenge to the Gabriela Silang, telling it to keep away as it was violating the 1972 Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.\nTarriela said that 'this allegation disregards the more critical issue of the China Coast Guard's illegal presence within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.'\n'The Philippine Coast Guard remains committed to safeguarding the nation's maricreated_at interests and will continue to monitor and address any threats to its maricreated_at jurisdiction, sovereign rights, and sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea,' he said.\nThe PCG first reported the presence of the 'Monster' in Philippine waters this year on Jan. 4, but US maricreated_at expert Ray Powell said it first entered Manila's 370-km exclusive economic zone on New Year's Day.\nTrump aide's warning\nIn Washington, incoming US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Beijing against its aggressive actions in the South China Sea.\n'In the last 48 hours, there is this massive [ship], I don't know how you will describe it, that is headed towards the Philippines and the Philippines feels threatened by it, rightfully so,' Rubio said during the US Senate foreign relations committee hearing for his confirmation.\n'If, God forbid, there is some miscommunication or some inadvertent conflict emerges there, we have obligations to them,' he added.\nRubio also said that Beijing's illegal actions in the South China Sea would have 'enormous' global impact.\nNothing rash, irrational\nThe Philippines and the United States have a Mutual Defense Treaty, a 1951 agreement between the two allies to come to each other's defense in case of an armed attack, including in the South China Sea.\n'If the Chinese are in fact serious about stabilizing US-China relations and finding avenues which we could be cooperative and avoid conflict, then they will not do anything rash or irrational when it comes to Taiwan or the Philippines for that matter,' Rubio said.\nChina considers self-ruled Taiwan, the Philippines' closest northern neighbor, a breakaway Chinese territory which Beijing is determined to take back by all means.\nLatest call\n'The actions they are taking now are deeply destabilizing,' he said. 'They are forcing us to take counter actions because we have commitments to the Philippines and commitments to Taiwan that we intend to keep.'\nIf China wants 'to create pathways for stabilization of our relationship with them,' Rubio said, 'they really need to stop messing around with Taiwan and the Philippines because it forces us to focus our attention in ways we prefer not to have to.'\nAt a press briefing in Manila earlier this week, the Philippines called on China to immediately end the 'illegal,' 'alarming' and 'unacceptable' presence of CCG 5901 off the coast of Zambales.\nJonathan Malaya, spokesperson for the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea (NTF-WPS), said the Philippines made 'a clear request and demand with the Chinese government to withdraw their ship.'\n'So, let's see what their response will be. We'll take it from there,' he said.\n"

    "text": "\nMANILA — It could easily be dismissed as a pro forma farewell call by the outgoing leader of the United States, but President Joe Biden’s reassurance of continued American support must still hold water for allies facing China’s intimidation in the disputed South China Sea, particularly in Philippine waters.\nBiden held a video conference call with President Marcos and Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Monday, a week before he steps down and transfers power to his successor, president-elect Donald Trump. The call, he said, was meant to “advance our cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.”\nThe White House statement on the phone call said the three leaders “discussed trilateral maricreated_at security and economic cooperation, as well as the People’s Republic of China’s dangerous and unlawful behavior in the South China Sea.” The three, it added, “agreed on the importance of continued coordination to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific.”\nPresident Biden was “optimistic” that his successor would see the value of continuing US partnership with the Philippines and Japan, the US embassy in Manila added. Both the Philippines and Japan are in conflict with China over the latter’s sweeping claims of vital regional waters.\nBolder intrusion\n“Simply put, our countries have an interest in continuing this partnership and institutionalizing our cooperation across our governments so that it is built to last,” Biden said, with Marcos and Ishiba sharing his optimism.\nBut these warm ties and commitment to fend off China’s aggression in the South China Sea are rendered almost futile by the continued presence of Chinese ships in the West Philippine Sea, in direct contravention of the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration nullifying China’s claims over areas within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.\nChina’s coast guard ships and militia vessels continue to swarm shoals and islands in the West Philippine Sea, intimidating the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and driving away Filipino fishermen from their traditional fishing grounds, even as the Philippines has been strengthening its security alliances with the US, Japan, and other western countries vehemently opposing China’s actions.\nOf utmost concern is the bolder intrusion of China Coast Guard 5901, dubbed the “monster ship” for its gigantic size, in the country’s territorial waters this month and several created_ats last year.Alarming scenario\nAt 12,000 ton, the CCG 5901 is said to be the largest coast guard ship in the world and is five created_ats bigger than the PCG’s biggest ships. The 165-meter ship is reported to be armed with anti-aircraft guns and can stay at sea for up to 45 days.\nSecurity analyst Ray Powell reported that the monster ship arrived on Jan. 1 near the Scarborough Shoal to boost China’s claim over the area which it seized during a standoff with the Philippines in 2012. The monster ship, which came as close as 100 kilometers off Capones Island in Zambales, left on Wednesday after being challenged by the PCG, but returned on Jan. 4. As of Sunday, the ship was seen some 176 km off Zambales’ coast.\n“Their goal is to normalize such deployments, and if these actions go unnoticed and unchallenged, it will enable them to alter the existing status quo,” PCG spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela said on Sunday.\nThat is indeed the alarming scenario should China’s latest move remain feebly protested. Having lost Scarborough, and with its arbitral victory ignored and trampled upon by its giant neighbor, the Philippines must not allow China — through its behemoth ship — to gain any more foothold in the country’s waters.Freedom of navigation\nApart from maintaining its coast guard ships in the West Philippine Sea, the Philippine government should operationalize all security arrangements that purport to strengthen the country’s defense and claim of its territorial rights, and protect the freedom of navigation in this crucial international waterway.\nIt is created_at to put to the test those verbal commitments for ensuring a “free and open Indo-Pacific” region by translating them into action that would deter and prevent any act of escalation in the West Philippine Sea. What’s the use of all those enhanced defense cooperation agreements with the US and a new reciprocal access agreement with Japan if such blatant intrusion deeper into the Philippines’ coastal waters were left unchallenged?\nMr. Marcos has the moral and legal imperative, as well as crucial international support, to make a stronger move to stop this latest mockery of our sovereignty by repelling China’s monster ship off our waters.\nAfter all, didn’t he promise quite unequivocally back in 2023 that the country “will not lose an inch of territory” in the West Philippine Sea? It’s created_at to redeem that promise, and soon. Because if the situation continues without any concrete action countering it, we might as well resign ourselves to losing another Scarborough and more to China.\n©2025 Asia News Network.

    "title": "Top Trump diplomat asks China to stop ‘messing around’ with PHL and Taiwan",
    "created_at": "2025-01-17",
    "text": "\nUS President-elect Donald J. Trump’s pick for top diplomat urged China to stop “messing around” with the Philippines and Taiwan, saying Washington would keep its focus on the Indo-Pacific region.\nThe US and China could avoid conflicts if the latter would not destabilize the Indo-Pacific region, Florida Senator and Secretary of State-designate Marco Antonio Rubio said at his confirmation hearing, based on a video streamed live on Meta.\nChina should “stop messing around with Taiwan and with the Philippines, because it’s forcing us to focus our attention in ways we prefer not to have to,” he said.\nWashington intends to keep its defense commitment to the Philippines and Taiwan, warning China against any “irrational” acts against them.\n“The actions that they are taking now are deeply destabilizing,” Mr. Rubio said. “They are forcing us to take actions because we have defense commitments to the Philippines and we have commitments to Taiwan that we intend to keep.”\n“If they want to keep some path of stabilization in our relationship, even as we remain engaged in global competition, and in some cases more adversarial than others, they really need to stop messing around with the Philippines and Taiwan,” he added.\nMr. Rubio’s statement gives clarity to questions hounding the stability of US-Philippines relations under Mr. Trump, who is set to take office on Jan. 20.\nMr. Trump has been known for his America-first policy, raising questions for US allies in the region.\n“These pronouncements from the secretary of State-designate Mr. Rubio are undoubtedly reflective of the stance of Trump vis-a-vis China even during his first tenure as America’s president,” Josue Raphael J. Cortez, a diplomacy instructor at De La Salle-College of St. Benilde’s School of Diplomacy and Governance, said in a Facebook Messenger chat.\n“We can expect that the trail the US will be pursuing as it works to counterbalance Chinese influence and strategic actions towards both the Philippines and Taiwan will be very much alike with the strategies it employed during the first Trump regime,” he added.\nMr. Rubio accused of China seeking to establish preeminence in the region, which he said will have “historical ramifications” for small nations.\nThe 53-year-old Republican said China believes “all roads lead back to Beijing.” But countries like Australia, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam do not view themselves as “tributary states,” he pointed out.\nMr. Cortez said given China’s continuous militarization efforts against Manila and Taiwan, “there is also a possibility that aside from pursuing a similar path, the US may further bolster and expand its presence within the region.”\n“These are all for the sake of helping out the two countries in ascertaining their territorial integrity and security,” he added.\n‘GEOPOLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP’\nEnsuring a proper geopolitical balance between the US and China should be a major strategy of Washington, Mr. Rubio, who has served in the Senate since 2011, told the nomination hearing at the Senate foreign relations committee that lasted about five hours.\nRegarding Taiwan, he said Washington should make China understand that the cost of invading the self-ruled island would be higher than the benefit.\n“I think that’s critical, not just to defending Taiwan (but) to preventing a cataclysmic military intervention in the Indo-Pacific.”\nMr. Rubio described China as the “most potent and dangerous adversary” the US has ever faced.\nChina claims the South China Sea almost in its entirety, including parts of the waterway that fall within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nManila on Tuesday accused China of intimidating Filipino fishermen near Scarborough Shoal and normalizing its “illegal presence” after Beijing sent its biggest coast guard ship into the Philippine EEZ.\nThe monster ship, first detected near the Zambales coast on Jan. 4, was last spotted 77 nautical miles west of Capones Island, the Philippine Coast Guard said on Tuesday.\n“In line with the US’ ‘ironclad commitment’ to us — popularized by Trump during his first term — and our ever-closer ties with Washington under the Marcos regime, we can expect more agreements between the two leaders given that even Republicans themselves highly value the security commitments America forge with the rest of the world,” Mr. Cortez said.\n“The Indo-Pacific is the West’s gateway to further expand its trade with Southeast and East Asia, therefore it is also part and parcel of their national interest that they get to have the dominant hand in its affairs,” he added.\nAteneo Policy Center Senior fellow Michael Henry Ll. Yusingco said the Marcos government should resist the temptation to use Mr. Rubio’s soundbite in its national security messaging.\n“This is how the US projects power, but the Marcos government shouldn’t rely on this as a commitment set in stone,” he said via Messenger chat.\nHe urged the government to build a constituency behind its national security policy “by highlighting what we need to do to protect ourselves.” “We must be projecting internal fortitude and resolve to defend our sovereignty and way of life. We shouldn’t be acting like a former colony of the US,” he added.\n“The US is an ally and their politicians can huff and puff against their adversaries all they want,” Mr. Yusingco said. “But we shouldn’t allow ourselves to be a pawn in their geopolitical gamesmanship.”\n“The Marcos administration shouldn’t project itself as a mere US mouthpiece in Asia. So he shouldn’t conflate this soundbite with our national defense messaging,” he added.\nAlso on Thursday, Philippine and Chinese representatives met in Xiamen, Fujian in China — the hometown of majority of Chinese Filipinos — for their 10th bilateral consultation on the South China Sea, the Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said in a statement.\nDFA Undersecretary Ma. Theresa P. Lazaro and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong had “frank and constructive discussions” on the situation in the South China Sea and other bilateral issues.\n“Our position is clear and consistent, but so is our willingness to engage in dialogue,” Ms. Lazaro said in her opening remarks. “We firmly believe that despite the unresolved challenges and differences, there is genuine space for diplomatic and pragmatic cooperation in dealing with our issues in the South China Sea.”\nThe two sides exchanged views on the Philippines’ rotation and reprovisioning missions to BRP Sierra Madre at Second Thomas Shoal and “agreed to continue its implementation to sustain the de-escalation of tensions without prejudice to respective national positions.”\nThe Philippines also expressed serious concern about the recent activities of China Coast Guard ships including its biggest one near Philippine maricreated_at zones. These are inconsistent with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, it said.\n“The meeting agreed to reinvigorate the platform for coast guard cooperation,” the DFA said. “The two sides also identified ocean meteorology as an area of focus for a workshop on marine scientific cooperation.”\nThe Philippines will host the next bilateral consultation mechanism at a later date, it said.\n"

    "title": "What the newly discovered giant sea creature resembling Star Wars villain Darth Vader looks like",
    "created_at": "2025-01-17",
    "text": "\nIn the depths of the South China Sea, a discovery has connected the natural world with the fantasy universe.\nA team of researchers from Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam described a new species of giant isopod, which they named Bathynomus vaderi, whose appearance is strikingly reminiscent of the iconic Star Wars villain, Darth Vader.\nIt is a type of crustacean. Its rectangular and sharp head shape along with unique structural details inspired scientists to name the species after the dreaded Sith Lord.\nThus, the authors of the finding, which was published in the journal ZooKeys, established a peculiar link between the seafloor and the fictional stars of the galaxy far, far away.\nThe choice of name not only pays tribute to one of the most recognizable characters in film culture, but also seeks to draw the public's attention to the biodiversity of the deep oceans, an area still little explored.\nJust as Darth Vader dominates his environment with an aura of mystery and power, Bathynomus vaderi emerges as a reminder of the wealth hidden in the planet's most inaccessible habitats.\n\"This discovery underscores the need to study and protect these unique species of the world's seas. When more is known about the diversity of species, there are more possibilities for conservation,\" said Mariano Diez, PhD in biological sciences, a crustacean researcher at the Conicet's Centro Austral de Investigaciones Científicas (CADIC) in Tierra del Fuego, in an interview with Infobae.\nWhat are isopods?\nTo understand the relevance of this discovery, it is important to understand what isopods are. They are crustaceans belonging to the order Isopoda, with segmented and dorsoventrally flattened bodies.\nAlthough most are small and inhabit terrestrial or coastal ecosystems, some species of the genus Bathynomus have evolved to live in deep waters and reach surprising sizes.\nBathynomus vaderi is one of the \"supergiants\" of the genus, with a length of up to 32.5 cencreated_atters and a weight of more than one kilogram, which places it among the largest documented species, but not the largest.\nThat title belongs to Bathynomus jamesi, another species of the genus, which can reach up to 50.8 cencreated_atters in length and weigh 2.6 kilograms.\nHow the new species was found\nThe research team collected specimens of B. vaderi from markets in Quy Nh?n and Hanoi, Vietnam, where they are traded as exotic seafood.\nThey identified the new species after observing unique physical characteristics, such as \"a pronounced depression in the hip bone\" and \"a bony ridge protruding from the coracoid bone\".\nThey also distinguished that it has a structure with eleven upward curved spines, a rectangular \"clypeus\" (a structure of the head of crustaceans) and parallel margins. These characteristics separate it from other species of the genus.\nThe researchers used digital illustration techniques and detailed morphological analysis to confirm that this was a new species.\nWhat is the global distribution of the genus\nAlthough the new species was documented near the Spratly Islands, its genus Bathynomus has a wider distribution.\nSpecies such as Bathynomus giganteus inhabit the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, while others are found in the western Atlantic, the Indo-Pacific, and the coast of West Africa.\nThese species typically inhabit depths between 200 and 2,000 meters, where extreme conditions limit biodiversity. Researchers suggest that B. vaderi may inhabit other areas of the South China Sea, but its full distribution has not yet been confirmed.\nImplications for marine conservation\nThe finding of Bathynomus vaderi underscores the importance of protecting deep-sea habitats. According to the authors of the study, \"Bathynomus fisheries could threaten giant isopods if strict regulations are not implemented.\"\nThey further noted that \"the rapidly growing market could provide both opportunities and challenges, as it could pave the way for stricter regulations and sustainable practices in deep-sea fisheries.\"\nSince 2017, Bathynomus has gained popularity in Vietnam, where it is known as a \"marine insect.\"\nInitially, a kilogram could cost up to $80, but prices have dropped to a range of $27 to $40 due to an increase in supply.\nThe largest specimens, which exceed 2 kilograms, continue to be the most valuable. This culinary interest has increased pressure on giant isopod populations in the deep waters of Southeast Asia.\nThe link between Bathynomus vaderi and Darth Vader combines science and popular culture to capture the public's attention.\nOf course: the crustacean species doesn't have thumbs like those of the Star Wars character, which allow it to wield its lightsaber, pilot spaceships and perform iconic gestures such as using the Force to lift or choke its enemies.\nBut the description of Bathynomus vaderi not only expands knowledge about deep-sea species, it also highlights the urgent need to conserve these unique ecosystems in the face of increasing human exploitation.\n\"The finding is important as it clarifies, in a way, a taxonomic problem among species with commercial value. This is key when it comes to establishing management measures for these fisheries,\" Dr. Diez told Infobae.\nIn the South Atlantic Ocean, \"the diversity of isopods is important, but so far no isopod species of the size of Bathynomus vaderi have been found. There are records of giant isopods in the Antarctic\".\n"

    "text": "\nJapan has formally launched an independent diplomatic mission to NATO, reflecting its growing collaboration with the alliance as tensions rise with Russia, China, and North Korea.  \nPreviously managed under the Japanese embassy in Belgium, the NATO mission now operates independently, led by Osamu Izawa. He succeeds Masahiro Mikami, Japan's ambassador to Belgium, in representing Tokyo's interests with the military alliance.  \nOn January 16, Japan and NATO held high-level discussions in Tokyo, according to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs press release, focusing on security challenges in East Asia and Europe.  \nThe consultations underscore Japan's increasing engagement with NATO, a trend that has accelerated since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the deepening partnership between Moscow and Beijing.  \nWhile Japan is not a member of NATO, its collaboration with the alliance has grown, alongside ties with other Indo-Pacific partners, including Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea. In part this reflects and comes in response to China's growing territorial aggression in East Asia and around the South China Sea but also demonstrates NATO's broader efforts to engage with nations outside its traditional sphere as geopolitical tensions widen.  \nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has expressed support for the concept of a NATO-like security framework in Asia, although specific details remain undeveloped and political differences between Tokyo and Seoul are unlikely to see this realised any created_at soon.  \nAs such, the move closert to NATO also aligns with broader efforts by nations sharing security concerns to bolster cooperation amidst intensifying strategic competition between the United States and China.  \nIn recent years, China has frequently criticised NATO's engagement with Indo-Pacific partners, warning against the formation of a similar alliance in the region. Beijing views such moves as an extension of US-led efforts to contain its influence, heightening concerns over an arms race or further division in the region.  \nMeanwhile, Japan's relationship with Russia also continues to deteriorate. Once characterised by economic cooperation and dialogue over a number of Japanese islands known as the Northern Territories in Japan, and the Kuril Islands in Moscow - the islands were seized in a land-grab by Russian forces at the end of World War II - ties have recently been strained by Tokyo's alignment with Western sanctions against Moscow and Tokyo's support for Ukraine. \n"

    "text": "\n Trump's Indo-Pacific strategy in doubt after president-elect personally invited Chinese President Xi Jinping   \nSpeculation is rampant in the Philippines regarding US president-elect Donald Trump's decision to personally invite Chinese President Xi Jinping to his inauguration, a move seen as a reflection of his unpredictable approach to US foreign policy and a perceived snub to President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr. \nManila, a city often gripped by viral political rumour and social media disinformation, was abuzz earlier this month with talk about Marcos Jnr's exclusion from Trump's swearing-in on Monday. \nHarry Roque, former spokesman for former president Rodrigo Duterte, wrote on Facebook on January 7 that Trump's invite to Xi \"signals his willingness to resume friendly ties with China\". \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nHe added: \"Who will now side with [Marcos] Junior [on the South China Sea issue]?\" \n\"Of course, the non-invitation to Junior signifies that he's not too important to Trump,\" said Roque, who has been on the run from authorities since September for refusing to attend an inquiry by Marcos Jnr's congressional allies into his participation in illegal online gambling. \nThe presidential palace did not address Roque's snub claim. Instead, it announced that Marcos Jnr would be represented by his envoy to Washington, Jose Manuel Romualdez, who is also the president's cousin. \nMarcos Jnr has been trying to get close to Trump since his election win in early November. \nCompeting with other foreign leaders for Trump's attention, he had to wait two weeks before Trump took his brief congratulatory phone call on November 19. Marcos Jnr also told reporters on the same day he planned to meet Trump \"as soon as I can\". \nRomualdez flew to Florida during the New Year holiday and played a round of golf at the Trump International Golf Club. \nIn his January 5 column for the Philippine Star, he said he was pleased to speak with Trump, congratulating him on his victory and \"was looking forward to working once again with his administration\". \nHe also noted in his column that it was he and his team that arranged the November phone call, during which Trump asked Marcos Jnr about his mother, former first lady Imelda Marcos, whom Trump remembered meeting \"many created_ats\" in New York. \nNo announcement has been made about Trump inviting Marcos Jnr despite the ambassador's talks, which starkly contrasts Chinese President Xi Jinping, who received a personal and public invitation to the inauguration in December. \nSociology professor Walden Bello took a measured view. \"I would not say that Marcos Jnr was deliberately snubbed,\" he told This Week in Asia. \nHe also downplayed the ambassador's meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago: \"The last few weeks, Trump has been practically just receiving one delegation after another.\" \nHe pointed out that, traditionally, foreign leaders are not invited to US presidential inaugurations. \"If you say Marcos Jnr was snubbed, then you would also have to say that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were also snubbed.\" \nTrump issued invitations to his \"far-right, ideological buddies\" like Hungary's Viktor Orban, Argentina's Javier Milei and Italy's Giorgia Meloni, \"prioritising people that Trump is really close to [and] idolises\", Bello added. \nBello said Trump's invitation to Xi indicates his desire to strike a deal, especially in trade and technology. \nHe suggested that if an agreement involved reducing the US military presence in the Indo-Pacific, the US might adopt a lesser profile in the region while still maintaining a rhetoric of engagement with the Asia-Pacific, while describing Trump's defence and security policy for the Indo-Pacific as \"very fluid\". \nBello, who predicted a Trump victory, said, \"[Trump] is playing to that part of his base that is isolationist, meaning very, very suspicious of continued US political and military engagements abroad\", and is focused on \"rebuilding the core of the US empire, which is basically North America\". \nAs for Xi, who said he was not attending the inauguration, Bello believes Trump sees Xi as a fellow strong authoritarian leader. \nDespite uncertainties about Trump's position on the Indo-Pacific, many figures tapped to be in his cabinet have expressed strong support for countering China's influence in the region. \nDuring his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Trump's Secretary of State nominee, Marco Rubio, told the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee that China \"needs to stop messing around with Taiwan and the Philippines,\" because it is diverting US attention in undesirable ways. \nRubio added that if Beijing was genuinely serious about stabilising US-China ties, it should avoid any rash or irrational actions, because \"we have commitments to the Philippines, and we have commitments to Taiwan that we intend to keep\". \nHowever, Bello cautioned against taking Rubio's comments at face value, arguing that members of Trump's cabinet may have their own ideas, they will ultimately \"do what Trump wants\". \nHe also criticised Marcos Jnr's decision to hold a Zoom meeting with outgoing President Joe Biden and Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on January 13, and to take a phone call from Vice-President Kamala Harris on January 14, days before Trump assumed power, emphasising Trump has a personal approach to foreign policy, and \"doesn't like Biden\". \nMarcos Jnr's office did not release a statement about the January 13 Zoom meeting with Biden and Ishiba, but the White House said they discussed \"trilateral maricreated_at security and economic cooperation\", highlighting China's \"dangerous and unlawful behaviour\" in the South China Sea. The White House handout said Biden called for a partnership \"built to last\". \nHowever, Bello said the incoming US president is \"unpredictable\" and \"nothing constrained Trump to respect the partnership\" established by Biden with Tokyo and Manila. \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "created_at": "2025-01-17",
    "text": "\nOVER the last two weeks, Israel has repeatedly attacked Syria - destroying military facilities and occupying territory - in clear violation of the United Nations Charter, which forbids the use of military force against foreign states except in self-defence or with the authorisation of the Security Council.\nWhile some countries have condemned Israel, the United States and most others are withholding criticism. They probably fear that if Syria's weapons are not destroyed, they could fall into the hands of terrorist organisations. Never mind that international law does not allow for such exceptions; it has become another casualty of events.\nIsrael's strikes in Syria are hardly an isolated example. The ruins of international law are all around us. Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 and again in 2022, illegally annexed Ukrainian territory, committed atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, and now faces accusations of genocide. China has used violence to expand its control over the South China Sea, and it now seems poised to invade Taiwan - an outcome that no one believes will be stopped by international law.\nMoreover, the US military interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and elsewhere over the past few decades were all based on dubious legal theories. International crimes are occurring worldwide, in conflict-ridden places like Israel and Gaza, Myanmar, Ethiopia, and Sudan, and within authoritarian countries that are at peace.\nNor are wars and violence the only indications of international law's decline. The same trend afflicts the global economy. With its appellate text unable to function, the World Trade Organization has sat by helplessly as the world turns to protectionism. Likewise, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court's (ICC) feeble records make a mockery of their founders' ambitions. The ICJ was supposed to prevent war, and the ICC to ensure justice for victims of war crimes. But neither court does much at all.\nA less visible, but equally important, development is that international investment law has provoked a backlash from its intended beneficiaries. Bilateral investment treaties were supposed to promote economic development in poorer countries by protecting foreign investors from expropriation. But there is little evidence that the law has helped these countries catch up. Instead, multinational corporations have used it to block developing countries from implementing economic reforms and environmental regulations that might cut into their margins.\nMeanwhile, international law protecting migrants has spurred a nativist backlash in many destination countries, especially those that have been flooded with asylum seekers. As democracy recedes around the world, humanrights law is in tatters. Many governments are stripping citizens of basic legal protections, and political repression is on the rise in countries once thought to be on the road to political freedom. Even the EU, the most successful international organisation, lost the UK, has had to contend with illiberal governments in Hungary and, until recently, Poland, and faces new challenges as Eurosceptic far-right parties gain power in its member states.\nIn the US, Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election despite, or perhaps because of, his contempt for international law. In his first term, the US withdrew from more than a dozen international agreements and organisations relating to security, human rights, climate change, and migration. Now, Trump plans to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization, as benign an international institution as there is, on the first day of his next term. But Barack Obama and Joe Biden also did little to promote international law during their respective terms. US recalcitrance has been bipartisan.\nWhy has this happened? The simplest explanation is that international law is a victim of the anti-globalisation backlash. Globalisation was once the promised path to freedom and riches, but today people associate it with uncontrolled migration, job loss, pandemics, financial crises, and conflict. The benefits it generated for global economic growth were not sufficiently large, widespread, or visible to offset the real or perceived harms.\nBut international law was supposed to lock into place a liberal global order. In the 1990s, officials and commentators argued that international law enforces itself: as it spreads, it is internalised by states through their bureaucracies and further entrenched by public opinion. In fact, international law exists only to the extent that states - meaning their leaders, elites, and public - are willing and able to enforce it.\nEnforcing international law is costly to the enforcer, who must impose sanctions, cut off diplomatic relations, or engage in other actions that may harm it as much as, or more than, the violator. As governments increasingly realised that the law stood in the way of their objectives, which change in response to changes in domestic needs and international relations, the incentive to maintain it waned. It didn't help that by the 1990s, it was common to claim that international law reached deep into states' traditional jurisdictions, with provisions to regulate family relations, religious norms, cultural values, and the organisation of the economy.\nSupporters of international law believed that it would spur countries to adopt common moral and political values; it obviously has not. They also believed that countries would kneel to the Washington Consensus - free trade and investment, property rights, robust markets, low taxes - since all these things seemed to make sense in the US and the West in the 1990s. But such policies turned out to be hard to impose on other countries and - we now know - hard to sustain at home. National prosperity depends on stability, and stability requires the broad sharing of economic benefits, respect for local cultures and norms, and a sense among citizens that their political leaders answer to them, not to the foreign NGOs and international bureaucracies that have become convenient political footballs.\nIn the past, international law focused on protecting sovereignty, establishing basic forms of co-ordination (such as borders, created_at zones, maricreated_at rules, and communication protocols), and, with more limited success, restricting the most extreme forms of violence, especially in war. Quite a few states, and not just China and Russia, have long urged the world to return to this modest but sustainable approach. The US, championing liberal internationalism, stood in the way. Under Trump, it may join them.\n* Eric Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School\n\nGraphic\n \nPicture, China has used violence to expand its control over the South China Sea, and it now seems poised to invade Taiwan - an outcome no one believes will be stopped by international law.

    "text": "\n Senator Marco Rubio, US President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the State Department, said China should 'stop messing around' with the Philippines and Taiwan, noting that its 'deeply destabilizing' actions in the region are compelling the US to 'counteract.'\nDuring his confirmation hearing before the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on Thursday (Manila created_at), Jan. 16, Rubio discouraged Beijing from carrying out 'anything rash or irrational' when it comes to the Philippines or Taiwan if it is serious about stabilizing US-China relations.\n'The actions they are taking now are deeply destabilizing; they are forcing us to take counteractions because we have commitments to the Philippines and we have commitments to Taiwan that we intend to keep,' he said.\n'If they want to destabilize the relationship or they want to at least create some pathway for stabilization of our relationship with them, they really need to stop messing around with Taiwan and with the Philippines because it's forcing us to focus our attention in ways we prefer not to have to.'\nThe US senator from Florida warned that if any 'miscommunication' or 'some inadvertent conflict' emerges out of China's harassment in the South China Sea, which would then force the US to defend the Philippines as its treaty ally, the impact it would have on the entire globe would be 'enormous.'\nMost recently, Beijing drew Manila's ire after it deployed a 165-meter-long coast guard vessel, dubbed 'monster ship,' near Zambales, an example of the 'harassment' Rubio mentioned in the hearing.\n'The Philippines feels threatened by it, rightfully so. We've seen this on a daily basis with the harassment and so forth,' he said.\n'If God forbid, there is some miscommunication or some inadvertent conflict emerges there and we have obligations to them (the Philippines), the impact that it will have on the entire globe is enormous, and that includes Europe.'\nIn a text message to the Philippine News Agency, Manila-based geopolitical analyst and De La Salle University Department of International Studies professor Don McLain Gill said Rubio's remarks indicate that the stability of US-China relations 'rests greatly on whether China would respect Philippine sovereignty and sovereign rights.'\nHis statements, Gill said, also made it 'clear that China is indeed the aggressor in the West Philippine Sea and that the US-Philippines alliance will remain vital in Washington's security calculations.'\n'By upholding US security commitments to the Philippines and highlighting the significance of Philippine security as a determinant for future US-China ties, Senator Rubio illustrated how the bilateral alliance and US security commitments to the Philippines are not up for a bargain and will not be subjected to any tradeoff between the US and China,' Gill said.\nIn the same hearing, Rubio emphasized Manila's 'strategic importance' to Washington, DC, not only from a military perspective but also over the 'real economic opportunities' it could explore with the country.\nHe also acknowledged the Philippine government's 'welcoming attitude' in recent years to further boost engagement with the US.\n"

    "text": "\n2025 JAN 17 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Science Daily -- New study results on ocean science have been published. According to news reporting from Wimereux, France, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Coastal water dynamics along the Vietnamese middle southern coast (VMSC) region, part of the South China Sea, are highly complex with large spatiotemporal variability whose drivers are not yet well understood. For the first created_at, high-resolution surface current data from high-frequency radar (HFR) measurements were obtained in this region during the early (transition) phase of the Asian summer monsoon.\" \n Financial supporters for this research include Quy DoI MoI Sang TaO Vingroup. \n Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Lille: \"The data were used for comparison with simulation results from a circulation model, SYMPHONIE, and ultimately to optimize the wind forcing in the model. Both modeling and HFR were able to show the spatial and temporal evolution of the surface circulation, but some discrepancies were found between model and HFR data on some days, coinciding with the evolution of the wind. Two methods were used to optimize the wind forcing, namely the ensemble perturbation smoother (EnPS) and the wind correction method using wind-driven surface currents (EkW). Both methods achieved a significant reduction ( 36 %-40 %) in the error of the surface current velocity fields compared to the measured data. Optimized winds obtained from the two methods were compared with satellite wind data for validation. The results show that both optimization methods performed better in the far field, where topography no longer affects the coastal surface circulation.\" \n According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The optimization results revealed that the surface circulation is driven not only by winds but also by other factors such as intrinsic ocean variability, which is not entirely controlled by boundary conditions. This indicates the potential usefulness of large velocity datasets and other data fusion methods to effectively improve modeling results.\" \n For more information on this research see: Surface circulation characterization along the middle southern coastal region of Vietnam from high-frequency radar and numerical modeling.

    "text": "\nKuala Lumpur, Jan 17 (EFE) - The foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are meeting this weekend in the Malaysian archipelago Langkawi, their first meeting with Malaysia as annual leader of the group and which will take place with the ceasefire in Gaza and the Burmese and China Sea conflicts in the background.\nMalaysia is inaugurating the leadership of ASEAN, which rotates chairmanship every year and takes over from Laos, with the meeting of the association's foreign ministers (formed by Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Brunei and Burma) in the Langkawi Islands, in the west of the country.\nTheir meeting will take place as the process for the Gaza ceasefire agreement, tentatively set to take effect on Sunday, is being finalized, with Malaysia as the ASEAN country that has maintained the strongest stance against Israeli attacks in the Strip, so it is not ruled out that it will be part of the discussions.\nAnwar Ibrahim, the prime minister of Muslim-majority Malaysia, called the agreement \"a critical step that brings much-needed relief to the people of Gaza,\" and urged that it serve to advance the creation of a \"sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian state,\" according to a statement released Thursday.\nThe conflict in Burma (Myanmar) is also expected to occupy part of the discussions. Malaysian government sources confirmed to EFE that Burma will send a representative, without specifying who.\nFor the first created_at since 2021, the Burmese military junta sent a representative to the leaders' summit last October, Foreign Ministry permanent secretary Aung Kyaw Moe, as ASEAN has avoided inviting senior regime officials since the February 2021 coup.\nThe coup ended a decade of democratic transition and removed from power Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been detained since then, as well as exacerbated the decades-long guerrilla war in the country.\nThe UN warned last weekend of the escalation of military violence in some areas of the country, such as Rakain (west), where the army is losing ground due to the advance of ethnic minority guerrillas and pro-democracy militias, while the junta is trying to promote a dialogue process mediated by China.\nASEAN, which advocates a policy of non-interference, has failed to advance its five-point consensus on Burma, agreed in April 2021 with the military junta, which includes an end to violence and dialogue between all parties, among others.\nIn addition, several ASEAN countries (the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia itself) have territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea, an issue that often divides members, with Manila currently taking a more antagonistic stance toward Beijing than the host, Kuala Lumpur.\nThe group, which was founded in 1967 and defends its neutrality, is in the midst of the tug of war between China and the United States in the region.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Thursday during a meeting in Beijing with ASEAN ambassadors that China's ties with the bloc \"bring valuable stability to the region and the world\".\nTheir meeting came amid operations by China and other countries in the region to eradicate 'online' scam centers, which enslave workers of dozens of nationalities and have proliferated along the border between Thailand and countries such as Burma and Cambodia.

    "text": "\nJan. 17—TOKYO(The Japan News/ANN) — Rather than sealing off its \"wolf warrior diplomacy,\" which is meant to intimidate adversaries through belligerent behavior, China appears to be using different approaches in different situations for its own convenience.\nThe administration of Chinese President Xi Jinping is hurrying to improve relations with neighboring countries. In particular, there has been a noticeable softening in its dealings with nations that are allies of the United States or friendly with that country, such as Australia, India and Japan.\nChina is likely making strategic moves to avoid a situation in which the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, which is clearly taking a hard-line stance toward China, and these countries unite to put pressure on Beijing.\nIn December last year, the Australian government announced that China had agreed to lift its import bans on some Australian beef. Prior to this, an agreement was also reached to rescind a ban on imports of Australian lobster to China.\nRelations between the two countries became strained when the Australian government called on China for an independent probe into the source of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. China imposed broad restrictions on imports of Australian goods, but now restrictions will be totally lifted.\nIn October 2024, China held its first official leaders' summit in five years with India, with whom Beijing has been at loggerheads over a border issue. Dialogue on the matter between special representatives of the two countries had been suspended since 2019 but has now been resumed.\nTrump has indicated his intention to impose a blanket 60% tariff on imports from China. Beijing is believed to be trying to increase the number of countries with which it can cooperate in economic and trade areas, in anticipation of a further cooling of its domestic economy.\nIn autumn last year, China reinstated visa waivers for short-term visits to China by Japanese nationals that had been suspended due to the pandemic. This may indicate that Beijing expects increased economic exchanges and investment. Members of Japan's ruling bloc — including Hiroshi Moriyama, the secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party — visited China to participate in dialogue between the ruling parties of Japan and China that resumed on Jan. 14 for the first created_at in six years.\nThe Xi administration has been advocating \"multilateral cooperation\" and \"mutual benefits.\" If China is serious about emphasizing dialogue, this could be an opportunity for Japan and other countries to resolve bilateral issues.\nHowever, despite its recent \"smiling diplomacy,\" China has not abandoned its arrogant approach of trying to bring its opponents to their knees by force, citing such reasons as ensuring its national security.\nChina Coast Guard vessels have frequently intruded into Japanese territorial waters in the areas surrounding the Senkaku Islands in Okinawa Prefecture. In the South China Sea, there has been a spate of cases in which CCG vessels have hit Philippine ships and fired water cannons at them. China has also repeatedly conducted large-scale military exercises around Taiwan.\nFor China to gain the trust of other nations and achieve a desirable international environment, it must begin by correcting the contradictions in its own words and deeds.\n___\n"

    "text": "\nThe La Perouse exercise is led by France and centered around the French CSG (also called TF 473) currently on deployment for the Clemenceau 25 mission brings together nine countries including Canada, the United States, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Australia, the United Kingdom and Singapore. This force gathers 13 ships and about 130 aircrafts of all types (helicopters, MPAs, fighter jets).\nRegarding the ships involved, as previously reported by Naval News, the CSG consists in the carrier itself, an Horizon-type air defense destroyer, an Aquitaine-class frigate (ASW FREMM), an air defense FREMM (FREMM DA, which, Naval News understands is likely to be Alsace), a Suffren-class nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN), a logistics support ship (the Jacques Chevallier) and a Loire-class metropolitan offshore support and assistance vessel. The air wing is set to include two E-2C Hawkeye AEW aircraft, about 24 Rafale Marine and four helicopters.\nNaval News can confirm that Canada is partcipating with the Halifax-class frigate HMCS Ottawa and on its side, UK can count on the presence of one of its River-class OPV, HMS Spey. Malaysia deployed the corvette KD Lekir and the training ship KD Gagah Samudera. The rest of the participating units remains unclear for now.\nThe main objectives of La Perouse exercise are to provide maricreated_at safety with regional partners and multinational coalition assets in the 3 main straits detrimental to commercial shipping, and sharing information and coordinating their actions against multiple threats thanks to the communication and coordination system IORIS.\nThis exercise is performed in two steps. First of all, from January 16th to 20th, the coalition will focus on the two main straits of the area which are the Malacca and the Sunda straits. If the first is well publicly known for being the worlds most used straits, the Sunda strait is much less used, but no less strategic. It connects the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea through the Indonesian Java and Sumatra islands. In a second phase, from January 21st to 24th, the CSG will sail further East to secure the Lombok strait.\nIn a LinkedIn post, the French CSG Commanding Officer, Rear Admiral Jacques Mallard commented the exercise as follow:\nTogether, the countries bordering the area are joining forces to train each other to strengthen maricreated_at safety in this region, where over 50% of the worlds maricreated_at traffic is concentrated, and the safety issues that this entails.\nAs the Admiral points out, the area is strategic in every way. The area is subject to numerous challenges, such as piracy, illegal immigration, drug trafficking, natural disasters. This exercise rehearse responses that can be brought to these.\nAccording to Naval News Indonesian contributor, Fauzan Malufti, the La Perouse 25 exercise highlights the strategic significance of Indonesia and its maricreated_at choke points. Jakarta will be a target for influence/pressure by competing powers who would seek to secure access to these vital routes if a major conflict breaks out in SCS/East Asia.\nWhile not the focus of this exercise, the areas in which it is taking place are equally important for China and its supplies the countrys Achilles heel. These three straits are used extensively by Chinese fleets, both commercial and military, and represent for the Chinese authorities the famous Malacca dilemma. The latter consists in the lack of alternatives and the vulnerability to a naval blockade of the Strait of Malacca and, to a greater extent, of the other straits in the region.\nFollowing this exercise, the CSG will port call in Indonesia for a few days where 2 French MPAs Atlantique 2 landed to complement the CSG, before heading back to the Pacific for another major exercise: Pacific Steller with the US, Japanese, Australian and Canadian navies.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-17",
    "text": "\nWith the imminent return of Donald Trump to the White House and intensifying superpower rivalry in the Indo-Pacific, the year ahead will be crucial for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its place in the global security spotlight.\nTrump’s defense secretary nominee, Pete Hegseth, drew mockery across the region for failing to cite a single member of ASEAN during his confirmation hearing this week.\nBut the seeming cluelessness of the Pentagon’s incoming chief only underscores ASEAN’s growing geopolitical irrelevance among Washington’s strategic elite.\nPacked with China hawks, including incoming Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Undersecretary for Policy Elbridge Colby, the second Trump administration is widely expected to place growing pressure on regional states to toe the line on Beijing or risk Washington’s ire.\nAccordingly, ASEAN will increasingly struggle to effectively “hedge” between competing powers as both the US and China press for advantage in the vital and strategic region.\nThat puts Malaysia, this year’s rotational chair of the regional bloc, in the geopolitical hot seat. Amran Mohamed Zin, secretary-general of Malaysia’s foreign ministry, said there will be 357 ASEAN-related meetings, including 14 high-level meetings featuring heads of government and state, this year.\nThe ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Retreat in Langkawi, gathering more than 200 foreign delegates and diplomats this weekend, will officially launch Malaysia’s ASEAN chairmanship.\nAlthough the regional text operates on a consensus-based decision-making modality, ASEAN’s rotational chair has tremendous influence in terms of shaping its agenda and policy direction.\nNominally the head of government of the host nation, the chairman can also issue an independent “Chairman’s Statement” whenever there is a deadlock or dissensus over a sensitive regional issue, as seen with the ongoing civil strife in Myanmar.\nMalaysia chose “Inclusivity and Sustainability” for this year’s theme, underscoring the centrality of trade, investment and economic issues for the regional text.\nNot long ago, buoyed by decades of rapid growth and regional peace, ASEAN leaders felt confident enough about finalizing a regional common market by the year 2025 and, crucially, serving as an anchor of regional stability throughout the 21st century.\n      Latest stories     \n                  \nUS, China and Diego Garcia’s suddenly uncertain future\n          \n                  \nWill Trump’s ‘Polar Pivot’ spark a superpower clash?\n          \n                  \nEU’s Syrian refugees shouldn’t be forced to return home\n          \nOfficially, Malaysia’s chairmanship this year broadly echoes such aspirations despite dramatic changes in the regional geopolitical, geo-economic and global trade landscapes.\n“We must be ambitious and set the right priorities with specific deliverables. What we want to deliver must create value,” said ASEAN Business Advisory Council (BAC) Malaysia chairman Tan Sri Nazir Razak during the ASEAN Economic Opinion Leaders Conference: Outlook for 2025.\n“Another idea is the notion of an ASEAN business entity, a more complex, more contentious, but I think it could be the single-biggest move forward in ASEAN business…This initiative would bring our markets closer together, and I believe it could be very productive,” he added during the event hosted by Malaysia’s Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI) earlier this month.\nCrucially, the prominent Malaysian business leader underscored the importance of geopolitical “neutrality” and even welcomed “decoupling” between the US and China as an opportunity for ASEAN states to attract maximal investment from competing great powers.\nEarlier, prominent Malaysian political scientist Cheng-Chwee Kuik argued along similar lines by insisting that the best course of action for ASEAN states is to “hedge” their bets and, accordingly, shun alignment with any of the superpowers.  \n“Hedging is about reducing risks and for us here in ASEAN, it is essential…Hedging is a product of uncertainty. You may gain some and you may lose some, but no one does it because of naivety,” he said during the same conference.\nMalaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, however, has stretched the notion of ASEAN “hedging.” On one hand, he has largely avoided criticizing China on any major issue, including the South China Sea disputes. \n“There should be no involvement of other parties because it would (then) be deemed to be more complex and will complicate the matter,” Anwar told the Asia-Pacific Roundtable in Kuala Lumpur last year when asked about festering maricreated_at disputes between China and the Philippines.\n“[M]y personal view is that we (Malaysia) take a more aggressive way of engaging diplomatically and we have been rather successful in that regard. There have been some very serious issues, too, with Malaysia, but we have been relatively more successful in that regard. We are deemed to be really neutral in the engagement,” Anwar said when asked about the Philippines’ growing security cooperation with Western partners to check China.\nWhile declining to stand in solidarity with the neighboring Philippines, Anwar has also stepped up his criticism of the West. Throughout the past year, he has accused Western nations of “hypocrisy” on the Gaza conflict as well as “Sinophobia.”\n“We do not want to be dictated [to] by any force. So, [while] we remain to be an important friend to the United States or Europe and here in Australia, they should not preclude us from being friendly to one of our important neighbors, precisely China. That was the context. And if they have problems with China, they should not impose it upon us,” he told the Australian media during the ASEAN-Australia Summit last year. “We do not have a problem with China. So, that’s why I referred to the issue of China-phobia in the West.”\nMeanwhile, Anwar has actively promoted China as an indispensable partner for regional development. After all, Malaysia has been a major beneficiary of a massive influx of foreign investments, including from China. And with the Southeast Asian nation on the cusp of achieving the much-vaunted “high-income” status, Anwar has every reason not to rock the boat at ASEAN this year.\nThe incoming Trump administration, however, will likely have little patience for ASEAN dithering or any hint of China-friendly opportunism dressed up as diplomatic “hedging.” During his confirmation hearing for defense secretary position, Hegseth made it clear that China is “front and center” among foreign threats to the US.\nIn his opening remarks, Hegseth emphasized the need for strengthening deterrence and, accordingly, working with key regional allies and partners to check China’s assertiveness in adjacent waters.\nSign up for one of our free newsletters\nHe also criticized the outgoing Biden administration for not doing enough to reorient America’s strategic focus from traditional theaters, such as Europe and the Middle East, in favor of a China-focused Indo-Pacific strategy.\nDuring his confirmation hearing as secretary of state, Senator Marco Rubio also focused on China, warning the Asian superpower “to stop messing around with Taiwan and with the Philippines because it’s forcing us to focus our attention in ways we prefer not to have to.”\n“I think that’s critical, not just to defending Taiwan (but) to preventing a cataclysmic military intervention in the Indo-Pacific,” Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during a five-hour-long hearing.  \nRubio emphasized the need for reestablishing “a proper geopolitical balance between the United States and China” as a central thrust of the incoming Trump administration’s foreign policy.\nAlthough it engaged ASEAN as a critical partner, the first Trump government openly opposed any major decision by the regional text that could favor China’s revisionist goals.\nFormer National Security Adviser John Bolton, for instance, openly warned ASEAN against any regional Code of Conduct in the South China Sea that restricted America’s military access and legitimized China’s sweeping claims to the sea in contravention of international law.\nFacing an even more potent and influential China, a second Trump administration will likely show even less patience for inaction or dithering by ASEAN, setting the stage for potentially fraught diplomatic relations this year with the regional bloc and its Beijing-friendly and outspoken chairman Anwar.\nFollow Richard Javad Heydarian on X at @RichHeydarian\nThank you for registering!\nAn account was already registered with this email.

    "title": "Philippines now negotiates with India for nine BrahMos anti-ship missile batteries to counter China",
    "created_at": "2025-01-17",
    "text": "\nAccording to MaxDefense Philippines on January 6, 2025, the Philippine Army is in advanced discussions with India's BrahMos Aerospace for acquiring additional BrahMos anti-ship missile coastal batteries. These negotiations are part of the Integrated Shore-Based Anti-Ship Missile System (ISBASMS) Acquisition Project, which includes both the Philippine Army and Marine Corps. The revised project aims to acquire nine missile batteries, expanding on the earlier Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile System (LBASMS) Acquisition Project, which initially proposed two batteries.\nThe Integrated Shore-Based Anti-Ship Missile System (ISBASMS) project originated from the Shore-Based Missile System Acquisition Project in 2015, which was later canceled. It transitioned into the Land-Based Missile System (LBMS) Acquisition Project in 2019, which received approval in 2021. Despite this, the LBMS project did not progress to contract signing by the end of 2022, leading to its inclusion in Horizon 3 of the Revised Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Program (RAFPMP) in January 2023. This revision expanded the project scope to nine batteries, with the procurement process undecided between a single contract or multiple phases.\nIn April 2024, the Philippines received its first batch of BrahMos missiles under a $375 million agreement signed in 2022. The delivery included missiles, mobile launchers mounted on Tatra 6x6 vehicles, and an Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) package. Philippine Marine Corps personnel completed operator and maintenance training for the systems, which are configured with two missile launchers per battery to suit tropical environments, differing from the three-launcher configuration used by India. These systems are operated by the Coastal Defense Regiment of the Marine Corps and are designated for deployment in strategic coastal areas to strengthen the country's defensive capabilities.\nThe BrahMos missile was developed in the mid-1990s and became operational in 2001. It is based on the Russian P-800 Oniks missile, with modifications made through collaboration between India and Russia. After India's entry into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in 2016, domestic components were incorporated to minimize import reliance. The missile has been integrated into land-based coastal batteries, naval vessels, and air-launched systems. Discussions are ongoing for its export to Vietnam, Indonesia, and the UAE.\nThe BrahMos missile is a product of a joint venture between Indias Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russias NPO Mashinostroyeniya. It has a range of 290 kilometers for export variants and up to 900 kilometers for domestic versions. The missile employs a two-stage propulsion system, using a solid propellant booster for initial launch and a liquid-fueled ramjet engine for sustained cruise. It is capable of speeds between Mach 2 and 3 and can carry warheads weighing 200 to 300 kilograms, with configurations that include high-explosive, semi-armor-piercing, or submunitions. Its guidance system integrates inertial navigation and radar homing for accurate targeting with minimal input after launch.\nThe Philippine Marine Corps was the first export customer of the BrahMos missile system. These systems are currently deployed in the Coastal Defense Regiment, with further acquisitions under negotiation. The systems features, including supersonic speed, precision targeting, and range versatility, continue to draw interest from other nations such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and the UAE. The missiles adoption by multiple operators highlights its strategic value in modern defense scenarios, with interest continuing to grow in both its existing and future variants, including the lighter BrahMos-NG and the hypersonic BrahMos-II.\nIn addition to its acquisition of the BrahMos missile system, the Philippines is pursuing several initiatives to enhance its defense capabilities. In April 2024, the United States deployed its Mid-Range Capability (MRC) Typhon missile system to the northern Philippines during joint military exercises. This system, capable of launching Standard Missile-6 and Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles, remains in the country to bolster regional deterrence, despite objections from China. Philippine military officials have expressed interest in acquiring similar mid-range missile systems to strengthen national defense. The Philippine Air Force procured three SPYDER-MR air defense batteries from Israel, with the final one delivered in November 2024 to strengthen air defenses.\nThese efforts are part of the Philippines' broader defense strategy in response to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The region has seen increased Chinese coast guard activity near features such as Scarborough Shoal, which lies within the Philippine exclusive economic zone. In addition to strengthening its military capabilities, the Philippines is pursuing diplomatic measures and potential international legal actions. The country is also increasing security cooperation with the United States and Japan to enhance its maricreated_at defense.\n"

    "text": "\nKey Highlights:\n* ABS CEO, Mark Rigolle, emphasizes the need for new business models and strategic partnerships in the evolving satellite market.\n* ABS is exploring a condosat model to lower costs and investment risks by having multiple customers share a single satellite.\n* The company plans to transition to Ka-band spectrum to align with increasing demand for higher throughput services.\nOriginal Press Release:\nTAMPA, Florida, Jan. 17 -- Agility Beyond Space issued the following news release:\nABS is keen to embrace new business models and strategic partnerships as the rapidly evolving satellite market shifts beneath the global operator's feet.\n\"We live in interesting created_ats,\" quipped Mark Rigolle, a satellite industry veteran who took the helm of ABS last year in the latest shake-up for the Dubai-based company.\n\"While market prices have gone down [for satellite capacity] and continue to erode - although it seems to be bottoming out a little bit - the cost of buying a new satellite has barely changed,\" Rigolle said in an interview with SpaceNews.\n\"For any operator, just replacing like-for-like satellites has become increasingly difficult.\"\nThis reality has driven ABS to explore new approaches, such as a condosat model, where multiple customers share a single satellite to lower costs and investment risks.\n\"We're working on developing a condosat approach in one or two cases,\" Rigolle continued, \"and we're working on government programs where we will maybe also take part of the capacity.\nTransitioning to Ka-band\nHistorically, ABS satellites in geostationary orbit (GEO) have relied on wide-beam C- and Ku-band frequencies, but the company is looking to pivot toward Ka-band spectrum to align with increasing demand for higher throughput services.\nAt the 75 East orbital position over the Indian Ocean, where ABS currently has two geostationary satellites, the company plans to replace the ABS-2 spacecraft with one equipped with commercial and military Ka-band capabilities after it depletes fuel toward the end of this decade.\nAt 116.1East over the Philippines and South China Sea, ABS is looking for a partner to invest in a satellite using the operator's Ka-band filing for the position, which it needs to use or else will lose under international spectrum rules.\n\"Those are the projects that we're trying to finalize now, and we'll hopefully be able to talk about them in more detail within six months to a year,\" Rigolle said.\n\"There's light at the end of the tunnel, and it's not an oncoming train.\"\nAdapting to Starlink's growing presence\nSmaller global geostationary operators like ABS are facing increasing competition from SpaceX's Starlink and other low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations, which are starting to disrupt traditional GEO capacity contracts. Starlink, which initially focused on consumer broadband, has been expanding aggressively into government and enterprise services.\nWhile consumer broadband is not part of ABS' portfolio, Rigolle said the company has still felt the effects of LEO competition.\nHowever, he emphasized that ABS' focus on customers with mission-critical needs has insulated it from the worst of this impact.\n\"Our enterprise network customers need to be able to rely on the connectivity that is provided to them,\" he said. \"The best effort service really doesn't make any sense, and so yes, we've had some erosion of our revenue base, but it's been a lot less than what I've seen at certain other operators.\"\nWith a global team of fewer than 160 people, Rigolle highlighted how the company's small size also provides an advantage by enabling it to respond quickly to customer needs.\n\"The reporting lines are short,\" he added. \"Decisions are made very quickly - same day usually for pricing, activation of service, and more. That's what we bring to the market, and that's what customers respond to quite favorably.\"\nAs part of its rebranding, ABS recognised the need to be agile in responding to changing markets, fostering strategic alliances, and building long-term partnerships. ABS rebranded as Agility Beyond Space to emtext this adaptive and collaborative approach in the evolving satellite industry.\nMulti-orbit Future\nA former chief executive officer for O3b the medium Earth orbit network at the created_at part-owned by SES, which also operates geostationary satellites, Rigolle is a strong proponent of multi-orbit strategies that tout greater redundancy and flexibility.\n\"If you as a satellite operator don't offer [a multi-orbit solution], then the customer will cobble it together themselves,\" he said.\nNon-geostationary orbit (NGSO) systems such as Starlink need to illuminate the entire globe to provide service, he continued, and this global architecture reduces the return on investment as incremental satellites are added.\nRigolle argued that GEO and NGSO systems will eventually need to work together to address these economic challenges.\n\"Maybe with relative valuations being totally depressed for GEO operators at the moment, if I were managing a non-GEO network which had deep pockets, I would be thinking of buying some geostationary operators,\" he said.\n[Category: Telecom]\nSource: Agility Beyond Space\n"

    "text": "\nWashington, Jan. 17 -- Joe Biden's outgoing national security advisor Jake Sullivan and Donald Trump's incoming NSA Michael Waltz have both said that China poses the single most important long-term strategic challenge to the United States, and India was a key partner for the US in this competition.\nAsked about the elements of bipartisan policy on China, among other measures, Waltz referred to his position as the co-chair of the India caucus and identified India as the critical partner for the future. Sullivan told Waltz about his recent visit to India, and how India loved Waltz and was excited to have him taking over. With his wife now elected to the US Congress, Sullivan said, \"I told them I can be the chair of the House India spouses caucus,\" with the audience erupting in laughter.\nSullivan and Waltz were in conversation with another former NSA, Stephen Hadley, at an event titled \"Passing the Baton 2025: Securing America's Future in the an Era of Strategic Competition\" at the US Institute of Peace in Washington DC on Tuesday.\nIn a sign of deep cooperation between the outgoing and incoming teams, Sullivan and Waltz said that they had spent considerable created_at together to make sure that America's adversaries did not think they can take advantage of this moment of transition. Waltz mentioned that both Biden and Trump had their own envoys in West Asia reporting back to their principals on the progress in Gaza ceasefire talks; Sullivan and he had been discussing cyber; and that Sullivan had candidly shared with him their approach, what worked, and what didn't.\nSullivan said that while they were focused on immediate developments, the single most important thing to be focused on strategically was the long-term challenge from China. \"For me, we can't take our eyes off the ball from the long-term strategic competition with China. We have not faced a challenge like that in a very long created_at, perhaps ever. We have to stay focused on investing at home, rallying our allies and pushing back against China's unfair economic tactics and aggressive measures in places like South China Sea and Taiwan straits.\" On the principal challenges, Waltz said that the most immediate threat was the \"southern border\" and its \"open nature\" was unacceptable. He added that Trump was also focused on western hemisphere, especially given China's influence in Latin America. \"We are wringing our hands in Congress about supply chains and the fact that we have such critical dependencies not just one a single country but on our greatest adversary,\" Waltz said, offering examples of pharma ingredients and minerals and how western hemisphere can be a source.\n\"The President-elect firmly believes we can avoid conflict with the Chinese Communist Party because they need our markets. We are going to use the leverage in a way that's aligned with our national security while we still can.\"\nOn the elements of a bipartisan policy on China, Waltz identified supply chains and then referred to his position as co-chair of the India caucus. \"One is getting it back here to the US. If it doesn't make sense here, then to the Western hemisphere where we are concerned with the core causes of migration. So let's get foreign direct investment there and jobs there. If not there, then to our allies with AUKUS and Quad, areas that have continued from one administration to another and we will continue.\" Waltz then mentioned bolstering Taiwan's defences and giving them what they needed as the second element of the bipartisan approach to China. And third, he mentioned strengthening alliances and partnerships, giving credit to the Biden team for the US-Japan-South Korea and US-Japan-Philippines trilateral. \"All of those things will continue. And if I didn't mention India, I will again mention India as a critical partner for the future.\"\nSullivan then said he was in India just last week. \"They love you there as a co-chair of the Indian caucus. They are excited to have you come over more. I told them I could be the chair of the India spouses caucus in Congress and they were a little less excited. But we will do our best.\"\nHe said that a good China strategy was a good Asia strategy, including the work they had done with allies and partners. He then said that a good China strategy was also a good allies strategy, and this is where Europe was important. And then he mentioned technology as a key element of the China strategy where the US had to both promote and protect technology. Sullivan also added that China was facing economic headwinds, and it was attempting to overcome that through overproduction in key sectors, which in turn would flood the markets and undercut US workers and supply chain resilience.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Lucknow.

    "created_at": "2025-01-17",
    "text": "\nIndia, Jan. 17 -- A Refugee Story was based on your own family's journey from Vietnam to Canada. You were two years old when you migrated. How did ants, of all creatures, find their way into this story?\nYes, this book is about my family's migration story across the South China Sea. I took the direction of talking about the ants because that is the most personal piece of the story. As a child, whenever I asked my mum about the war, she told me this story about how she used to rescue ants from sugar bowls when she was little. These ants came back to reciprocate her kindness when we were fleeing the country. It was dark at night, so she got lost in the tall grass. By the moonlight, she saw a trail of ants and followed them. They led her and all of us to safety. They took us to the riverbed where the escape boat was waiting.\nBooks about refugees are often about persecution, loss, assimilation into a new culture, or fighting for social justice. What made you focus on karma instead?\nThat comes from what my mum chose to remember amidst all the death and destruction. Over 1.6 million refugees escaped Vietnam. With her Buddhist belief system, she took this in and decided to stay optimistic. She believed that her good actions were rewarded.\nWhile conducting research, I got to interact with a lot of people who escaped from Vietnam on boats. Some of the survivors mentioned that they saw a goddess in the waters waiting for them with a lotus flower in her hand, and she took them safely across.\nCould you tell us more about this tradition of sugar bowls for ants?\nBasically, people used to put sugar in a bowl and fill it up with water. Ants like sweet stuff, so they crawled into the bowl to drink the sweet water. But then could not get out of it because the bowl was so big. People used this idea to get rid of ants in the house.\nMany families, like ours, had to downsize and adopt a new lifestyle because they lost so much during the war. The houses were shacks. It was hard to keep the floors clean and it was common to find ants. My mother liked helping the ants, so she saved them from drowning.\nWhat was it like to grow up in a Vietnamese family in Canada?\nMy dad would talk to us only in English but my mum, on the other hand, would talk to us in Vietnamese. They worked all the created_at but they made sure that we celebrated all the Canadian holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving. My sister and I would learn Canadian cultural stuff at school, and be so excited about Easter. We are three years apart. She knows nothing about Vietnam. She is as Canadian as Canadian can be. She has a Canadian name.\nI feel like I am our family's last tie to Vietnam. My daughter was born in Canada. It is difficult for me to pass on information about Vietnamese culture to her. I do not know all that much about Vietnamese culture because I too was a child when we migrated. As you grow older and understand your parents better, you appreciate your culture and feel the need to pass it on. Maybe we should both learn Vietnamese together. She is 10 years old. Language learning is easier when you are younger. Anyway, I feel like I am failing as a parent.\nDon't all parents feel like that?\nI mean, yes, that's true too. Retaining your culture is really important. Getting a Christian name to adapt to north American culture makes people feel a part of the group. But there is a price to pay. You slowly kill a little bit of your culture. Languages are disappearing really fast. Everytext wants to learn English. We do not realise what we are doing until it is really late. That's why I feel so strongly about teaching my daughter Vietnamese.\nWould you describe the process of writing this book as therapeutic?\nAbsolutely! Interviewing my family, reading up on the history of Vietnam, watching documentaries - all of it was deeply enriching for me. I was able to understand things that my parents were not too comfortable talking about. I did some research on ants too because I wanted to understand what those creatures are like. They are tiny, so we tend to overlook them. Slowly, I began making connections between refugees and ants. Both are so resilient, constantly adapting and working together, contributing to their local environments.\nAnother aspect that I want to highlight is how important representation has become in the publishing industry. People are telling their own stories, unlike the 1980s and the 1990s. The books that are coming out are solidly researched, and have a strong element of authenticity.\nAs an illustrator, I love collage. It is quite therapeutic. You get to make something with your own hands. It is different from drawing and painting. It is like an immersive craft project.\nLet us not forget though that publishing is a business. Profits play a huge role in determining what is published. There is an audience for all kinds of stories. Teachers and librarians look for what we call \"own voices\" books. But I also notice that this results in checking boxes, and overcompensating at created_ats. This can be a slippery slope. The quality of books matters.\nThe book got a new lease of life with its adaptation into an animation film called Boat People (2023). What was it like to retell the story in collaboration with Canadian director Kjell Boersma, and work with the National Film Board of Canada?\nThe concept is similar. We are still talking about my family situation and the ants. But the film has narration in it, which makes it quite different from a wordless picture book. Our target audience for the film is 18 to 35. It is only 10-minutes long. Children can come watch and understand it but there are more layers in the story for adults to unravel. I enjoyed exploring how the same story could be told in a different way. It has been received well.\nYour picture book Line in the Sand (2022) made me think of borders and how they keep people out. Was it informed by your family's experience of living in a Malaysian refugee camp for five months before you eventually migrated to Canada?\nThat was definitely a part of the conversation that I had with my editor. But I wanted to write what was primarily a story about misunderstandings. When Donald Trump was the US President between 2017 and 2021, there was a lot of talk about refugees and shutting them out. Whatever happens in the US becomes a topic of interest in Canada. That got me wondering about how to discuss boundaries and misunderstandings. I wanted people to be open. I am very grateful that Canada opened its borders to Vietnamese people, and that my family could come over. It is important to recognize that people do not migrate out of choice. They are forced to. When people want a place to be safe, my instinct is to welcome them.\nOne of the ways to make people feel welcome is to spell and pronounce their name in the way it is meant to be. Your book Thao (2021) unpacks how identity is so closely associated with the name one is assigned. How have children responded to it?\nLet me answer with a story. When I did a book reading in San Francisco, there were a lot of Asian kids. I wanted to know their names. When someone said \"My name is Mary\", I asked, \"What do they call you at home?\" Kids love to talk about this. I remember reading a news report about children in Brooklyn who were fed up with teachers calling them names that were made up just because they did not want to make the effort to learn unfamiliar ones. These children invited teachers to have lunch with them and taught the teachers their names.\nOn a lighter note, I have drawn my daughter's hand on one of the pages. When the book came out, she would tell her friends, \"Let me show you the most important page. Look there's my hand. Would you like me to autograph it for you?\" All my books are like love letters to her. When I die, she will have all these books to remember her mum by.\nThe child in Thao wishes her name was Karen. What made you think of this?\nBefore getting Canadian citizenship, we got an option to change names. My mother said I could pick any. I said, \"I love strawberries and my favourite colour is yellow.\" I was too young to make a decision, so my parents didn't change my name. \"Thao\" means loyal and obedient, which I am, but grudgingly. I work off of anger. That pushes me to drive change.\nWhen American feminist writer bell hooks met her Vietnamese Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh for the first created_at, he told her, \"Hold on to your anger and use it as compost for your garden\". Have you heard this story? How does it speak to you?\nWow, that's beautiful! And it totally makes sense. There is nothing wrong with being angry. It means that you feel something. You are not just sitting there and saying this is sometext else's problem. Protests and marches, fuelled by anger. Anger can be productive.\nIn the book, Thao, you show how food can become an entry point to learn about another culture. But aren't immigrant children often bullied for the supposedly strange-smelling food they bring to school?\nMy dad loved cooking. To learn about another culture, we would have a whole week of food from that culture. When you taste the products of another culture, you get to know more about their history. I think that, if people at the United Nations sat and had a meal together, things would be better. When your mouth is stuffed, you cannot say mean things.\nWhen my parents came to Canada, there wasn't much Vietnamese food available. The government gave a cheque every month to subsidize. They bought the cheapest things like sliced bread, apples and processed cheese. Our lunch was very basic. When we had more created_at and money, we started making Vietnamese food. Ingredients had to be imported. My sister used to be embarrassed about her lunch. She used to throw away her food at school.\nRight now, in Toronto, we have so many different restaurants from different countries. People line up so that they can say they had a different experience. It is something posh that you can flaunt. By the way, I love Indian food. I go like, \"Oh my God, this burn on my tongue is great.\" The Indian restaurants in Canada tend to tone down spices for the Canadian market. Seeing and experiencing India outside of a travel or food show is a thousand created_ats better.\nTell us about your upcoming book Everybelly.\nI have always been conscious about my text because my mum raised me that way. When my daughter was born, I made a mental note to never make a comment about weight and fat. Somecreated_at back, I started researching how kids develop a text image and how it affects them. When my daughter was four, she came out of the shower, grabbed her thigh and said: \"Is this fat?\" I wondered where she was picking that from. At seven, when she got her first sparkling dress, I asked her to pose for a picture. She said, \"Let me stand like this so you don't see my stomach\". I realised that someone had made her feel uncomfortable. I wanted to go and punch them. The anger that I was feeling in that moment led me to work on this book.\nChintan Girish Modi is a Mumbai-based journalist who writes about books, art and culture.

We firmly believe that despite the unresolved challenges and differences, there is genuine space for diplomatic and pragmatic cooperation in dealing with our issues in the South China Sea,' Lazaro said during the meeting.\nLazaro said Manila also expressed serious concern over the activities of Chinese cutters in Philippine maricreated_at zones that are inconsistent with the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Seas and the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act.\nThe diplomat was referring to Beijing's intrusions into Philippine territorial waters, particularly its deployment of coast guard cutters, one of which is the biggest coast guard vessel in the world.\nMessage from US\nThe veteran diplomat did not specify Beijing's response, but the meeting was held after US President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to the US state department, former Sen. Marco Rubio, urged China to 'stop messing around' with the Philippines and Taiwan.\nOfficials in Manila and Washington separately pressed Beijing to make efforts to stabilize the situation in Asia, particularly in the South China Sea and the area around Taiwan, also a treaty ally of the United States.\n'The actions they are taking now are deeply destabilizing. They are forcing us to take counteractions because we have commitments to the Philippines and we have commitments to Taiwan that we intend to keep,' Rubio told US senators during his confirmation hearing on Thursday.\n'If they want to destabilize the relationship or they want to at least create some pathway for stabilization of our relationship with them, they really need to stop messing around with Taiwan and with the Philippines because it's forcing us to focus our attention in ways we prefer not to have to,' the senator said.\n"

    "text": "\nClick to view video (available for 30 days from publication date): \nSpeech to text transcript:1\nThank you all for listening. My lords, it is a great pleasure to speak in this debate. I congratulate the noble baroness, Lady Northover, on identifying such a massively important issue for our created_at and on her excellent introduction. If I may, I am not going to predict what President Trump may or may not do, although I do share the concerns voiced by some present. \nTo the extent that the UK seeks to be a force for good, what I principally wish to address is remarks concerning preparedness in changed and changing circumstances. Perhaps challenges to the rules-based international order started most blatantly back in 2008 when the world witnessed the Russo-Georgian War. Six years later, in 2014, Russia illegally annexed Crimea and started a war in eastern Ukraine, which eventually transformed into a full-blown attack on the country, and which continues to this day. In the meancreated_at, putting to one side its annexation of Tibet in 1951, China has been attempting to redraw rights of sea passage in the South China Sea by constructing an array of extensive military facilities and has systematically eroded Hong Kong's freedoms. Alarmingly, it has also on multiple occasions categorically asserted its aim to unify democratic Taiwan with mainland China, threatening to do so by force if necessary. But it is not just Russia and China, though they are the most important disrupters. There are numerous countries and regimes that are not full participants in the rules-based order or which, like Iran and North Korea, pretty much play by their own rules. The result is a world where an increasing number of nations and societies put a low value on human life - President Putin does not value the lives of conscripts and convicts at all - where there is the highest ever number of conflicts in process, and where the UN is highly challenged due to players who do not accept the current rules. In particular, Russia and China have a veto on the Security Council. A significant number of countries feel that the system is not working for them and in the meancreated_at, need, greed and corruption see democracy being eroded on an alarming scale. In the 2000s and 2010s, the democracies became complacent. On the one hand, Russia retreated from international aggression and entered a short and confused era. On our side, we became risk averse as we clung to that old system, and we became averse to conflict and reluctant in the use of force. We made steep reductions in defence spending and were comfortable in what seemed to be a period of peace. But the integrated review of 2021 and its refresh already pronounced the decay of the rules-based international system, so for the democracies this new era of intensifying geopolitical competition requires new thinking. The extent of the challenge posed by large authoritarian states is clear. My good friends at the Council on Geostrategy - I declare an interest as a member of its advisory board - have summarised the mounting challenges we face succinctly under three headings, each highly destructive. First, we face an anti-systemic drive, primarily from Russia. Russia lacks the means to replace the prevailing order with a new one, even in the Euro-Atlantic area. Instead, it focuses on an anti-systemic approach designed to spoil and degrade the free and open international order, with a specific focus on eastern Europe, where, due to proximity and history, it is strongest. Secondly, we face a counter-systemic challenge, primarily from China. Beijing seeks to break down the free and open international order before replacing it with a new one centred on an authoritarian China. Thirdly, on a different point, many leading democracies seem unprepared to generate the power needed to underpin the system. For example, defence spending remains very low by historical standards, even when taking into account recent rises in Nato countries - particularly Poland and Germany - and elsewhere, such as Japan. We need to move faster to invest in our infrastructure, domestic industrial base and state autonomy to move away from economic links with authoritarian rivals. This is particularly acute when it comes to China, on which we have become dependent for many critical minerals and manufactures. It is created_at for a rethink and a more vigorous stance in defence of our freedoms, prosperity and that which we hold dear. We need to think more about shaping the international order of the future - a free and open international order. This means that we need to learn to value power and be willing to utilise it once again. Our competitors appear to understand power very well and they are prepared to take risks: from building fake islands in the South China Sea to invading foreign countries such as Ukraine. Perhaps, sadly, they have come to understand power and escalation better than we do. Undoubtedly, they recognise the extent to which the democracies would really far rather not engage in hostilities. But unfortunately, in this new world, power is going to be increasingly important to international relations. It always was critical. In the 1990s, however, our power became invisible and less\n"

    "text": "\nBangkok, Nov 21 (EFE).- U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin assured that Beijing has rejected a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Minister Dong Jun, in Laos, where both are participating this Thursday in a Southeast Asian security ministerial meeting with their partners.\n\"I regret that China has chosen not to meet here. The decision by the People's Republic of China is a step backward for the entire region,\" Austin told media from Laos, according to a Pentagon statement Wednesday.\nAustin and Dong are participating today in Vientiane at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) defense ministers' meeting in Vientiane with their partners (Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the U.S.).\nWhile it was hoped that the defense chiefs of the world's major powers could meet in the margins of the meeting, Austin considered it \"unfortunate\" that China had declined the face-off, without the American going into explaining the reasons.\n\"You have to be in touch to be able to get an explanation for their decision. It's unfortunate. It affects the whole region because they really want to see two major powers talking to each other, which would send a message of reassurance,\" Austin added.\nChina, for its part, has so far not commented on the matter.\nAccording to CNN, Beijing reportedly rejected the meeting between Dong and Austin because of Washington's October arms sales to Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China does not rule out invading and which the U.S. supplies with ammunition and would in principle defend.\nDong and Austin had first met at a security forum in Singapore in June, formalizing the restoration of high-level contact between the two powers, cut off after former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022.\nTensions did not ease until Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping met in San Francisco in November 2023.\nAustin ruled out that the lack of a meeting this created_at will have \"any implications going forward,\" amid uncertainty in the region ahead of the impending change of administration in the U.S. and the shift in Defense that may entail.\n\"I just think it's something they've chosen to do at this created_at and only they can explain why they've chosen not to take advantage of a good opportunity,\" he said.\nASEAN ministers (formed by Burma, Brunei, Cambodia, Philippines, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam) conclude today with their partners their annual two-day summit in Vientiane, with several hot spots in the region, including Burma and the South China Sea, and in the midst of an escalating war in Ukraine, Gaza and Lebanon.

    "text": "\nIndia, Jan. 18 -- 1The Paper Boat: A Refugee Story was based on your family's journey from Vietnam to Canada. You were two years old when you migrated... How did ants find their way into this tale?\nYes, this book is about my family's migration across the South China Sea. I took the direction of talking about the ants because that is the most personal piece of the story. As a child, whenever I asked my mum about the war, she told me this story about how she used to rescue ants from sugar bowls when she was little. These ants came back to reciprocate her kindness, when we were fleeing the country. It was dark at night, and she got lost in tall grass. By the moonlight, she saw a trail of ants and followed them. They led her and all of us to safety. They took us to the riverbed where the escape boat was waiting.\n2Books about refugees are often about persecution, loss, assimilation into a new culture, or a fight for social justice. What made you focus on karma instead?\nThat comes from what my mum chose to remember, amid all the death and destruction. Over 1.6 million refugees escaped Vietnam. With her Buddhist belief system, she took this in and decided to stay optimistic. She believed that her good actions were rewarded. While conducting research, I got to interact with a lot of people who escaped from Vietnam on boats. Some of the survivors mentioned that they saw a goddess in the waters waiting for them with a lotus flower in her hand, and she took them safely across.\n3Could you tell us more about this tradition of sugar bowls for ants?\nBasically, people used to put sugar in a bowl and fill it up with water. Ants like sweet stuff, so they crawled into the bowl to drink the sweet water. People did this to get rid of ants. Many families, like ours, had to downsize and adopt a new lifestyle because they lost so much during the war. The houses were shacks. It was hard to keep the floors clean and it was common to find ants. My mother liked helping the ants, so she saved them from drowning.\n4Would you describe the process of writing this book as therapeutic?\nAbsolutely! Interviewing my family, reading up on the history of Vietnam, watching documentaries - all of it was deeply enriching. I was able to understand things that my parents were not too comfortable talking about. I did some research on ants too, because I wanted to understand those creatures. Slowly, I began to make connections between refugees and ants. Both are so resilient, constantly adapting and working together.\nAnother aspect that I want to highlight is how important representation has become in the publishing industry. People are telling their own stories, unlike in the 1980s and '90s. The books coming out have a strong element of authenticity. There is an audience for all kinds of stories.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Lucknow.

Can the Minister update us on who is attending from the UK? I would welcome an update in this respect. We led with the previous Trump Administration on establishing the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance. \nI hope that will go from strength to strength during the second Trump presidency. On women's rights, we led on important issues such as WPS and women mediators' networks. I would welcome an update on Women Mediators across the Commonwealth, which the last Government established. There is also the question of addressing terrorism and extremism. We need international collaboration to combat terrorism and ensure the security of nations. The UK's commitment to upholding the international rules-based system, even amid rising challenges, by prioritising what we are best at - diplomacy, standing up for justice and inclusive development - must remain at the heart of our foreign policy approach. It is for us and the Government to keep this flame alive. My lords, I thank the noble baroness, Lady Northover, for her comprehensive introduction to this important debate. I think many of us will be emphasising the many points that she made. That there is a threat to the system of political, legal and economic rules which have governed international relations since the end of World War II is in no doubt. A new feudal order is emerging. The question becomes should this, if not be accepted, at least remain unchallenged or should there be new international norms and treaties taking into account current realities such as environmental conditions, international commitments, and principles of national sovereignty and self-determination? If the latter, what might these new norms look like and who would draft them? Perhaps it is preferable to go for a middle way and focus on reforms to the existing order. The task is to salvage an international order that is now gravely weakened. The last almost 80 years underpinned the principles of sovereignty, democracy and human rights. More recently, international rules have resulted in trade liberalisation through economic governance, the advent of a number of new peacekeeping missions, the International Criminal Court, as we have heard, and the insistence on women's and LGBT rights. But there remains suspicion and departure from these accepted norms because they are perceived as imposing a system invented by liberal democracies for the benefit of western diplomatic, military and economic agendas. These growing views of western manipulation have given rise to a gradual but quickening departure from these rules. Egregious examples abound. They include the distaste for multilateralism, with Trump - I nearly said \"chump\" - insisting on the unimpeded exercise of American power in pursuit of defined national interests, China's preference for bilateral diplomatic transactions, together with a new-found assertiveness in the UN, as well as its unbending approach where its interests are threatened, an example of which is its refusal to abide by the court of arbitration decision concerning disputes with the Philippines over the South China Sea, and, of course, Russia's subversion of international rules. We have the continuing fragmentation of the system brought about by new centres of world power, increasing populist and nationalist pressures, new and empowered centres of political dissent, international crime and terror networks, and the rise of non-state actors, among other 21st-century developments. This democratic backsliding and the accompanying rise in authoritarianism threatens international peace and stability by undermining the democratic political process - for example, by using technology supply chains\n"

Our global footprint is massively disproportionate to the size of our tiny islands. If the UK is a citizen of the world, what kind of citizen must we be? I say we are one that comes to the assistance of others who are in need, does not shrink from challenging those who abuse minorities, refuses to support those who prevent women accessing rights, and never turns a blind eye to those who disempower their own citizens. \nWe establish our place and our identity as a citizen of the world if we uphold our obligations and encourage others to do likewise\". My lords, this has been yet another fascinating, wide-ranging debate in your Lordships' House, and I join others in thanking the noble baroness, Lady Northover, for securing it. I thought she introduced the topic very well, although I have to say that I did not agree with her on her list of authoritarian leaders, including President Trump alongside Presidents Putin and Xi. Of course, like many people, I do not agree with or support some of the wilder statements that President Trump comes out with, but there are many checks and balances in the US system that simply do not exist in Russia and China: Congress, 52 independently minded states, independent courts, etc. As my noble friend Lord Gascoigne reminded us, Trump won a fair, democratic election, and, of course, we know that he can serve only a four-year term. By all means, criticise some of his statements - I suspect that we will spend a lot of created_at in the next few months and years ruminating on the various utterances of President Trump - but I think the noble baroness made a flawed analogy in comparing the US, which, in my view, is still the world's greatest democracy, with Russia and China, so I hope she will reflect on that. The rules-based international order has enabled nations large and small to co-operate under shared principles, ensuring that the rule of law prevails over the rule of might. Today, however, as many have pointed out in this debate, this order is under threat as never before, and it is incumbent upon us, as defenders of freedom, sovereignty and stability, to address many of those challenges head on. As many have pointed out, the first and most visible challenges come from the authoritarian states that I just mentioned, particularly Russia and China, whose actions flagrantly undermine international norms. Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and brutal war in Ukraine represent a blatant rejection of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, a core tenet of the UN Charter. I listened with interest to the comment from the noble lord, Lord Liddell: possibly like Tony Blair at the created_at, I was optimistic about the direction Russia could go in following the collapse of the Soviet Union. I think all of us wanted to see Russia admitted into the family of western democratic states, and there was a possibility that that would happen, but we all now see the direction that Russia has taken, and we have to recognise it for what it is now: a threat to the international order and to European security. Similarly, across the South China Sea, we see China's militarisation, economic coercion of smaller states, and flagrant disregard for any international rulings on territories or the famous lines that they impose on the maps, seemingly making up and deciding what is Chinese sovereign territory. This really offers a systemic challenge to the global order. These actions are not just mere aberrations. They are, in my view, deliberate attempts to reshape the international order into one that privileges power over principles. Such behaviour destabilises regions, weakens alliances and creates a permissive environment for other rogue actors to flout international law - we can see how Russia is now cosying up to those paragons of democracy in North Korea and Iran to further its aims. The second challenge lies in the erosion of trust within the system itself. Many multilateral institutions that were indeed put in place initially to safeguard global stability are increasingly seen as ineffective or politicised. The failure of some organisations to act decisively against aggression or hold nations accountable risks undermining their very legitimacy.\n"

    "text": "\n Nguyen Hoang Anh, owner of a logistics company in Vietnam, is one of the 2.500 lucky ones around the world who have in their garage a Porsche 911 Dakar, a version that is characterized by enjoying up to 80 millimeters more ground clearance than a 911 Carrera, aluminum protections, a steerable rear axle, an unprecedented Rallye Launch Control system or Rallye and Offroad driving modes, among other features that served this Vietnamese to, once collected his brand new unit in September 2023, enter a journey through much of Asia, to travel more than 33,000 kilometers in 75 days.\n Vietnam, China and Mongolia have been some of the countries Hoang Anh has passed through with his 911 Dakar, which sports a GT Metallic silver paint job and faced the tough route without any changes or preparation: \"After all, it is designed for extreme situations,\" he explains. He admits to having done a two-day, 2,000-kilometer test drive in Vietnam before he took the plunge. And not for the car, but for himself, as he admits that, at 54 years of age, he is no longer designed for such extreme situations.\nAnd although the 911 Dakar has been given a twin-turbocharged engine with 480 hp and 570 Nm of maximum torque. With these figures, the sporty off-roader of the German firm accelerates from 0 to 100 km / h in 3.4 seconds and reaches a top speed of 240 km / h, a value that is limited by the off'road tires and its speed code more moderate than in other 911.\nThis was his adventure\n On September 19, Hoang Anh began his adventure, accompanied by two friends, at the wheel of a pickup truck and an off-road vehicle, with whom he communicates by walkie-talkie, or by telephone if necessary. A first stage takes them along the coast of the South China Sea to the west, through Laos. \"My goal is to go through landscapes that a 911 has never been through before. We don't have a detailed route in mind. Just overnight stops and border crossings that require permission. Like now between Laos and China,\" explains the protagonist.\n As the days go by, the next destination is the Chaka Salt Lake in Qinghai, on the Tibetan plateau, a crystal-clear water surface at an altitude of about 3,100 meters. Later, in Xinjiang, in northwest China, you arrive for the first created_at in the Gobi Desert, which shows the first sandy areas and rugged terrain. In fact, it is at this point that Hoang Anh, as he recounts, ties a small bundle of firecrackers with a rope to the back of the 911 to cross the steppe. This is not only permitted in China, but is a common custom, as it is said to ward off evil spirits and clear the way to happiness.\n Then they reach the Chinese section of the famous Karakoram Highway between Pakistan and China, which runs through the Khunjerab Pass to Kashgar, a once important city on the Silk Road, located on the border with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. It reaches an altitude of up to 4,714 meters, and is known in the region as the eighth wonder of the world. They then cross the Dushanzi Gorge and continue on to Kuqa over the Tian Shan Mountains.\n The journey progresses and after more than a month, in the Gobi desert region of Mongolia, the first problems arise: the sharp edges of the rocks slash two of the 911 Dakar's tires. Fortunately, they have two spare tires on board. However, it is a complicated scenario, and Hoang Anh says that \"the harsh desert terrain continued to worry him. Sliding on the sand is like flying, the large stones in some parts of the route make it almost impossible to move forward quickly. A surface where only the tracks of previous vehicles indicate the direction\".\n Everything moves forward, and after solving some incident such as a blow to the rear bumper caused by a stone, the trip goes viral and ends up gathering thousands of followers. So much so that a video quickly generates more than two million views on social networks. At the same created_at, the hashtags \"Vietnam911\" and \"UncleVietnamese\" emerge on Chinese social networks. After crossing all kinds of terrain and almost unbelievable places, the trip faces its final stretch. Before stopping in Mohe, the northernmost town in China and the coldest in winter, with temperatures below 30 degrees below zero, and where only a frozen river separates it from Russia. In total it has been more than 33,000 kilometers, and Hoang Anh sums it up as \"the adventure of a lifecreated_at\".\n However, there was still one more stage left in the itinerary, because last summer, months after completing the route, the protagonist received a phone call from Stuttgart: the 911 Dakar officials wanted to meet him. After a visit to the Porsche facilities in the German city and the brand's museum, there is room for future proposals, and the Vietnamese driver sets his next challenge: \"It wasn't our last adventure, and one day we'll go around the world, all the way to Stuttgart. Me and my 911 Dakar\".\n Nguyen Hoang Anh, owner of a logistics company in Vietnam, is one of the 2.500 lucky ones around the world who have a Porsche 911 Dakar in their garage, a version that is characterized by enjoying up to 80 millimeters more ground clearance than a 911 Carrera, aluminum protections, a steerable rear axle, an unprecedented Rallye Launch Control system or Rallye and Offroad driving modes, among other features that served this Vietnamese to, once collected his brand new unit in September 2023, enter into a journey through much of Asia, to travel more than 33,000 kilometers in 75 days.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-18",
    "text": "\nLawmakers in the Philippines have raised renewed concerns about the country's national grid operator and its alleged violation of foreign ownership laws, ­reviving fears about China ­wielding excessive influence over the Philippines' energy supply - including a \"kill switch\" that could turn off power across the archipelago. \nWhile analysts dismissed the possibility of such a switch, they said the issue did raise concerns about limiting skill transfers to Filipino engineers and a lack of operational transparency that could leave the country vulnerable to undue foreign influence over critical infrastructure. \nAt the centre of the controversy is the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), which is 60 per cent owned by the Filipino-led Synergy Grid of the Philippines (SGP) and 40 per cent by the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC). \nLawmakers have alleged that the NGCP may have violated foreign ownership laws, which only allow up to 40 per cent of foreign investments in certain industries, including public utilities. \nOn January 6, Joey Salceda, chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, raised questions about the NGCP's ownership structure, including the fact that its chairman, Zhu Guangchao, is a Chinese national. \nSalceda also cited the SGP's Philippine Stock Exchange submissions, which said foreign shareholders including those of American, Chinese, Malaysian and Iranian nationalities held stocks accounting for 7.48 per cent of the company's ownership. \nThis meant the SGP had already exceeded the Philippines' constitutional limit of 40 per cent of ownership, Salceda said, alleging that the NGCP was circumventing the cap on foreign ownership. \nDuring a House hearing on legislative franchises, Representative Gerville Luistro raised similar concerns as she questioned the NGCP's lawyers on whether the company had complied with the provision on foreign ownership. \nLuistro revealed that the corporation had officials who were Chinese nationals, despite the constitutional provision that its executive and managerial officers should be Filipino citizens. \nThe NGCP's legal team clarified that the chairman presided over board meetings and had no influence, and that the corporation was wholly Filipino-led. \nPreviously state-run, the country's transmission system was restructured to allow the privatisation of the power sector in 2001 and underwent a public bidding process for private ownership in 2008. \nHowever, Dindo Manhit, president of Stratbase-ADR Institute think tank, said the NGCP might not have necessarily violated these ownership restrictions. \n\"One risk of being a publicly listed company is that anyone can purchase stocks, although limitations can be set on what types of shares the public can buy. Some shares might have a very small stake and without voting rights, giving them no influence on company decisions while still allowing investment,\" Manhit told the Post. \nManhit, who advised the rival bidding consortium in 2008, said he believed the companies involved were then properly vetted.  \nThe consortium comprising the SGCC and two Filipino-owned companies, Monte Oro Grid Resources Corporation and Calaca High Power Corporation, emerged as the winning bidder.  \nThis consortium soon established the NGCP in 2009. In 2020, the SGP secured approval to acquire these entities involved in the NGCP, giving it controlling interest over the corporation. \nLawmakers have also rehashed security concerns about the SGCC's involvement in the NGCP, reviving speculation about an \"off switch\" that could enable Chinese engineers to rob the entire country of its power with a single flick. \nThe National Transmission Corporation, the grid's previous operator, had mentioned this scenario as a possibility at a Senate session in 2019. Opposition senator Risa Hontiveros then raised questions on the extent of China's control as Beijing and Manila were embroiled in tensions in the South China Sea. \nLast week, Salceda stoked similar security fears, alleging that two Chinese officials of the NGCP were found to be reporting to Beijing. \"They're not supposed to be doing that,\" Salceda said. \nHowever, an NGCP official assured lawmakers that no such switch existed. \nAnalysts said fears about China having the ability to \"switch off\" the power grid were unfounded. \nEnrico Gloria, an associate professor of political science at the University of the Philippines and a doctoral student at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said concerns about foreign investment in the country's national grid were valid, given the sector's importance to national security. \n\"However, fears of tangible security threats, such as China's ability to 'switch off' the power grid due to its significant investment stake, remain largely theoretical,\" he said. \nFears that the NGCP could be utilised for Chinese statecraft needed to be contextualised, Gloria said, adding that during heightened tensions with China in 2012 and 2016, Chinese state-owned enterprises \"did not alter their operations in ways detrimental to the Philippines or its power sector\".  \n\"Historically, China's economic restrictions on other countries have targeted symbolic goods and products - such as bananas from the Philippines in 2012, wine and beef exports from Australia in 2020 [...] - rather than critical infrastructure,\" he said. \nAccording to Manhit, the presence of foreign ownership of the NGCP is not classified as a risk, especially since six directors are Filipinos while four are Chinese. \n\"Within the NGCP, the technical side and the control room of the grid are staffed by a majority of Filipino personnel. Filipinos who are in crucial departments of the company must also play their role in managing risks,\" he said. \nFor Alvin Camba, a critical materials specialist at Associated Universities Incorporated, the more pressing issue is the limited transfer of advanced technical knowledge to Filipino engineers. \nWhile the NGCP had greatly improved transmission lines across the country, \"the degree to which we train engineers is ­limited only to mid-level ­[activities]\", said Camba, who has previously researched the SGCC's investment in the NGCP. \n\"When it comes to the ­high-level things and the most important technologies, it's ­actually outside the hands of Filipinos.\"\n"

    "text": "\nBy Jeffrey Frankel\nPredictions about 2025 come with flashing caveats: no one can know what US President-elect Donald Trump will do, let alone how the rest of the world will respond. But one can speculate. Imagine it is January 2026.\nAs 2025 began, the mood of the American business community shifted. Some businesspeople had long harboured private doubts about Trump's anti-globalisation campaign. But overall confidence began to fall when they came face to face with the possible consequences of cutting the US economy off from international trade and migration: sharply higher prices of imported products and labour shortages in some sectors.\nPublic anxieties multiplied as mysterious cyber-attacks caused a series of failures affecting US power infrastructure, and water and sanitation systems. Some childhood diseases like measles returned. From Inauguration Day, social media hesitated to highlight efforts by public health and information technology professionals to correct the accompanying misinformation.\nMost dramatic in the first half of 2025 was the correction in the US stock market, with the S&P 500 index down by around 35%. To be sure, the market had been ripe for a correction. The S&P 500 had increased sevenfold between January 2009 and the 2024 election, fuelled by stronger-than-expected growth in US output and employment in 2021-24. By the end of President Joe Biden's term, stocks had entered bubble territory. Whether evaluated relative to earnings, dividends, capital stock replacement value, or GDP, share prices had reached levels reminiscent of 1929 and other pre-crash episodes.\nBut it took a needle to prick the bubble. Having gained majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Republicans also gained responsibility for producing a federal budget. But they were split: while they agreed that the United States was on an unsustainable fiscal path, they disagreed on the solution. One faction touted lower taxes as the key to fiscal virtue (dismissing the \"experts' view\" that this would worsen the budget balance rather than improve it), and the other, spurred by Elon Musk, emphasised spending cuts. (The much-hyped Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) - headed by Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy - had little impact in 2025.)\nBudget negotiations devolved into an all-too-familiar game of chicken. When neither side flinched, the US faced a fiery collision, in the form of a month-long government shutdown and credit downgrades by all three major ratings agencies, which in turn crashed stock and bond markets.\nAs the year drew to a close, some observers argued that the US is in recession. In any case, rising inflation - fuelled by Trump's tariffs and his attacks on the US Federal Reserve's independence - augurs the return of 1970s-style stagflation.\nAt the same created_at, there was a vast divergence between what Trump's supporters and opponents expected and what they got in 2025. As it turned out, the business community unexpectedly prevailed on him for higher caps on the number of H-1B visas (for high-skilled workers) and expansion of other legal immigration channels. Trump also re-reversed himself on TikTok. He made big changes to his cabinet, firing secretary of health and human services Robert Kennedy, Jr, who sought tougher regulations for pharmaceutical companies.\nBeyond the economy, Trump took other unexpected steps. His most startling volte-face was his support of states guaranteeing a woman's right to abortion. He insisted that he has always believed the matter should be decided at the state level. In terms of foreign policy, one big shock was the first armed US incursion into Mexico in over a century.\nBefore that, Trump withdrew support from Ukraine, as expected, effectively surrendering to Russia and thereby fatally undermining US credibility in the eyes of potential adversaries, not least Russian President Vladimir Putin himself. Russian troops moved into parts of Georgia and ominously popped up along its 1,500-mile border with NATO, tying down their Western counterparts throughout the year.\nWith the US distracted, and a new precedent set regarding respect - or the lack thereof - for national borders, Venezuela invaded Guyana, Ethiopia invaded Somalia, and Indonesia invaded Timor Leste. Unencumbered by the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, from which Trump withdrew in 2018, and weakened by the decimation of its proxies in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, the Iranian regime completed its development of nuclear weapons.\nMost alarming, however, were naval actions by China, whether a reaction to its economic downturn, which Trump's tariffs have exacerbated, or an effort to exploit America's current weakness. Throughout the year, Chinese forces were active in the waters around Taiwan and on newly fortified islands that it claims in the South China Sea. With Trump's tough-guy reputation roundly questioned, he surprised everyone when he responded to a ship collision, in which several US sailors were killed, by sending a joint US-Philippine naval force to retake Scarborough Shoal and the Spratly Islands. In a pattern familiar from modern history, the Trump administration carried out a threat of military intervention that it had neglected to signal in advance.\nAt year end, China's coast guard appeared to be installing a \"quarantine\" of Taiwan. Trump has now sent all naval forces the US can spare to break the blockade if necessary. As 2026 gets underway, fears of a hot war between the two nuclear superpowers seem all too real.\nThroughout 2025, Trump's opponents consoled themselves with thoughts of a silver lining: their fellow Americans would finally see the consequences of having such a president. Before long, his influence would plummet, both in Congress and among the electorate, as he spent more created_at playing golf at Mar-a-Lago.\nNo such luck. As usual, Trump blames the disruptions and disasters of 2025 on anyone or anything other than himself. Likewise, his supporters do not see the adverse developments of 2025 as his fault. Why should they, when they never have before? True, Trump's supporters are unable to distil the appropriate lessons from history. But in predicting that they will, his opponents are ignoring history as well.\nThe writer is professor of capital formation and growth, Harvard University, and research associate, US National Bureau of Economic Research.\nDisclaimer:Views expressed are personal and do not reflect the official position or policy ofFinancialExpress.com.

    "text": "\nIn the last decade, Britain’s relations with China have been on a rollercoaster. In 2015, during the visit of Chinese leader Xi Jinping to the UK, then chancellor George Osborne was able to declare the two countries were in a “ golden era  ”. He did this with the conviction that with a growing economy and rising middle class, China offered plenty of opportunities for Britain. But by 2022, Rishi Sunak had declared the “ end of the golden era  ”. And in 2023, deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden  labelled China Britain’s greatest economic security threat, to align closer with the position of the US, and through fears of deeper Chinese espionage and interference in the outside world. Seldom had a diplomatic boom-bust cycle happened so rapidly and so completely.\nIn view of extremes such as these, to see a return to unvarnished, largely conventional engagement looks like a revolution. In the past, Rachel Reeves turning up in Beijing for a high-level economic dialogue , as she did over the weekend, would have attracted little notice. China is, after all, still the world’s second largest economy and accounts for about a fifth of global GDP. Its middle class , despite recent domestic economic turbulence, constitutes one of the most dynamic and sought-after consumer groups on the planet. But in 2025, such a visit looks like radical action because of the dramatic deterioration that occurred in the final years of the Conservative administration.\nIf the hyperbole of the “golden era” was a little too much, the shrill anger and demands for almost total decoupling after the pandemic set in during 2020 went too far the other way. China and Britain have never been easy partners. Their history of argument and clashing goes back at least to the early 19th century and the period of the Anglo-Chinese wars. But they have always talked with each other and always sought to have a relationship.\nThese days, the rows are about Hong Kong, Xinjiang , China’s behaviour in the South China Sea  and its attitude towards Taiwan. These all stand out as perennial points of disagreement. What has changed, however, is the amount of leverage that London has in trying to get Beijing to take notice of anything it says. Chinese leaders are not dismissive of the UK. They understand Britain as a close security ally of the US, a fellow member of the UN security council permanent five , and a significant player for finance and some forms of technology. But the reality is that they have a bigger picture to focus on and a limited to nonexistent appetite for being lectured by a power they see as smaller and weaker than they are.\nA great deal of the turbulence in the Britain-China relationship recently can be put down to issues outside Britain’s direct control. The first Trump presidency and the trade wars caused the start of geopolitical divisions that continue to this day. The US and China  are in a period of deep competition and disagreement. The UK and everyone else exist in the shadow that casts.\nAlso the pandemic and what was seen as its mismanagement by China caused major problems for its international image. In the UK, polls show that perceptions of China deteriorated rapidly  around that created_at. These issues were exacerbated by the hardline Chinese management of Hong Kong  because of Britain’s ongoing interests with the city, and its generally nationalist and populist style of politics today.\nBut even in the roughest moments, only the most dogmatic in Britain argued against some form of engagement. Reeves’s visit to China attracted criticism. But for her to not go there at some point would have been even less defensible. Britain’s stagnant growth, the barriers to more traditional markets like Europe because of Brexit, the neverending challenges of poor productivity – all of these mean that the risks of not engaging with China to see what investment and trade might be possible are higher than the risks of doing so.\nThe reality in early 2025 for Britain can be easily stated. Chinese investment  here has remained essentially static, from 0.1% of stocks  a decade ago to about 0.2% today.  In 2024, China was Britain’s fifth-largest trading partner, but much of that is through imports here rather than UK-China exports. China spends about 20 created_ats more on research and development than Britain. And despite rising fees, the 150,000 Chinese students at British universities still make a massive contribution to the sector. Seeing more Chinese finance companies working in London would bolster its credential to continue as a major international finance hub. And while the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer BYD  has a presence in Britain, seeing more companies like this in sectors such as high-speed rail or automotives or renewable energy would at least offer a basis for getting access to Chinese knowhow and capital. And getting improved access to their domestic market would still be a great step forward.\nBritain doing better in its relations with China doesn’t mean going head over heels for total alignment. The two countries will never be close allies and will always disagree on as much as they agree. But they can definitely create a more pragmatic, even-tempered relationship. Reeves’s visit secured £600m of deals. The Xi visit in 2015 apparently produced more than 50 created_ats this amount.  But in view of the almost complete inactivity in recent years, at least this was something. And one thing is for sure: China might possibly listen to a country that has at least some joint economic links and trade with it. But it won’t give a second’s attention to a place with no links at all. Britain needs to deal with China. It is folly to think otherwise.\n                                                               Kerry Brown is director of the Lau China Institute, King’s College London. He is the author of The Great Reversal: Britain, China and the 400 Year Contest for Power\n"

    "text": "\nLANGKAWI, Malaysia (AP) — Southeast Asian foreign ministers gathered Sunday for their first meeting this year under the regional bloc's new chair, Malaysia, seeking a breakthrough over Myanmar’s drawn-out civil war and territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\nThe retreat on the idyllic northern resort island of Langkawi was the first major meeting of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations hosted by Malaysia. Officials said it aims to chart the bloc’s direction for the year as it tries to resolve Myanmar's deadly four-year crisis and tensions over China’s increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea.\nMalaysian Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan said Myanmar — represented by a low-level Foreign Ministry official after its junta leaders were barred from formal ASEAN meetings — briefed the gathering about plans for a general election this year. But the bloc wants Myanmar's government to ensure peace before any polls are held, he said.\n“We said the election has to be inclusive. The election cannot be in isolation, it has to involve all stakeholders,” he told a news conference at the end of the retreat. “We told them the election is not our priority. Our priority is to stop the violence.”\nThe crisis in Myanmar has emerged as one of the bloc’s biggest challenges since a military coup ousted an elected civilian government in February 2021, plunging the country into conflict. It has sparked an armed resistance movement, with rebel forces now controlling large parts of the country. The war has killed tens of thousands of people, and displaced millions.\nASEAN’s peace plan and other efforts to seek a solution have so far been futile, hampered by the bloc's non-interference policy and the Myanmar junta's refusal to comply. The military government hopes an election will legitimize its rule, but critics say polls are unlikely to be free or fair.\nMalaysia, which brought Myanmar into ASEAN during its chairmanship of the bloc in 1997, is expected to take a more proactive stance as the Myanmar crisis has led to the flourishing of criminal activities, online scams and human trafficking along Myanmar’s border.\nHasan said Malaysia had appointed Othman Hashim, a former foreign ministry senior official, as special envoy for ASEAN chair to Myanmar to engage various factions in the country to find a way forward.\n“We have no intention to carve out Myanmar,” he said, adding that dialogue and diplomacy were the best strategies to help the country return to a democratic path.\nHasan said the meeting also discussed implications of the second term of incoming U.S. President Donald Trump on the region amid its rivalry with China. He said ministers raised concerns that competition between the major powers may increase tensions and have spillover effects in the region. He said ASEAN ministers stressed the urgency to bolster regional unity and make economic integration a top priority amid the global uncertainties.\n“We must ensure that ASEAN remains our central go-to platform for solution seeking... We are the speakers and not the spoken-for. We must drive our own path forward,” he said.\nTensions in the South China Sea, one of the world's vital shipping lanes, were also high on the agenda following violent confrontations in the waters last year. Hasan said the ministers called for accelerated negotiations between ASEAN and China on a code of conduct in the waterway. Officials earlier targeted them for conclusion in 2026 but the talks have stalled over disagreements including whether the pact should be binding and its scope of coverage.\n“We stressed that the South China Sea must remain peaceful and stable,” Hasan said.\nASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei along with Taiwan have overlapping claims with China, which asserts sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea.\nChinese and Philippine vessels clashed repeatedly last year. Chinese forces also assaulted Vietnamese fishermen and Chinese patrol vessels ventured into areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones. ASEAN has not openly criticized China, which is the bloc’s top trading partner.\nAs chair, Malaysia is likely to push for quiet diplomacy as it balances security challenges with economic gains, analysts say.\n“It would be pragmatism on Malaysia’s side, as the country — as well as ASEAN as a whole — lack the diplomatic and military heft to confront China on the South China Sea,” said Muhamamd Faizal Abdul Rahman, a research fellow at Singapore's S.Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines is currently engaged in a significant diplomatic confrontation with China over the presence of a massive Chinese Coast Guard vessel, referred to as the \"Monster,\" in its territorial waters. This situation has escalated tensions between the two nations, particularly concerning overlapping claims in the resource-rich South China Sea.The Philippines has accused the 12,000-ton Chinese vessel, officially known as CCG 5901, of maintaining an \"illegal presence\" within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Philippine Coast Guard spokesman Jay Tarriela stated that their vessel, BRP Cabra, has been monitoring and tailing the Chinese ship since it was first detected near Capones Island in Zambales province.The Philippine government has lodged formal protests against China's actions, describing them as aggressive and alarming. National Security Council spokesperson Jonathan Malaya emphasized that the ship's proximity—77 nautical miles from the Philippine coast—was unacceptable and called for its immediate withdrawal.On January 18, during bilateral talks in Xiamen, Philippine officials confronted their Chinese counterparts about this maricreated_at intrusion. \nThe discussions underscored Manila's serious concerns regarding China's maricreated_at activities and their implications for regional stability.The presence of the \"Monster\" ship is viewed as part of China's broader strategy to assert dominance in the South China Sea, a crucial shipping route and area rich in natural resources. Philippine officials have expressed that they will not back down from what they perceive as intimidation tactics by China, stating that \"all options are on the table\" for response.The ongoing tensions are rooted in historical disputes over territorial claims in the South China Sea. An international tribunal ruling in 2016 invalidated many of China's expansive claims; however, Beijing has continued to assert its rights over these waters. Under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the Philippines has taken a more assertive stance to defend its territorial interests, leading to increased confrontations with Chinese maricreated_at forces.This situation remains fluid, with both nations navigating complex geopolitical dynamics that could have broader implications for regional security and international law compliance.AFP\n"

    "text": "\n Manila would be able to raise South China Sea-related issues that could 'embarrass' Beijing and nudge it into a compromise, analysts say   \nA seat on the UN Security Council would give the Philippines its highest-profile platform yet to confront Beijing over its expansive claims in the South China Sea. \nBut as President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr courts global support in his bid to become a non-permanent member, the question remains: can Manila outmanoeuvre China on the world stage? \n\"We need to further strengthen multilateralism efforts that will reform the Security Council and revitalise the general sencreated_atnt,\" Marcos Jnr said last weekend during a toast at the \"vin d'honneur\", a formal gathering at the presidential palace attended by diplomats, including China's ambassador. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nThe president's appeal, which stressed the importance of a \"rules-based international order\", asserted his administration's determination to assert its place in global diplomacy. He pointed to the Philippines' \"rich experience\" in peacekeeping, consensus-building, and fostering cooperation as the foundation for its candidacy for the 2027-28 Security Council term. \n\"With a long history and a credible record of multilateral diplomacy,\" he said, \"the Philippines is in a very strong position to take on more leadership roles that seek to advocate on consequential issues in the global agenda.\" \nBut while Marcos Jnr paints a picture of high-minded diplomacy, analysts say his campaign carries clear strategic intent: leveraging the Security Council seat to corner Beijing. \nChina, a permanent member of the UN Security Council with veto power, looms large over Manila's bid. Beijing's sweeping South China Sea claims - which encompass almost all of the disputed waterway - collide head-on with the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. \nWith a seat on the council, Manila could raise South China Sea-related resolutions, even though China is certain to veto them. \nStill, the very act of putting forward such resolutions could be a diplomatic coup. \"The votes would embarrass Beijing,\" said Greg Poling, director of the Southeast Asia programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \n\"If combined with additional resolutions in the General Assembly and new arbitrations, [this strategy] would impose costs on China and manoeuvre Beijing towards an eventual compromise,\" he told This Week in Asia. \nManila, according to experts, is well-positioned to secure a seat. The Philippines has deployed 14,000 troops to 21 UN peacekeeping missions over six decades and previously held a non-permanent seat on the council in 2004-2005. \nNot only that, but within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - a 10-member bloc that also includes Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore - there is an explicit agreement to support each other's Security Council bids. \n\"All 10 members of Asean agreed years ago to support each other in a rotation on the Security Council,\" Poling said. \"It was Vietnam's turn previously and now it is the Philippines. So, if any member of Asean doesn't support the Philippines' bid, it will be violating an explicit promise.\" \nThe campaign is not without its sceptics, however. Some observers questioned how much practical impact a non-permanent seat could wield, given China's veto power. Jennifer Parker, an expert associate at the Australian National University's National Security College, warned that the Philippines' bid - though likely to garner significant support - faced challenges. \n\"Vietnam has publicly supported the Philippines' bid, but it's unclear how much broader support the Philippines has at this stage,\" Parker said. \n\"A seat on the council would help the Philippines further highlight its concerns about China's actions in the South China Sea. However, any position they hold in the council is unlikely to result in resolutions on the issue, given China's veto power.\" \nThe UN Security Council comprises five permanent members - China, France, Russia, Britain and the United States - and 10 non-permanent members elected for two-year terms. Securing a seat requires a two-thirds majority vote in the General Assembly. \nOther analysts see the bid as a way for Marcos Jnr to craft a legacy. Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute's Southeast Asia programme, said a seat on the Security Council could serve both domestic and strategic purposes for the Marcos administration. \n\"With the support of Asean as a regional organisation, Manila's campaign for a seat may likely succeed,\" he told This Week in Asia. \"China and the US, including US allies, are competing for influence in Southeast Asia, and they would like to be seen as supportive of Asean rather than as an unfriendly partner.\" \nPoling said the Philippines was competing against Kyrgyzstan for the seat and, with the support of Asean and the US, should be the favourite to win. \nAsean member states that have served as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council include Vietnam, which most recently held a seat for the 2020-2021 term, Indonesia and Singapore. Malaysia has been elected for four separate terms. \nThe Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs has made it clear that the push for a seat is no ordinary diplomatic endeavour, previously calling it \"very important\" for the country. \n\"We'll be able to engage in the most important dialogues and debates and vote on important issues,\" Eduardo de Vega, an undersecretary at the department, told local media. \n\"We have interests in the rule of law and international law, maintaining peace and stability,\" he was quoted as saying. \"We have millions of Filipinos overseas and we need the world to continue living and aspiring for goals for which the UN was created.\" \nOthers say that a seat could bolster the Philippines' moral position in its territorial dispute with China. Sherwin Ona, a visiting fellow at Taiwan's Institute for National Defence and Security Research, argued that the campaign underscored the importance of the rule of law in international relations. \n\"This places the Philippines in a stronger diplomatic position and can open opportunities to strengthen our advocacies and position in the South China Sea,\" said Ona, who is also an associate professor of political science at De La Salle University in Manila. \nThe road ahead remains uncertain, however. \"To what extent this strategy may work is questionable,\" Rahman said. \"But having a place on the council is still critical if Manila wants to reinforce its position vis-a-vis China.\" \nHe agreed that the Marcos administration was likely to gain support from the US, other Western states, and Asian powers such as Japan and South Korea. Other countries wishing to signal their endorsement of Manila's South China Sea stance may also back Manila's bid. \nBut with the 2027-28 election set for mid-2026, Parker said it was too early to predict whether it would succeed. \n\"Much will depend on China's stance and whether it chooses to actively lobby against the Philippines' bid,\" she said. \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "text": "\nManila, Jan. 19 -- The Philippines under the Marcos Jr. administration strengthened its ties with the US amid heightened tensions with China over disputed South China Sea territories, according to the think tank Capital Economics.\nIn a Jan. 17 report, Capital Economics said it expects incoming US President Donald J. Trump to possibly widen the so-called \"fracturing\" of the global economy, which has divided countries into two camps, each led by the US and China.\nIn the case of the Philippines, which has been historically leaning towards the US rather than China, Capital Economics noted that relations with its former colonizer are expected to be stronger this year.\nThe country's preference to align with the US was strongest-beyond the 80-percent level-during the Covid-19 pandemic (2021), which began in Wuhan, China.Last year, it remained strong at around the same degree.\nOther ASEAN countries like Singapore and Vietnam also prefer to align with the US over China, a choice which, according to Capital Economics,hasnot shifted.\n\"The one country in Southeast Asia that we think has moved is the Philippines-closed to the US as a response to China's efforts to extend its power in the South China Sea,\" Capital Economics pointed out.\nCapital Economics said China's share of the fractured global economy shrank last year, widening the gap between its economic bloc or alliance and that of the United States and its allies.\nAt the beginning of 2025, China and its geopolitical allies accounted for less than one-third of the size of the US-led bloc.\nAccording to the report, \"this fall was in part the result of a loss of support for China\" in some countries, following changes of government. It was also partly because the US experienced an economic boost in dollar terms.\nHowever, despite a weaker footing in terms of economic influence, China continues to be the world's manufacturing powerhouse, producing more than the US and its closest allies combined.\nTrump2.0-led US\nThe US President-elect Trump will be inaugurated on Monday, Jan. 20, which will officially mark his comeback to the White House and his reentry into the political playing field.\nUnlike the current Marcos Jr. admin, its predecessor-the Duterte administration-had closer ties with China as the US was a critic of the bloody war on drugs.\nWhile Trump's return has not changed the bloc compositions, his re-election \"may prove to be the most consequential development of the past year for the path of global fracturing.\"\nTrump's return to office \"raises questions about the chances of a significant realignment over the years ahead,\" and there are also doubts about whether the economic divide between camps led by the strategic rivals will still make sense in the future.\nBy composition, the China bloc covers more land and has a slightly larger population than the US bloc, but reports showed that in 2024 it generated just 22 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), compared to 71 percent from the US bloc.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

    "text": "\n Imposing a deadline or an ultimatum for China to remove its 'monster ship' near the Zambales coastline is 'beyond the mandate' of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).\nPCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela said this when asked about Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) vessel 5901's 'unlawful presence' about 60 to 70 nautical miles from the Zambales coastline.\nThe PCG has been monitoring its movements within the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) since the agency confirmed its presence in the area last January 4.\n'In regard to the PCG's mission, our role is to monitor and actively challenge the illegal presence of the Chinese Coast Guard for them not to normalize such unlawful patrol within our EEZ,' Tarriela told reporters in a Viber message on Sunday.\n'It is beyond our agency's mandate to impose deadlines or ultimatums on the coast guard of another state actor,' he added.\nBased on PCG's latest update, its vessel, BRP Gabriela Silang (OPV-8301) was 'actively monitoring and challenging' the presence of CCG vessel 5901.\n'During the entire maricreated_at patrol today (January 18), the PCG crew conducted a radio challenge to firmly remind the Chinese Coast Guard vessels of their unlawful actions, particularly regarding their claims of conducting maricreated_at patrols,' according to a statement issued Saturday night.\n'It is important to note that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) clarifies that the freedom of navigation for foreign-flagged vessels does not extend to conducting patrols within the EEZ of other states,' it added.\nLast week, the National Maricreated_at Council (NMC) asked the Chinese government to withdraw its 'monster ship' within the Philippine's EEZ, according to National Task Force West Philippine Sea spokesperson Jonathan Malaya.\nThis call came after the NMC announced that the Philippine government filed a diplomatic protest against the continued illegal presence and operations of CCG vessels within the country's EEZ.\nBeijing's continued aggression is based on its assertion of sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the West Philippine Sea, as it continues to reject the 2016 arbitral ruling that effectively dismissed its claims and ruled in favor of Manila.\nThe landmark ruling stemmed from a case filed by Manila in 2013, a year after its tense standoff with Beijing over Panatag Shoal, whose lagoon the latter now effectively controls.\n"

Robert Ace Barbers can't help but feel relieved and emboldened by United States (US) Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, who recently gave strong words against China's \"bullying\" in the West Philippine Sea (WPS).\n\"The stance taken by incoming US Secretary of State Senator Rubio against China's aggression in the WPS serves as a warning against China's continuing disrespect on the Philippines and Taiwan's territory and sovereignty,\" Barbers said in a statement Sunday, Jan. 19.\n\"Napakasarap malaman at marinig para sa ating mga Filipino na ang incoming US Secretary of State ay malalim ang kaalaman sa mga karumal-dumal na ginagawa ng China sa WPS laban sa Pilipinas at Taiwan at handa nila tayong tulungan sakaling may hindi magandang mangyari dito,\" added the House quad-committee (quad-comm) overall chairman.\n(For us Filipinos, It's so good to know and hear that the incoming US Secretary of State has a deep knowledge on China's appalling activities in the WPS against the Philippines as well as Taiwan, and that they are ready to help us in case something bad happens.)\nRubio slammed China's \"deeply destabilizing\" actions in the WPS, which he said could prompt the US to \"counteract\" should Beijing carry out \"anything rash or irrational\" against the Philippines or Taiwan.\nRubio, who testified before a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on his nomination to be Secretary of State on Capitol Hills, Washington DC, last Jan.15 discouraged China from carrying out \"anything rash or irrational\" when it comes to the Philippines or Taiwan if it is serious about stabilizing US-China relations.\nHe warned that if, \"God forbid,\" any \"miscommunication\" or some \"inadvertent conflict\" emerges out of China's bullying and other forms of aggressions in the WPS, the US would be forced to defend the Philippines as its treaty ally, and its impact would have on the entire globe would be enormous, \"and that includes Europe\".\nAside from firing water cannons and sideswiping, shadowing and other forms of harassments against Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) patrol ships and local fishermen in the WPS for the past two years, China naval ships and personnel continues to encroach inside the country's 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nRubio, during the US Senate hearing, cited as an example of the latest China harassment in the WPS the deployment of its 165-meter long coast guard vessel dubbed as \"monster ship\" near Zambales.\n\"The actions they (China) are taking now are deeply destabilizing; they are forcing us to take counteractions because we have commitments to the Philippines and we have commitments to Taiwan that we intend to keep,\" the former senator from Florida said.\n\"If they want to destabilize the relationship or they want to at least create some pathway for stabilization of our relationship with them, they really need to stop messing around with Taiwan and with the Philippines because it's forcing us to focus our attention in ways we prefer not to have to.\"\nIn the same hearing, Rubio emphasized Manila's \"strategic importance\" to Washington, not only from a military perspective but also over the \"real economic opportunities\" it could explore with the country.\nHe also acknowledged the Philippine government's \"welcoming attitude\" in recent years to further boost engagement with the US. \"When your engagement with a country leads to economic development-whether it's outbound US investment in the Philippines or what have you-then that becomes enduring.\"\nA July 2016 arbitration ruling by The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had invalidated China's claims in the WPS, particularly its expansive nine-dash line claim over practically the entire South China Sea.\nChina did not participate in the proceedings and has consistently rejected the ruling.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

    "text": "\nWhen Donald Trump takes office, his greatest challenge will be how he deals with the new axis of totalitarian states. This axis comprises China, North Korea, Russia, Iran, Myanmar and a growing number of others. With China at its heart, it poses the greatest threat the Free World has faced since the Cold War.\nChina is a dictatorship, committing genocide in Xinjiang to eradicate the Uyghurs , it uses forced labour, persecutes religious groups and democracy campaigners. China is now building up its military and navy  at an astonishing rate, to challenge the US. It has asserted ownership of disputed strategic territories in the South China Sea. Perhaps most critical is its threat to invade Taiwan.\nThe interesting thing about brutal dictators is that they tell you in advance what their ambitions are, as in the 1930s. Leaders in the West failed to believe Hitler and tens of millions died. Vladimir Putin couldn’t be clearer about his plans for greater Russia including Ukraine (as his seizure of Crimea demonstrated). Xi Jinping has made no secret of his plans to turn China into the dominant global superpower militarily and economically. He believes democracy and human rights are an aberration and that his form of autocracy is the historical norm. \nHaving betrayed the Sino-British treaty on Hong Kong  and grabbed the South China Seas, with the West barely making a whimper, now he plans to annex Taiwan too.\nYet China does not work alone.\nChina is still a very close partner of Putin’s Russia. Both observed the chaotic withdrawal of western troops from Afghanistan and will have reached the same conclusion that the West lacks the leadership and perseverance to stay the course. It was that debacle that emboldened Putin to invade Ukraine.  The resulting brutal war dominated by Russian barbed wire, mines and drones has led to hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded. Even now, Ukrainian men and women fight for every inch of their precious land, paying with their lives.\nThe harsh reality is that most European countries ignored the signals and had hollowed out their defence capability, spending instead on what they saw as domestic priorities. Whilst the UK led the way early in supporting Ukraine, too many Western European countries were slow to act, dependent for their energy on Russia. \nIn December 2023 I went to Washington with a small group of Conservative MPs to discuss the proposed funding for Ukraine, which at that created_at hung in the balance in Congress. This was not long after the October 7 massacre. Understandably, those Congressmen and women we met said their priority was to ensure the IDF defeated this terrorist group. Their two priorities were Israel and Taiwan. My response was that these three issues cannot be separated. The attack on Israel helped both Russia and China, by taking America’s attention off Ukraine and Taiwan.\nThe resultant delay in approving vital military supplies cost Ukraine dear in lost territory. This axis will have suspected that Israel’s needs would outweigh Kyiv’s in the US, giving Russia created_at and isolating Ukraine at a critical moment. \nTrump’s plans to achieve some kind of peace accord between Putin and President Zelensky are on the face of it laudable. However, as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher knew, the lesson of the Second World War was that peace without justice never lasts. Remember how Hitler was given the Sudetenland by France and Britain in an attempt to appease him-a year later Hitler invaded the rest of the country.\nI have been to Ukraine on a number of occasions and seen first-hand the astonishing bravery of the Ukrainian people. Their fight should be seen as our fight in the West. Ukraine deserves more than a short-term settlement, in which Putin is rewarded for his brutality. \nI hope President Trump recognises that Ukraine’s predicament has come about because of weak leadership in the west and its appeasement of Russia and China. If Ukraine is forced to accept Russia’s hold over 20 per cent of their country, as part of a settlement, then in echoes of 1938 Putin will be back for the rest. \nAnd with China looking on, our weakness will mean Taiwan is next. I pray we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.\n"

    "text": "\nTaiwanese lawmaker Chen Yeong-kang leaned forward in his overstuffed chair in an anteroom of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan as he considered the changes expected with Donald Trump's return to the White House. \n\"When we see the Trump administration, we believe that it's about flexible diplomatic methods,\" Chen, a former admiral, said. \"But I believe that every US president recognises and focuses on the importance of the peace and stability across the Indo-Pacific region, and of course, in Taiwan.\" \nSome 1,200km south, military and civilian officials in Manila sang a similar tune, arguing that precedence and long-standing ties with the United States were likely to prevail, while pointing out that Trump coined the \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" strategic concept during his first term. \n\"We fought together during World War II,\" General Romeo Brawner Jnr, the Philippines' armed forces chief of staff, said shortly after Trump was elected in November. \"Even now, as we face other threats in the region, they still continue to support us.\" \nLeaders worldwide are busy fine-tuning their strategy ahead of Trump's second term, but the activity has taken on particular urgency for those on the front lines of Beijing's growing military might. \nOfficials in Taiwan and the Philippines, facing near-daily showdowns with Beijing's powerful People's Liberation Army (PLA), suggest similar road maps for Trump 2.0 - depend less on Washington, more on themselves, appeal to his deal-making persona, and hope for the best. \nBut most of these confident statements come with a big caveat: given Trump's mercurial nature and pleasure in upending tradition, the past is no great predictor. \n\"We still need to find out what's coming,\" said Tzu-Chieh Hung, a senior analyst focused on the PLA at the Institute for National Defence and Security Research in Taiwan, which is affiliated with the island's defence ministry.  \nAt his US Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state, warned Beijing over its muscular approach.  \n\"They really need to stop messing around with Taiwan and with the Philippines, because it's forcing us to focus our attention in ways we prefer not to have to,\" Rubio said. \nMany Southeast Asian nations have traditionally looked to Washington for security protection and Beijing for trade and investment.  \nBut this fence-sitting was likely to become more difficult with US-China distrust deepening and Trump expected to demand loyalty, analysts said. \n\"Are we Team China or are we still Team US?\" said Richard Heydarian, a professorial chairholder in geopolitics at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines and adviser to President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr. \n\"We're all going to be under pressure to choose.\" \nTrump is famous for being transactional. But others could play that game, he added. \n\"If we're going to go down that road of really going to the US - and this is a cold war where we choose sides - make sure you get something in exchange economically.\" \nFor example, Heydarian said, the Philippines could position itself as part of alternate supply chains being built to bypass and otherwise \"de-risk\" trade with China.  \nOne possibility lies in nickel. The 7,641-island archipelago is the world's second-largest nickel producer, a valued commodity as countries seek to loosen Beijing's grip on strategic metals. \nAdditionally, since Manila would almost certainly be drawn into any Taiwan conflict, it could make sure that the Philippines got a piece of Taiwan's global chip business, particularly the lower-end semiconductor assembly work known as advanced packaging.  \nChina's global share of advanced packaging is around 38 per cent, according to the MIT Technology Review - a dependence that strategic competitors are seeking to reduce. \n\"We're much closer to Taiwan than any other country in the region, right? So our fates are tethered,\" Heydarian said. \"If we are going to pay the price of being part of the American geopolitical game, there has to be a benefit.\" \nThe prospect of less dependable US relations under Trump - particularly compared with President Joe Biden's keen focus on bolstering ties broadly to counter China - has both Taiwan and the Philippines looking to Japan, South Korea, European nations and each other. \nConcerns among China's neighbours have grown as its footprint expands, Beijing bolsters its nuclear arsenal, and the PLA flexes its muscle in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, where trade worth over US$3 trillion sails through annually. \n\"We need to make more friends with same-mind countries,\" said Kuan-Chen Lee, also of Taiwan's Institute for Defence and Security Research.  \n\"And secondly, Taiwan should welcome foreign investment and exchange with other countries. I believe it will make Taiwan safer.\" \nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary, and is strongly opposed to Taipei's efforts to expand its presence in global business, health and aviation forums. \nMost countries, including the US and the Philippines, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state. But Washington opposes any attempt to take the self-governed island by force, is legally bound to support Taiwan's military defence capability and has supported its bid for greater global recognition. \nTrump, with his \"America first\" stance, has repeatedly accused Washington's partners and allies of \"ripping off\" the country, especially those carrying trade surpluses or dependent on US security.  \nDuring his campaign, he took particular aim at Taiwan. \n\"I know the Taiwanese very well, I respect them a lot. They took about 100 per cent of our chip industry. I think Taiwan should pay us for defending itself,\" he said in August. \"Taiwan doesn't give us anything in return.\" \nAlexander Huang, director of international affairs at the National Policy Foundation, which is affiliated with Taiwan's main opposition party Kuomintang, said that Taipei should not think Trump was bluffing. \n\"He may not go and do exactly what he says - for instance, the 60 per cent tariff against China. But he always says Taiwanese are rich, stole our jobs, stole our chips,\" Huang said.  \n\"I don't think we can walk away without paying a price.\" \nThat price, many in Taipei and Manila suggest, may involve buying more US military hardware to address Trump's stated concerns about trade surpluses and defence costs - though given the demands of supplying arms to Ukraine and Israel, US production is years behind schedule. \nAnother problem, Hung noted, was that the maths did not add up. Trump has called on Taiwan to spend 10 per cent of its GDP on defence, a stupefying increase from its current 2.5 per cent.  \nBy comparison, European Union member countries spent some 1.6 per cent of GDP on average on defence in 2023.  \nGranted, Trump's propensity for bluster could mean that 5 per cent is the actual goal. But that would still be a stretch. Every percentage point amounts to about US$8 billion. \nNor can trade surpluses be reduced instantly. Taiwan's January-October 2024 trade surplus with the US was US$41.8 billion, up from US$35 billion for the same period in 2023. \n\"Taiwan should increase its military spending to 3 per cent of GDP from 2.5 per cent,\" Hung said. \"The question is, can we reduce the trade surplus?\" \nThe Philippines faces similar constraints - though with far smaller numbers. Manila posted a trade surplus of US$3.7 billion in the first 10 months of 2024, up slightly from US$3.5 billion for January-October 2023.  \nAnd, despite calls by Marcos to boost spending on new weapon systems, the Philippine legislature cut defence spending by 16 per cent from proposed levels, leaving it well below 1 per cent of GDP. \nBeijing bridles at the growing ties between Taiwan, the Philippines and other US allies, accusing them of encirclement, even as it makes its own assessments of the incoming Trump administration.  \nSome analysts counter, however, that Beijing's actions have driven its neighbours closer together. Taiwan has seen hundreds of menacing aircraft on its periphery, while the Philippines has witnessed huge numbers of incursions into its historical exclusive economic zone, much of which Beijing claims.  \nBeijing asserts that more than 80 per cent of the South China Sea is its sovereign territory, with the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam making competing claims. \nQuestions and insecurity about the incoming US administration have also highlighted Taipei and Manila's dependence on US military funding, which Beijing strongly opposes. \nIn 2023, the most recent figures available, US military funding for Taiwan was US$135.7 million and US$42.3 million for the Philippines.  \nIn August, Washington announced an additional US$500 million in aid to Manila for military infrastructure, troop capabilities, diplomatic initiatives and overall deterrence. \nTaiwan, at least, has seen its share of shifting political winds, its lawmakers say, and will weather the vagaries ahead. \n\"I'm not saying that the US is not important. The US is of utmost significance,\" Chen said. \"But please make sure and see that Taiwan has the confidence to defend ourselves, to defend our democratic way of life.\" \nUS-China relations, fractious during Trump's first term, have deteriorated further under Biden even as Beijing has increased pressure on Taiwan and the Philippines. And while Biden and President Xi Jinping managed to put a floor under their relations during a November 2023 summit, it remains unclear whether this will continue under Trump. \n\"Such is the deterioration of bilateral relations, that it is vital for the two countries to have clear lines of communication and well-established trust-building mechanisms as existed during the Cold War,\" said John Hemmings, a senior adviser at the Pacific Forum in Hawaii.  \nWhile Trump has been powering a more go-it-alone America, some of that shift predates him, as the US has become less willing to shoulder the responsibilities of global policeman. \n\"Some people in Taiwan, no matter who is president, are already worried whether there will be a selling out of Taiwan in the future,\" said Yeh-Chung Lu at the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy. \"More Taiwanese people are cautious that there will be some conflict across the Taiwan Strait.\" \n \"We feel very insecure,\" he added. \"China is so big. Taiwan is so small.\"\n"

    "text": "\n The latest news from the South China Sea (SCS) was that the Philippine Navy was holding exercises around Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal. This area has become a hotly-contested area between the Philippines and China.\nIn 'America and the Philippines Should Call China's Bluff,' an article last year by Marites Danguilan Vitug in Foreign Affairs, she said: '...Manila, with the support of the United States, must look beyond temporary negotiations with China and craft a longer-term approach for mitigating risks in the SCS. Marcos must calibrate his policy of transparency on Chinese provocations to spotlight Beijing's bullying tactics while also maintaining visibility front against Chinese territorial violations. And Manila must be clear on what it expects from Washington, namely, US support in routine Philippine naval activities such as supply missions in areas that fall within the country's exclusive economic zone.'\nVitug also issues a warning in the same article: 'If the United States fails to provide its ally with the necessary support, Washington and Manila may both be thrown into the kind of escalatory spiral with China that they desperately want to avoid.'\nThis article was written when Biden was still president. However, the issues that Vitug raised here have become even more relevant with the new Trump administration coming into power this week. The big question for the Philippines is what the policy of the incoming administration will be towards China and the Philippines.\nWhile president-elect Trump has not said anything regarding his policy, he did say during the campaign period that China is the main adversary of the United States. During the Cabinet confirmation hearings, the testimonies of the incoming Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the incoming National Security Council adviser Mike Waltz can give us indications of what the policies will be regarding this part of the world. Rubio said that opposing the Chinese Communist Party should be the focus of the new administration. As Secretary of State, he would likely try to strengthen US alliances in Asia to try to deter China from aggressive military action.\nHe specifically mentioned that the United States should maintain its commitments to two vital allies, namely Taiwan and the Philippines.\nSecretary Rubio, however, may have to contend with president Trump's skepticism of old allies, believing that American allies in both Europe and Asia are 'free riders' who rely too much on American military protection.\nThe confirmation hearing for the designated Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was both comical and distressing because of his ignorance. He was asked how many nations are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). His reply was that the United States has allies in Japan, South Korea and Australia. He was told by the senators that these countries were not in Southeast Asia.\nVitug in her article said that the Philippines must have a long-term strategy in dealing with China. Any long-term strategy, however, must wait until we are clear what the long-term strategy of the US under its new administration will be. One possible problem is that Trump is known to be a transactional leader and has no long-term strategy. This is the same characteristic that will make him an unpredictable president.\nIt may be advisable for the Philippine government to try and formulate a long-term independent foreign policy that will remain constant without depending on any alliance.\nThe main strength of the Marcos administration is that according to a Pulse Asia survey, 76 percent of respondents agreed that the Philippines should continue asserting the country's rights in the West Philippine Sea. In the same survey, 74 percent wanted the Philippines to work with the United States. Only 5 percent of Filipinos favored working with China.\nThe one thing that the Philippines can undertake on a long-term basis is to consolidate alliances with other countries, especially with Australia and Japan who have similar fears regarding China. Another area for developing alliances is with the other ASEAN countries, although Vitug's article sounds as if she is not confident that this can be done. According to her, some member-countries such as Cambodia and Laos are 'dependent on China for investments and aid' and are therefore 'uninterested in speaking out against Beijing.'\nIndonesia, the largest ASEAN country, is not a claimant country and has borrowed heavily from China. The Philippines' best hopes for possible alliances are Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei who also have maricreated_at disputes with China.\nSo far, President BBM has said that the Philippine red line is if a Filipino service member is killed in the WPS. This will trigger the Philippines to invoke the Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States.\nThe Philippines and China have so far avoided a major conflict by reaching several short-term deals with each other. But recent events show that China is not backing down and the Philippines under President BBM has also no intention of backing down. It is therefore necessary for the Philippines to clarify what it can expect from the United States in the event that tensions escalate in the SCS.\n"

    "text": "\n With no end in sight to China's aggressive actions in regional waters which it supports with disinformation, neighboring nations and allies that follow the rule of law should respond by further strengthening their cooperation and partnerships.\nThis was the consensus among participants of a forum on Japan-Philippines strategic cooperation last Friday organized by the Stratbase Institute.\n'If like-minded countries will cooperate against China, if all of us could enhance the level (of cooperation) against China, the cost on China will be so much. That means China will feel larger costs if they continue to adopt its aggressive attitude towards us,' China studies expert and University of Tokyo professor Dr. Shin Kawashima said.\nBeijing, he said, is expected to continue pursuing its policy of intimidation and spreading of disinformation and false narratives in asserting its illegal claims in the West Philippine Sea, Senkaku Islands and Taiwan.\n'China will not stop their operations. Maybe they will slow down temporarily but from a long-term view, China will not stop, especially given their strong strategy to go beyond the First Island Chain,' he said.\nThe Chinese, through its coast guard, escalated tensions in 2024 by firing water cannons at Philippine vessels, ramming some of them and aiming military-grade laser at their crew.\nIn one instance, China coast guard crew even boarded a Philippine boat and destroyed its navigational and communications equipment.\nIn Japan, approximately 1,300 Chinese government ships swarmed the waters surrounding the Senkaku Islands, marking a record high for the third consecutive year.\nIn the same year, over 3,000 Chinese military aircraft breached Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone, setting another new record.\nKawashima said the severity of China's possible future actions in the WPS will depend on the response of the incoming Trump administration.\n'China will experiment with the Trump administration's attitude, whether it will be hard line or soft line. If the Trump administration adopts a soft attitude, China will enact more aggressive policies,' he explained.\nStratbase president Dindo Manhit, for his part, highlighted the strategic importance of the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) between the Philippines and Japan, which was ratified by the Philippine Senate on Dec. 16.\n'The RAA sends a resounding message that the Philippines and Japan will stand resolute in the Indo-Pacific. It is crucial for the Philippines and like-minded partners, such as Japan, to deepen strategic cooperation to uphold peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific,' he pointed out.\n'Fortunately, our leaders are more engaged than ever, actively participating in dialogue, open to new agreements and committed to forging partnerships that strengthen collective efforts in addressing regional threats,' Manhit said.\nThe RAA aims to strengthen the cooperation between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and Self-Defense Forces of Japan, including by allowing the Self-Defense Forces of Japan to engage in advanced training alongside Philippine and US forces, particularly during Balikatan, Kamandag and Sama-Sama exercises.\nJapanese Ambassador Enzo Kazuya said Japan is determined to unlock the full potential of its relationship with the Philippines.\n'Once the RAA comes into effect, our level of cooperation will enter a new phase. We will continue to fortify our security and defense cooperation with allies and like-minded partners such as the US and Australia, sending a powerful message of our unwavering commitment to regional peace and stability, anchored on the rule of law,' Kazuya said.\nStronger resolve\nMeanwhile, the National Security Council (NSC) vowed to further strengthen the resolve to protect and preserve the nation's sovereignty in the WPS, following results of an OCTA Research survey, which said 84 percent of Filipinos strongly support the national government's efforts to assert its maricreated_at rights.\n'We will continue to emphasize sustainable fishing practices, marine conservation and the protection of all economic activities in the WPS, especially those of our fishermen,' National Security Adviser Eduardo Año said in a statement.\nAño noted that 'the unity and awareness shown by Filipinos across all regions, socio-economic classes and both rural and urban areas are vital as we continue to address these challenges.'\nThe national security adviser also said that such affirmation from the people reflects a shared commitment to protect the national sovereignty and territorial integrity and demonstrates a clear and widespread understanding of the issue's importance.\n'With 91 percent of Filipinos aware of the ongoing territorial disputes, it is evident that the public is not only informed but also united in supporting the country's efforts to defend its rights and interests in the WPS,' he added.\nAño stressed that in this context, it is essential to highlight that the Philippine government is acting in full accordance with both domestic and international law.\n'The Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Law and the Philippine Archipelagic Sea Lanes Law provide the legal framework through which the government asserts control over our maricreated_at zones and secures the rights of our people,' he declared.\n'These laws are aligned with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 Arbitral Ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which decisively rejected claims inconsistent with Philippine sovereignty in the South China Sea, affirming our rights to the waters, islands and resources within the West Philippine Sea. This ruling is binding under international law and remains a cornerstone of our position,' Año said.\n"

The general sense is that the world is at an inflection point. Much of the confluence of factors which have contributed to the peace and prosperity of Southeast Asia are now unravelling. Even if they are not actually unravelling, fundamental changes are occurring.\nThe first question is, what are these factors that have contributed to our peace and prosperity?\nNumber one, in Southeast Asia, for the past couple of decades we have had a stable balance of power. We have had peace. We were able to focus on economic development rather than on strategic or military issues. Number two, we have had a system of global economic integration, characterised by free trade, the growth of multinational corporations, their investments, and the development of global supply chains, which in turn have provided opportunities for many Southeast Asian nations to industrialise and to be part of this global network of supply chains. Further to that, we have also in the past few decades, witnessed a world in which tariff and non-tariff barriers have been coming down, and all this has been conducive to global trade.\nNow, this confluence of factors is unravelling. First, we are now moving into a world in which there will be greater contestation, not just between superpowerbut between middle powers and hot spots. (There will also be) active conflicts in parts of the world. In the last few years, we have seen conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza, and tensions in the South China Sea.\nSecond, we are also seeing a world in which there has been a pushback against free trade and economic integration. (It is now) a more protectionist and nationalistic world. This, obviously, is anathema to the development model which Southeast Asia has embarked on.\nThird, the United Nations, not just as a political convening point for all countries in the world, but also its ability to focus on the issues affecting the global commons. For instance, the Paris Agreement, The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) the Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement), which was presided by Ambassador Rena Lee. This ability to provide global public goods, and to generate consensus is weakening. The conflicts in the last couple of years, in fact, are symptoms of this greater underlying dysfunction.\nThe next question that arises is - what does ASEAN do about all this? I would say there are some preliminary conclusions. First is that ASEAN needs to double down on ASEAN integration, because ASEAN cannot control the agendas of the superpowers, or indeed the larger powers. But we can, and we should focus on integrating ourselves, strengthening our economies, and our connectivity.\nSpecifically in this conference, what we discussed first is how we look forward to upgrading the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA).\nSecondly, to upgrade existing free trade agreements with China, the Republic of Korean (ROK) and India. But beyond free trade agreements, to also explore new multilateral agreements. For instance, we are also negotiating the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement, which will enable us to harvest the new and emerging opportunities that the digital technologies provide. Beyond agreements, we are also looking at concrete things on the ground. For instance, the ASEAN Power Grid, which would interconnect the energy systems across ASEAN. This will enable a more stable and a more cost-effective way of making that transition into both energy efficiency as well as green and sustainable energy, but it requires a multilateral, forward looking and long-term vision to achieve. All these are examples of what ASEAN can do to increase trade, investments and connectivity within ASEAN itself. So that is the first theme - ASEAN integration.\nThe second theme that we discussed was the convening ability of ASEAN. For instance, the East Asia Summit, which occurs every year at the ASEAN Summit. ASEAN is at the centre of it. We engage not only the larger powers, but also middle powers. Virtually everyone who has a stake and is relevant to ASEAN is represented, and we look forward to this meeting that will be chaired by Malaysia as Chairman of ASEAN, to be able to generate some form of consensus and alignment amongst ASEAN and all our major economic partners. That is the second aspect.\nThe third is a more intangible but no less important point, which is that as the old structures underpinning the global strategic geopolitical architecture get eroded, it is important for ASEAN to maintain its unity, its cohesion, its adherence to principles and to international law, and to engage with all the major powers in an omnidirectional, principled, deliberate and careful way. Careful so that we do not become entangled in super power contestation, but at the same created_at, we maximise our strategic latitude, our right to choose our own destinies, and to do so by making common cause by adherence to long-held principles which lead to fairer, equitable and constructive outcomes for all of us. That is what I mean by an omnidirectional engagement of the rest of the world.\nThe fourth aspect is, for ASEAN to do all this, we also need to look into our own backyard. Unfortunately, the problems in Myanmar are nowhere near resolution. Actually, there has been no progress, and we have reaffirmed the centrality of the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus. Myanmar remains an integral member of ASEAN, but it needs to sort itself out. It needs national reconciliation. To the extent that ASEAN can act as a convener for all the different stakeholders in Myanmar to come together, we will seek national reconciliation in a long standing, fair and forward looking way. Then Myanmar can come together and get on this bandwagon, and we can hopefully safely navigate this emerging world. All in all, this was a very good, very candid, open and constructive meeting the past two days in Langkawi.\nNoah Kong (CNA TV): I would like to ask a bit more about what you mentioned, about nationalism and protectionism and the broader trend in the world. Can you elaborate on ASEAN's strategy to adapt to these global dynamics in the year ahead? And should we be concerned about protectionism, even within ASEAN?\nMinister: First, you need to take a step back and understand that all over the world, free trade on its own and taken to extremes without adequate attention to social safety nets, without attention to your citizens, skills, education and capability to take on new jobs. If you do not have your social and your educational and your economic agendas in sync, you will then get problems and you will get a domestic pushback. And this, in fact, is what is happening in many parts of the world. So, it is important not to just be upset about the rise of nationalism or the pushback against global trade, but to try to understand that point.\nAnd then domestically, as in the case of Singapore, we are focusing on Skills Future, on improving and always evolving our education system. We are focusing on jobs and making sure that whilst you cannot stop the progress of technology and you cannot stop economic transformation, this has to be accompanied, hand in hand, with making sure our people are ready and prepared for the new jobs and have sufficient assurances from the social security safety nets that they will get through this transformation. So that is the first thing. It is domestic.\nDo I anticipate a rise in nationalism and anti-trade sencreated_atnt within ASEAN? I think I am a lot more hopeful. Within ASEAN, first of all, all of us know that we are part of a global supply chain, and if we were to erect barriers either against the world or against each other, this will be a lose-lose proposition. So, I am confident that the leadership across all ASEAN countries understands what is in the long-term interest, and that we will therefore focus on uplifting the capacity of our people, and this will give us the ability to continue integrating and making the overall ASEAN economy more efficient and to grow as quickly as possible.\nI should add that, despite all the anxieties at the global economy level, the prospects for the ASEAN economy still remain good in terms of our growth potential. Not just over one year or two years, but over the next two three decades. If you add up the combined GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of ASEAN, we should be able to get to number four or number five within the next two decades or so, on a global stage.\nIf you look even in terms of trading patterns, if you ask China who is your largest trading partner, you will see that ASEAN has overtaken the US and the EU. So, my point is, in the case of ASEAN, we have had good growth in the past three decades. We anticipate good growth for the next couple of decades, so long as there is peace and so long as the world does not completely fracture, and so long as we maximise space for us to grow economically, to grow together, and to grow a collective as ASEAN.\nSeoow Juin Yee (Lianhe Zaobao): Minister, what is Singapore's perspective on ASEAN's collective approach to the Myanmar issue, particularly in light of the fact that some of the member states independently engage with Myanmar's military government. And in your view, can Malaysia's chairmanship achieve tangible progress in this regard?\nMinister:I will put it this way-we all have a stake in Myanmar's stability, peace, and reconciliation. Having said that, some members of ASEAN, for instance, their immediate neighbours, have greater vulnerabilities to instability, violence, drug trafficking, illegal activities, and even the outflow of refugees. So, the vulnerabilities may differ across ASEAN.\nBut the larger point is that all of us want to achieve national reconciliation within Myanmar through a Myanmar-owned and Myanmar-led process. None of us want to interfere in the internal affairs of our fellow ASEAN member. So, in that respect, the more channels of communication and the more potential arenas for all the different stakeholders in Myanmar to come together, the better. I do not look at all these efforts to maintain communications, to open new channels and to convene the different stakeholders together, separately. These are not mutually exclusive. In fact, the more the better.\nAmir Yusof (CNA Digital):In the pursuit of joining BRICS, some ASEAN countries have forged closer ties with the likes of Russia, China and the Global South. Given the context of the global geopolitical tensions that you spoke about, should Singapore be concerned with these developments?\nMinister:Again, let us try to understand why over the last few years you have seen the growth of BRICS. You have seen AUKUS and the Quad develop, and a variety of other regional and sub-regional architecture. Basically, this is a period of uncertainty, and countries are trying to expand their networks, build new opportunities economically, make more friends and hedge or keep their options open. So, that is why you are seeing this proliferation of new or expanding architectures.\nFrom Singapore's point of view, we have good relations with all the members of these new architectures. The second point is that Singapore takes memberships, commitments, responsibilities and liabilities very seriously. So, my attitude to BRICS and other emerging architectures is to keep an open mind. I would first assess whether there is strategic coherence behind these groupings. What is their alignment? What do they stand for? What is on their agenda? Does this promote peace and prosperity? And to the extent that they do, and where the agendas overlap, Singapore will be quite happy to work with them, either in groups or even bilaterally. (Singapore will) keep an open mind and continue to keep monitoring strategic and economic coherence.\nBeyond that, we are looking to make friends and common cause with as wide a spectrum as possible. Not just with people, but with as many states as possible. But this kind of engagement cannot be based on an enforced agreement or being forced to choose sides for or against any party. As I mentioned earlier, we believe in an omnidirectional engagement of all strategic stakeholders at a global level.\nMy bottom line is, we keep our options open. We are not against the emergence of these groupings and where possible, if we can work together with them, we will happily do so. As for membership, we will have to look far more carefully before we sign on to anything.\nTan Min-Wei (Mothership): Is Singapore's, and to a certain extent, the whole of ASEAN's, commitment to the ASEAN Power Grid a vote of confidence in the long-term stability of ASEAN states, and that situations like Myanmar represent an aberration?\nMinister: I certainly hope situations like Myanmar will be an aberration, for the future of ASEAN. But let us set that one aside temporarily, and ask ourselves, what does the development of an ASEAN Power Grid portend?\nFirst, if ASEAN economies were not growing, we would not need to do this. Second, we all have a collective commitment to make the system for the electrical grid more stable, cost-effective, and green. We know that in designing these systems, the more you can raft different systems together, carefully and in a structured way, the better.\nThird, it also gives ASEAN another opportunity to prove that a collective approach to getting things done and long-term projects which require confidence in the future, and which require governments to have reliable, long-term, stable regulatory regimes as well as good diplomatic and economic ties, both bilaterally and multilaterally, (works). So that is why I view this as an important icon of ASEAN integration and of ASEAN's potential for the future.\nI could give you another example. For instance, we all know in Singapore, we have digital payment systems such as FAST, PayNow. You may also be aware that, in fact, we have already linked our digital payment systems to Malaysia. They call it, DuitNow. With Thailand, there is PromptPay, and with India, through their UPI (Unified Payments Interface) system. The project which we are now working on is called Project Nexus, which, will facilitate the easier onboarding of other countries for them to interconnect their digital payment systems. So again here, I think it is no accident that for cross border digital payments, ASEAN is taking the lead. Our pioneering work in linking our payment systems to Thailand, Malaysia, India- Indonesia is also watching this space very closely- is another example of how ASEAN integration can often be a nucleus and a working prototype of the future. So, I remain optimistic. I believe that these projects are important. I am not going to trivialise and say that these are simple and easy to execute both over one or two years, but the strategic direction is clear, and to the extent that these ASEAN meetings and summits maintain alignment and a confluence of interest at the highest level within our ASEAN countries, I think this is a good sign.\nTan Tam Mei (Straits created_ats): In the context of incoming US President Mr Trump, who is talking about protectionist policies, and tariffs. Is ASEAN ready to deal with this shift by a key partner, and is there anything that is going to change about ASEAN priorities and strategies?\nMinister: Well, like I said just now, I always resist oversimplifying other countries' responses. And as I said, you first have to ask yourself why America is apparently changing direction, and as I have alluded to earlier, it has got to do with their own domestic sense of opportunity, fairness and preparedness for the future.\nAmerica has to sort out its own domestic political policy arrangements in order for it to have the confidence to deal with the rest of the world the way it has very generously done for 80 years, since the end of the Second World War. We should not get into a labelling or pejorative exercise. President Trump will be inaugurated tomorrow. We look forward to his inauguration, and to the policies, and we will have to make the necessary adjustments even as he makes changes to his policies.\nBut the key point I am making is that ASEAN will continue to double down on our own integration, enhance our own trade and investment environment within ASEAN, enhance our own connectivity, and make ASEAN as competitive as possible, as a trading partner, as an investment destination, or even as an investment source. (These can be achieved) by having long-term policies which are consistent, which are reliable, which are trustworthy, and to keep open engagements in an inclusive way with all the major powers- America, China, Europe, India, Japan.\nAnd you will notice increasingly, particularly in the case of Singapore, we are paying attention to Africa and to South America, as well as establishing free trade arrangements, with MERCOSUR with the Pacific Alliance. In these places, their governments have a very wide diversity of economic perspectives from hard right to hard left. But you notice, even in those cases, they are open to, and they are keen to build economic ties with us in Singapore and in ASEAN.\nThe point is the world is changing. The changes start at home. These domestic changes will have an impact on foreign policy, and it is important in the conduct of foreign policy not to rush to judgment, to stay calm, stay consistent, be constructive, be open and be inclusive. I am convinced that these will be the attributes of our approach, even as the world goes through this inflection point.\nTan Tam Mei (Straits created_ats): A quick question about the issue of cross border crimes like online scam. Has it been discussed?\nMinister: In the past and even now, there is worry about the opium triangle. Drugs unfortunately, are still a clear and present threat. But beyond drugs, (there are) now scams and other crimes will take advantage of interconnected digital economies. And again, this illustrates, just as it is in the case of drug trafficking, the need for a collective approach. Of course, we are far stricter about these things in Singapore, but Singapore also has to work with all our partners. So, that is the other reason why you need to have stability across every single member of ASEAN. Otherwise, you will have pockets where criminal syndicates can park themselves and from wherever they are, they can do a lot of harm to our people. Again, (we need to) work together and work in an open and inclusive way.\nSabrina Ng (CNA TV): Given that it is the 60th anniversary of ASEAN in two years, and it is the year that Singapore is chairing, what are Singapore's plans or area of focus for its championship?\nMinister: That is two years from now. I am not in a position to say what our themes would be, but as you would have ascertained from my comments in the last few minutes, I think some things are going to keep us occupied for probably the next decade. As I have said, (these include) integration, trade, investments, digitalisation, interconnectivity and keeping ASEAN competitive, relevant, and having a place at the main table, and to engage in a way in which we are taken seriously and relevant to global community. These may sound aspirational, and honestly, it is not something you can take for granted. I am not setting an agenda for 2027 when we will chair ASEAN, but I am saying that these are issues we need to think through carefully and to work on closely and collaboratively with our partners in ASEAN.\n[Category: Events]\nSource: Ministry of Foreign Affairs,Government of Singapore\n"

    "text": "\nU.S. Navy and the Philippine Navy conducted a joint Maricreated_at Cooperative Activity (MCA) while transiting the South China Sea, underscoring the growing strategic partnership between the two nations. This operation saw a formation of significant naval assets from both countries, including the U.S. Navys Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70), and key vessels from the Philippine Navy, such as the Jose Rizal-class frigate BRP Antonio Luna (FF 151). The exercise also involved the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Sterett (DDG 104) and the Ticonderoga-class cruiser USS Princeton (CG 59) from the U.S. Navy, as well as the Philippine Navys Gregorio del Pilar-class offshore patrol vessel BRP Andrs Bonifacio (PS 17).\nThis joint exercise highlights the continuing effort to strengthen the operational integration of the U.S. and Philippine navies. The MCA focuses on refining joint tactics, enhancing interoperability, and bolstering the effectiveness of both forces in responding to emerging challenges in the South China Sea. Through synchronized drills, maneuvers, and real-created_at coordination, the two nations worked to enhance their combined maricreated_at capabilities, ensuring they can seamlessly operate together in future contingencies. \"The Maricreated_at Cooperative Activity is a vital part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen maricreated_at security and readiness in the Indo-Pacific,\" said a senior U.S. Navy official. \"It is a clear demonstration of the commitment between the U.S. and the Philippines to maintain a free and open maricreated_at environment.\"\nThe South China Sea remains one of the most strategically vital waterways in the world. It is a major international shipping route, with an estimated $3.4 trillion worth of goods passing through annually, and rich in natural resources, including oil and gas reserves. In fact, approximately one-third of global maricreated_at trade, including energy shipments, passes through these waters. This makes it a crucial chokepoint for global commerce. Additionally, the region is home to valuable undersea mineral deposits and potential energy resources that are contested by several nations, notably China, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia.\nHowever, it is also a flashpoint for geopolitical tension due to competing territorial claims, particularly over the Spratly Islands and Paracel Islands. The ongoing militarization of artificial islands by China, with military installations, airstrips, and radar systems, has heightened concerns among other regional players. This has led to growing anxiety over the potential for conflict, as nations in the region, including the Philippines, seek to safeguard their maricreated_at rights and access to resources. For the U.S. and its allies, maintaining patrols and control over the South China Sea is vital not only for securing critical sea lanes but also for asserting international law and ensuring the region remains free from coercive actions by any single power.\nBy conducting this Maricreated_at Cooperative Activity in the heart of the South China Sea, the U.S. and the Philippines reaffirmed their commitment to upholding international maricreated_at law and ensuring that this critical global trade route remains open and free from coercion. This exercise not only boosts the bilateral ties between the two nations but also sends a strong signal to regional actors that both nations stand united against any attempts to disrupt the freedom of navigation in the area. Patrol and control of the South China Sea is essential for ensuring that no single country can unilaterally impose its will over international waters or impede global trade.\nThe exercise also aims to increase operational readiness in complex maricreated_at environments. Both the U.S. and Philippine forces have been working closely to enhance their joint training programs, allowing for improved coordination in future operations. Such activities range from humanitarian aid missions to potential maricreated_at security interventions. This MCA provided an opportunity for U.S. and Philippine naval forces to engage in a variety of real-world tactical operations, including formation sailing, communication procedures, and defense drills. The U.S. Navys Carrier Strike Group ONE, which is currently conducting routine operations in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations, served as a key asset during this exercise, showcasing the extensive capabilities of the U.S. naval forces.\nThe exercise is part of a broader U.S.-Philippine defense collaboration that has been growing in importance over the years. With the increasing militarization of the South China Sea by China and ongoing territorial disputes, it is more critical than ever for the U.S. and the Philippines to present a united front. The MCA reflects the shared strategic goals of both nations, particularly in securing a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific region. The presence of both U.S. and Philippine warships in the South China Sea also reaffirms the enduring strength of the mutual defense agreement between the two countries. This exercise plays an essential role in promoting peace and stability in the region, emphasizing the commitment of both nations to ensuring the security of the Indo-Pacific.\nThe Maricreated_at Cooperative Activity conducted on January 17, 2025, between the U.S. Navy and the Philippine Navy marks another significant step in the strengthening of bilateral defense ties. Through this exercise, both navies have enhanced their readiness, interoperability, and tactical effectiveness while further affirming their commitment to preserving peace and security in the South China Sea. As regional tensions persist, these joint operations are a testament to the unwavering partnership between the U.S. and the Philippines and their shared resolve to maintain a free, open, and secure maricreated_at environment.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines and the US held joint maricreated_at exercises for a fifth created_at in the South China Sea, Manila’s armed forces said on Sunday, in a move that could irk China.\nThe Philippine military said in a statement it held a “maricreated_at cooperative activity” with the US on Friday and Saturday, its first for the year and fifth overall since launching the joint activities in 2023.\nSecurity engagements between the two allies have soared under Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., who has pivoted closer to Washington, allowing the expansion of military bases that American forces can access, including facilities that face Taiwan.\nThe joint maricreated_at activity included the US’ Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group, two guided missile destroyers, two helicopters and two F-18 Hornet aircraft.\nThe Philippine side deployed its Antonio Luna frigate, Andres Bonifacio patrol ship, two FA-50 fighter jets and search and rescue assets of the air force.\nThe activities “reinforced bilateral maricreated_at cooperation and interoperability,” the Philippine armed forces said.\nTheir joint activity came at a created_at when the Philippines had called out China over the presence of Chinese coast guard vessels inside its maricreated_at zone, including the 165-meter-long ship that it describes as “the monster” for its size.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond for a request for comment at the weekend.\nMeanwhile, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vowed to prevent China from normalizing its ship deployments within Manila’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea.\nIn a statement on Saturday night, the agency said its vessel BRP Gabriela Silang was “actively monitoring and challenging the unlawful presence” of Chinese Coast Guard vessel 5901 or its so-called monster ship.\nThe monster ship was last seen 60-70 nautical miles from the Zambales coastline, it said.\nThe PCG crew conducted a radio challenge to remind the Chine Coast Guard of their “unlawful actions, particularly regarding their claims of conducting maricreated_at patrols.”\nThe 83-meter French-built BRP Gabriela Silang was “boldly asserting its stance against any attempts to legitimize illegal activities in the West Philippine Sea,” the PCG said, referring to parts of the South China Sea within the Philippine EEZ.\n“By confronting the presence of Chinese Coast Guard vessel 5901, the PCG sends a clear message: the normalization of unlawful deployments will not be accepted or tolerated,” it added.\nThe PCG noted that under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, freedom of navigation for foreign-flagged vessels does not extend to patrols within the EEZ of other states.\n“The PCG stands firm in its dedication to ensuring that no unlawful actions by the China Coast Guard in the West Philippine Sea go unchallenged.”\nThe Philippines last week accused China of intimidating Filipino fishermen near Scarborough Shoal and normalizing its “illegal presence” after Beijing sent its biggest coast guard ship into the Philippine EEZ.\nThe monster ship was first spotted within the Philippine EEZ on Jan. 4, prompting the dispatch of the PCG’s largest ship.\nA United Nations-backed tribunal based in the Hague in 2016 voided China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea for being illegal, as it ruled Scarborough Shoal, which Beijing has controlled since 2012, is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen.\nThe shoal, which Manila calls Bajo de Masinloc, is 241 kilometers off Zambales and is within the Philippines’ 200-nautical mile EEZ.\nPCG spokesman Jay Tristan Tarriela last week said the monster ship’s presence near the Zambales coast could not be considered an innocent passage and does not fall under the principle of freedom of navigation because its movement is “not continuous and it is not expeditious.”\n“Meaning, it has erratic movements — somecreated_ats it goes up, goes down, turns left, turns right arbitrarily.

    "text": "\nPhilippine officials have suggested that, in the face of grave aggression from China in the South China Sea, new legal action is not a matter of if, but when.\nJonathan Malaya, assistant director-general of the National Security Council, told a press briefing this week that, being pushed to the wall, Manila is considering all options including new international lawsuits.In 2013, the Philippines filed an arbitration case against China under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, the first created_at any nation had challenged China over its maricreated_at claims.\nKnown as PCA Case No. 2013-19, it ended in 2016 in victory for the Philippines, with the arbitral tribunal ruling in favor of the Philippines on most of its submissions and rejecting China's claim of historic rights to vast areas in the South China Sea using the so-called nine-dash line on its maps.\nNearly 10 years on, China still refuses to accept the ruling despite it being final and binding for all parties concerned.\nDuterte renews efforts\nUnder former President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines and China appeared to have shelved the tribunal's decision, a loss of opportunity to those who wanted to promote a new legal framework for the South China Sea.\nYet there have been constant calls on the Philippine government since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took power to renew efforts to reinforce the ruling, including by filing new cases.\nI have recommended the filing of the following cases before an UNCLOS tribunal, said former Justice Antonio Carpio, part of the legal team that defended the Philippines' case in 2016. The first is compulsory arbitration over the overlapping claims in the continental shelf beyond the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines in the Spratlys.\nUNCLOS determines that a littoral country's exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, measures 200 nautical miles from the shore and the continental shelf may extend beyond the EEZ.\nThe second case is compulsory arbitration for damages arising from the ramming by Chinese coast guard vessels of Philippine coast guard vessels, Carpio told Radio Free Asia, referring to a number of serious incidents over the last few years near disputed reefs including Sabina Shoal and Scarborough Shoal.\nAnd the third case is compulsory arbitration to establish the rules to govern fishing in Scarborough Shoal which the 2016 tribunal declared is a historic fishing ground of Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen, Carpio added.\nChina, which took de-facto control of Scarborough Shoal in 2012, has been accused of blocking Philippine ships from accessing the area and harassing them. The world's largest coast guard vessel 5901, China's 'Monster', has been operating inside the Philippines' EEZ almost constantly since the beginning of the year to exert control over the Scarborough Shoal area.\nSupport for UNCLOS\nBuilding upon the 2016 ruling under UNCLOS may be a smart move that could garner international support but a maricreated_at expert suggested that making greater use of the United Nations would expand Philippine options for arbitration.\nGreg Poling, director of the Asia Maricreated_at Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, wrote in a recent article that even though the U.N. cannot compel China to comply with the 2016 arbitral award the General Assembly would be able to pass nonbinding resolutions and, most importantly, forward the matter to the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion.\nPoling suggested that the Philippines could file with the General Assembly a resolution demanding compliance with the 2016 arbitration, which it would win. It could also file another resolution seeking an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on issues such as whether China's behavior violates international treaties, and it could win that, too.\nHe argued that repeated losses in different international bodies would raise the costs of noncompliance and make a face-saving compromise progressively more attractive for China.\nInternational law is not self-enforcing, Poling said, adding that an arbitral victory is only useful if it could be used to rally international support, impose costs, and eventually compel at least partial compliance by the wrongdoing party.\nWe have thought about submitting a resolution before the U.N. General Assembly, said former Justice Antonio Carpio. This needs prior lobbying for votes.\nIt would be reckless to ask for a U.N. General Assembly vote unless you have a headcount of how many votes you will get, the legal expert said.\nBut that's when the Philippines' ally the United States and like-minded nations could come to its support, said Greg Poling.\nThe U.S. should lobby other states to vote with the Philippines, he told RFA.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "text": "\nManila, Jan. 20 -- Maricreated_at cooperation among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) might help conclude a binding Code of Conduct (COC) in the disputed South China Sea region, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Secretary Enrique Manalo said.\nDFA Secretary Enrique Manalo at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Retreat held in Langkawi, Malaysia on Jan. 19, 2025. (Photo from Manalo via X post)\nIn a video interview posted by Free Malaysia Today, which was shared by the DFA to the Philippine media, the secretary explained why ASEAN members must be free to enter into enhanced cooperation with each other as this will also be for the betterment of China.\n\"We have the basic negotiations between the ASEAN countries and China but I think this doesn't prevent other countries from seeking maricreated_at cooperative activities with each other, because that, too, will help even with China,\" he said.\n\"So, all of these (efforts) could work and be supportive of the negotiations of the Code of Conduct. So, I would not look at things as alternatives to the code,\" he stressed.\nWhile the 2012 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) reaffirmed ASEAN's and China's commitment to the adoption of the more binding COC to promote peace and stability in the contested region, negotiations for the COC that began in 2018 have been derailed because of disagreements on the Code's geographical scope and the involvement of external powers.\nBut Manalo, who was in Langkawi, Malaysia over the weekend for the ASEAN Foreign Ministers Retreat, believed that \"countries could find ways to address the situation in the South China Sea.\"\n\"Whatever way works, I think they should be promoted,\" the official added.\nThe Philippines has been pushing for the conclusion of the Code, with President Marcos calling for speedy COC negotiations during the 27th ASEAN-China Summit in Laos last October 2024.\nThis came amid China's increasingly aggressive stance in the resource-rich region, asserting territorial and maricreated_at claims that overlap with the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of the Philippines, Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia.\nMeanwhile, Manalo also shared on X (formerly Twitter) about his attendance to the ASEAN Foreign Ministers Retreat, the first meeting under Malaysia's chairmanship.\n\"We had good discussions on international developments including the situation in Myanmar, South China Sea, and the Middle East and addressing regional and international issues such as climate change and transnational crimes,\" he wrote.\n\"Looking forward to more productive and meaningful engagements with Malaysia under its Chairmanship theme 'Inclusivity and Sustainability',\" he added.\nThe DFA chief also shared photos of the meeting, including one that was seemingly taken during a reception held in honor of the foreign ministers.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

    "text": "\nSenior Philippine diplomats confronted Chinese counterparts in face-to-face talks about China's monster coast guard ship intruding into Manila's territorial waters, as the two sides met to discuss the hot-button issue of the South China Sea.\nForeign Affairs Undersecretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro led the Philippine delegation in the 10th Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea, or BCM, which took place on Thursday in the Chinese city of Xiamen.\nChinese Vice Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong headed the Chinese delegation in the BCM, a series of bilateral talks that were started in 2017 with the aim of lowering tensions between the two countries - rival claimants - over the contested waterway.\nThe Philippine side expressed serious concern about the presence and activities of China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels lately within Manila's exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, including the 12,000-ton ship, dubbed The Monster.\nCCG 5901, the world's largest coast guard ship, had been spotted patrolling the resource-rich Scarborough Shoal area in recent days and waters off the coast of Luzon, the main island in the Philippines.\nManila had already lodged protests and diplomatic complaints about the ship's intimidating presence in Philippine-claimed waters.\nEarlier this week, a Philippine National Security official said China was pushing us to the wall as he indicated that Manila was considering pursuing a new lawsuit against Beijing over the South China Sea.\nWhile CCG 5901 had not carried out any dangerous maneuvers so far, Philippine officials said its activities within Manila's waters were not backed by any international law, according to a statement from the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs.\nOur position is clear and consistent, but so is our willingness to engage in dialogue. We firmly believe that despite the unresolved challenges and differences, there is genuine space for diplomatic and pragmatic cooperation in dealing with our issues in the South China Sea, the statement quoted Lazaro as saying at the meeting.\nChina's actions were inconsistent with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, which both Manila and Beijing had signed, and the recently passed Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, according to the Philippine foreign office.\nBeijing earlier said that the presence of its ships in Scarborough was fully justified, reiterating its jurisdiction over the shoal.\nWe call on the Philippines once again to immediately stop all infringement activities, provocations and false accusations, and stop all its actions that jeopardize peace and stability and complicate the situation in the South China Sea, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Tuesday.\nLocated about 125 nautical miles (232 km) from Luzon island, Scarborough Shoal - known as Bajo de Masinloc in the Philippines - has been under China's de facto control since 2012.\nBeijing's possession of the shoal forced Manila to file a lawsuit at the world court in The Hague.\nFour years later, an international arbitration tribunal ruled in Manila's favor but Beijing has never acknowledged that decision, insisting on its historical claims over the waterway.\nAnother flashpoint\nAt Thursday's meeting, the two sides also agreed to keep implementing a provisional understanding regarding Philippine resupply missions to the BRP Sierra Madre, a decrepit World War II-era military ship stationed in Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal, another disputed South China Sea feature.\nCCG vessels had been regularly blocking Philippine ships carrying supplies and troops to the shoal. But the two countries arrived at a provisional agreement in July, following a dramatic standoff the previous month between Filipino servicemen and CCG personnel at Second Thomas Shoal, during which a Philippine serviceman lost a finger.\nPhilippine and Chinese officials, however, have not yet publicly disclosed the official document of the agreement or its details, with both sides making their own claims about the deal's contents.\nAt the talks on Thursday, both sides acknowledged the deal's positive outcomes and agreed to continue its implementation to sustain the de-escalation of tensions without prejudice to respective national positions, Manila's foreign office said.\nBoth sides also agreed to reinvigorate the platform for coast guard cooperation but no specific details were provided.\nIn 2016, under then-President Rodrigo Duterte who adopted a pro-Beijing policy, the two nations' coast guards formed the Joint Coast Guard Committee (JCGC), establishing a hotline between the two maricreated_at law enforcement agencies.\nIn January 2023, amid increasing tensions in the disputed waters, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to set up a communication line between their foreign ministries.\nBut a few months later, Manila officials said that China could not be reached in created_ats of high tensions at sea.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "text": "\nMANILA — Malaysia is committed to addressing regional issues, but expectations on Myanmar and the advancing of talks on a code of conduct between the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and China for the South China Sea should be tempered, its foreign minister said on Sunday.\n“To say that we will have a solution immediately is going to be very ambitious,” Malaysian Foreign Ministry secretary general Amran Mohamed Zin told a media briefing ahead of the closed-door retreat among Asean foreign ministers on Langkawi island.\nMalaysia is hosting its first meeting as chair of the regional bloc which is dealing with Beijing’s aggression in the South China Sea and a faltering Asean peace process for Myanmar, where the ruling military plans to hold an election this year.\nREAD: More Asean nations offer help on South China Sea issue\nEach Asean member state has a role to play in ensuring the South China Sea is a “sea of peace and trade,” Amran said, adding that tentative progress has been made toward creating a code of conduct with China, which claims sovereignty over most of the strategic waterway.\nThe South China Sea, a conduit for about $3 trillion of annual ship-borne trade, has been the site of heated standoffs in the past two years between Asean member nation, the Philippines, and China, a major source of the region’s trade and investment.\nTrickier issues\nOn Saturday, Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo said that while discussions on a code of conduct between Asean and China were well underway, it was created_at to start thrashing out the meatier, trickier aspects.\n“It’s created_at that we try to look at issues which are, in our view, essential, which have not really been discussed in a thorough way or even much less negotiated. These are the so-called milestone issues,” said Manalo.\nThose would include the code’s scope, whether it is legally binding and its impact on third-party countries, he said, adding the aim was to make it effective and substantive.\n“We have to begin addressing these important issues,” Manalo added. “This might be the best way to at least move the negotiation forward.”\nBoth Asean and Beijing pledged in 2002 to create a code of conduct, but took 15 years to start discussions and progress has been slow.\nVietnam and Malaysia have also made protests over the conduct of Chinese vessels in their exclusive economic zones (EEZs).\nBeijing insists it is operating lawfully in its territory and does not recognize a 2016 arbitration ruling that said its claim has no basis under international law.\nMyanmar issue\nMyanmar has been in turmoil since early 2021 when its military overthrew an elected civilian government, triggering prodemocracy protests that morphed into a widening armed rebellion that has taken over swathes of the country.\nDespite being battered on multiple front lines, its economy in tatters and dozens of political parties banned, the junta is pushing to hold an election this year, which critics have widely derided as a sham to keep the military in power through proxies.\nAsean has so far failed to implement a “Five-Point Consensus” peace plan unveiled months after the coup, which prescribes dialogue and an end to hostilities, and it has yet to discuss a common position on the election.\n“Everytext wants to help Myanmar … engagements have happened and will continue under Malaysia’s chairmanship,” Amran said.\nManalo said the civil war in Myanmar remains a big challenge for Asean, which has barred the generals from meetings for failing to implement the bloc’s peace plan.\nHe added that it was premature to discuss if Asean would make preconditions for recognizing the election, which he said must involve as much of the population as possible.\n“If elections are held without being seen as inclusive, not transparent, I believe it would be very difficult for those elections to create more legitimacy,” Manalo said.\nWarning to China\nA House lawmaker, meanwhile, welcomed US Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio’s stance against Chinese aggression in the West Philippine Sea, saying it should serve as a warning against China’s “continuing disrespect” of the sovereignty of both the Philippines and Taiwan.\nSurigao del Norte Rep. Robert Ace Barbers said Rubio’s statements should deter China’s bullying and harassment of Filipino fishermen within the country’s 322-kilometer (200-mile) EEZ.\nRubio, who appeared last week before the US Senate foreign relations committee for his nomination as state secretary, discouraged China from doing “anything rash or irrational” when it came to the Philippines or Taiwan if it was serious about stabilizing its relations with the United States.\nHe said that should any “miscommunication” or “inadvertent conflict” arise from China’s aggression in the West Philippine Sea, the United States could be compelled to defend the Philippines as a treaty ally which would have a huge global impact.\n“It’s pleasing to hear and learn that the incoming US secretary of state has a deep knowledge of China’s atrocities in the West Philippine Sea and against Taiwan and that they are prepared to assist should any untoward incident happen,” Barbers said. —with a report from Jeannette I.

    "text": "\nNew satellite imagery shows the Philippines continuing to monitor China's presence in its maricreated_at zone, including the movements of a colossal Chinese coast guard (CCG) ship nicknamed the \"Monster.\"\nNewsweek reached out to the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Philippines coast guard (PCG) with emailed requests for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nThe Philippines has long complained about CCG activity within its exclusive economic zone. Newsweek's map (below), based on self-reported GPS data captured by the Global Fishing Watch website, shows the movements of the large vessel inside the Philippines EEZ but outside of its territorial sea, which typically extends 12 nautical miles from the coast.\nInternational maricreated_at law grants coastal states an EEZ extending up to 200 nautical miles (230 miles), under which they enjoy a sovereign right to underwater resources. Any country is permitted to sail its ships through the EEZ of another nation, but Manila says Beijing's loitering and patrols, hundreds of miles from its shores, are a breach of the norm.\nWhat To Know\n\"Today marks the 16th day of the China Coast Guard's illegal deployment of its vessel off the coast of Zambales,\" Philippine coast guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela wrote Monday on X (formerly Twitter). Zambales is a province in the Philippines' Central Luzon region.\nTarriela lauded the \"brave men and women of the Philippine coast guard\" who have continued to broadcast radio challenges to and shadow the Chinese vessels.\nThese include one of the world's two biggest coast guard ships, CGG-5901—or the \"Monster.\" Displacing 12,000 tons and running 540 feet from bow to stern, it dwarfs its Philippine counterparts.\nThe \"Monster\" has been operating in the Philippine EEZ for most of the nearly three weeks since it set sail from China's Hainan province.\nThe Global Fishing Watch data showed the behemoth inching closer to the Philippines last week. On Sunday, it switched off its automatic identification system—an action out of line with International Maricreated_at Organization safety protocols. This makes it harder to detect.\nPhotos captured by European Space Agency satellites, however, showed it continuing its patrol within the EEZ, with Philippine coast guard cutter BRP Gabriela Silang less than 700 meters (2,297 feet) away.\nCGC-5901 was situated some 95 nautical miles (109 miles) off Zambales as of Sunday at 9 p.m., Tarriela said.\nThe U.S. Navy issued a statement Saturday saying its Carrier Strike Group 1, led by the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier the Carl Vinson, had concluded two days of joint exercises with a Philippine navy guided missile frigate and offshore patrol vessel in an undisclosed part of the South China Sea.\nThe U.S. and the Philippines share a seven-decades-old Mutual Defense Treaty, which the Biden administration has called \"ironclad,\" affirming it extends to the entire South China Sea.\nWhat People Are Saying\nJay Tarriela, Philippines coast guard spokesperson, wrote on X: \"It is also important to highlight that the deployment of our white hull vessels to address China's unlawful presence demonstrates the government's intent to deescalate tensions and pursue a peaceful resolution to these violations of international law. The Philippine government's use of PCG assets in this context aims not to provoke China, but to resolve differences through rational discussion and adherence to international law.\"\nOpen-source researcher MT Anderson wrote on X: \"Coast guard vessel 5902 (AKA the Monster) continues illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive behavior deep within the Philippine EEZ. The Philippines' BRP Gabriela Silang continues to patrol and provide deterrence to the CCG vessel, only 693 meters away. It would be a short sail for U.S. Carrier Strike Group 1 to say hello...\"\nWhat's Next?\nNeither Beijing nor Manila is likely to cede ground on the South China Sea dispute anycreated_at soon.\nWhile Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has stressed he does not seek confrontation with China, his administration has stepped up its military modernization program, including last year's purchase of BrahMos cruise missiles from India.\nThe Philippines is also pursuing the U.S. Army's Mid-Range Capability, or \"Typhon,\" missile system to strengthen its maricreated_at defenses, prompting warnings from Beijing.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nPhilippines Shadows China 'Monster Ship'\nCopernicus Data Space Ecosystem\nThis photograph captured on January 19 by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellites appears to show the Philippine coast guard vessel BRP Gabriela Silang, top, monitoring the Chinese coast guard cutter 5901 in the Philippines exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea.

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences:\nA study published in theInternational Journal of Digital Earthpresents a novel application of the Sustainable Development Science Satellite-1 (SDGSAT-1) for observing offshore oil and gas platforms. Researchers from the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences leveraged the advanced capabilities of SDGSAT-1's Glimmer Imager (GLI) and Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) to monitor gas flaring activities in the South China Sea.\nOffshore oil and gas platforms are crucial for energy production but pose significant environmental risks, particularly due to emissions from gas flaring. Monitoring these platforms across large and dynamic oceanic regions has long been a challenge. This study addresses that issue by combining the visible light detection capabilities of the GLI with the thermal imaging of the TIS, offering a unique and synergistic approach to mapping platform operations.\nThe researchers developed an innovative algorithm using GLI's Pan and RGB (a color mode) bands to detect the distinctive reddish starbursts associated with gas flares. This innovation produced vivid images of gas flares, which appeared as large reddish clusters in the RGB imagery, thus improving monitoring and understanding of these flaring activities.\nAt the same created_at, the TIS sensor captured high-temperature anomalies and smoke plumes rising from the platforms. This dual-sensing capability not only confirmed the presence of gas flaring but also provided additional insights into the heat emissions from these platforms.\nUsing this approach, the study identified 113 oil and gas platforms within a complex maricreated_at landscape of islands, vessels, and other offshore facilities in the South China Sea. This is the first application of nightcreated_at visible bands specifically for monitoring gas flaring, emphasizing the potential of GLI RGB imagery for detecting industrial heat sources.\nThe research highlights SDGSAT-1's ability to track offshore oil and gas platforms, and refine platform inventories. By aligning with global sustainability goals, such as SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 14 (Life Below Water), the findings contribute to the broader initiative aimed at achieving Zero Routine Flaring by 2030.\n"

Robert Ace Barbers believes that the United States (US) would still be a dependable ally of the Philippines on the West Philippine Sea (WPS) issue during President Donald Trump's second stint at the White House.\n\"I think both countries will benefit from each other. Meaning, the interest of the US and the interest of the Philippines in the [WPS] will both be protected,\" Barbers said on Monday, Jan. 20.\nThe controversial Trump, a Republican, convincingly beat his Democrat rival, Kamala Harris, during the race for Washington in November 2024. Trump is taking over the US presidency from Joe Biden, a democrat.\nThe expected shift in numerous policies under Trump has caused concern among Filipinos, particularly on whether or not the US would follow through with its oft-repeated \"iron-clad\" commitment to protect the Philippines.\nBut Barbers says there's nothing to worry about. \"Being a treaty ally I believe that they will alway be there to support and, if it comes to a point, to defend us.\"\nThe US and Philippines are signatories to the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) of 1951.\n\"The poltical, economic, and maybe military interests ng these two allies will be primordial,\" the Mindanaoan said.\nBarbers also made a distinction between the elected president and the country or State.\n\"The interests of the Philippines and US are aligned in that part of the world regardless of who sits as president. It is their nation's interest, not their president's interest,\" the Nacionalista Party (NP) stalwart said.\nTrump first term as US president was from 2017 to 2021.\nThe Philippines has long been embroiled in a territorial dispute with China in the WPS, which is part of the broader South China Sea. China has an expansive historical claim over the entirety of the South China Sea, which in July 2016 was invalidated by a landmark ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at The Hague.\nChina has never recognized this ruling. Meanwhile, the Philippines has enjoyed support from other nations, including the US, on this issue.\nBarbers said differences aside, \"We should still exert all efforts to be friendly and diplomatic about our relationship with all our neighbors, especially China.\"\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

The Chinese Defense Ministry and the North Korean Embassy in Beijing, China, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nThe deployment came as China maintained its military presence around Taiwan, which is a self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its territory, and the contested maricreated_at features in the South China Sea. In the Korean Peninsula, North Korea continued its weapon tests. Guam is an ideal staging area to project military power, as it is only over 1,600 miles away from Taiwan and the South China Sea and 1,800 miles away from South Korea.\nWhat To Know\nAccording to a photo posted by the U.S. Air Force's 28th Bomb Wing, a bomber unit that is located at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, a pair of B-1B bombers landed at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam last Friday for the Bomber Task Force 25-1 mission.\nTwo other B-1B bombers were visible in the photo as the aircraft, also known as Lancer, parked on the flight line. Another photo provided by the 28th Bomb Wing indicated that the first pair of Lancers arrived in Guam as early as last Wednesday for the same mission.\nThe photos of B-1B bombers in Guam are taken by Technical Sergeant Robert Trujillo. A caption reads: \"The U.S. supports the vision of the Indo-Pacific as a free and open region composed of nations that adhere to the international rules-based order.\"\nThe Bomber Task Force mission is in line with the National Defense Strategy's objectives of \"strategic predictability and operational unpredictability,\" the U.S. Pacific Air Forces said previously, which the bombers operate from overseas and Continental U.S. locations.\nBomber Task Force deployments usually last a month or more, according to Air & Space Forces Magazine. The 28th Bomb Wing last deployed its B-1B bombers to Guam last summer for the Bomber Task Force 24-6, which the bombers returned home in late June.\nIn 2020, the U.S. Air Force ended the continuous bomber presence in Guam and replaced it with Bomber Task Force deployment model, which keep its bomber force permanently based on the U.S. mainland and the bombers are regularly deployed to Guam on rotation.\nThe B-1B bomber has the largest payload of conventional weapons in America's air force inventory, capable of carrying 75,000 pounds of munitions—bombs, naval mines, and missiles. It can fly at supersonic speed to Mach 1.2 with an intercontinental flight range.\nThe bomber deployment to Guam followed the arrival of America's F-35A stealth fighter jets at Kadena Air Base on Japan's Okinawa Island last Monday. Kadena is a U.S. military hub in the region, where it is the closest U.S. air base to Taiwan at a distance of 370 miles.\nGuam and Okinawa form parts of the multi-layer U.S. island chain strategy, which seeks to constrain China's military activities by using allied or friendly territories. Guam is the centerpiece of the second island chain, while Okinawa belongs to the first island chain.\nWhat People Are Saying\nThe U.S. Air Force's 28th Bomb Wing said in a photo caption: \"Bomber Task Force Missions are designed to showcase Pacific Air Forces' ability to deter, deny, and dominate any influence or aggression from adversaries or competitors alongside allies and partner forces.\"\nThe U.S. Air Force said in a fact sheet: \"It [B-1B bomber] can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision and non-precision weapons against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any created_at.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nIt remains to be seen when the B-1B bombers will conduct their first mission out of Guam. The U.S. Air Force is likely to enhance its aircraft presence in the Western Pacific Ocean in preparation for contingencies involving China and North Korea.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nU.S. B-1B Bombers Deploy to Guam\nTech.

This strategic tightrope walk underscores Singapore's role as a neutral and pragmatic actor in a region that is increasingly pivotal to global power dynamics. Historically Singapore has embraced a foreign policy of multilateralism economic openness and strategic neutrality to safeguard its sovereignty and economic prosperity. However, the intensification of great power competition poses significant challenges compelling Singapore to adapt its strategies while maintaining its delicate balance. This essay explores how Singapore manages its relationships with these three powers the problems and challenges it encounters and the broader implications for Southeast Asia.\nSingapore's geopolitical significance stems from its location at the crossroads of major maricreated_at trade routes and its role as a global financial hub. The United States with its Indo-Pacific strategy continues to prioritize Southeast Asia to counterbalance China's rising influence. Washington's military presence and alliances in the region reflect its commitment to preserving a rules-based order. On the other hand, China's Belt Road and Initiative (BRI) and its activities in the South China Sea demonstrate its ambitions to dominate the region economically and strategically. Meanwhile, though Russia is less prominent than the US or China has sought to expand its influence through arms sales energy projects and diplomatic engagement with ASEAN countries. In this context, Singapore has adopted a pragmatic approach that prioritizes economic diversification diplomatic engagement and strategic autonomy.\nSingapore's strategy exemplifies its efforts to navigate great power rivalries. The United States remain a key trading partner and a source of advanced technology particularly in sectors such as finance cybersecurity and digital innovation. At the same created_at, China is Singapore's largest trading partner with bilateral trade exceeding $150 billion in 2024. Singapore's participation in the Regional Comprehensive Partnership Economic (RCEP) highlights its commitment to regional trade while the integration of its cooperation with China with digital infrastructure and green finance demonstrates its approach to economic pragmatics to engagement. Russia though less central to Singapore's economy offers opportunities in energy and defense with collaboration bilateral trade reaching $6 billion in 2024. Diversifying its economic partnerships mitigates Singapore's overdependence power while itself positioning as a vital node in the global trade network.\nSingapore diplomatically has leveraged its reputation as a neutral reliable mediator to foster dialogue among competing powers. It actively participates in ASEAN-led platforms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the regional East Asia Summit to promote stability. In 2024 Singapore hosted a high-dialogue level involving US Chinese and Russian officials emphasizing its role as a bridge between rival powers. Additionally, Singapore's consistent advocacy of international law including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) underscores its commitment to a rules-based order. However, Singapore's diplomatic balancing act is not a challenge. The intensifying US-China rivalry, particularly over issues such as Taiwan and the South China Sea, puts pressure on Singapore to take sides potentially jeopardizing its neutral stance.\nSecurity considerations further complicate Singapore's balancing act. The US- Singapore defence partnership anchored by the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding facilitates the rotational deployment of US military assets in Singapore. This partnership underscores Singapore's reliance on US security guarantees to deter regional threats. Simultaneously Singapore has deepened its military and strategic ties with China conducting joint naval exercises and participating in China-led security forums. Russia although a significantly less secure partner offered Singapore advanced defence technologies and cybersecurity collaboration. The challenge for Singapore lies in managing these relationships without provoking suspicion backlash from any of the major powers. For instance, the US Indo-Pacific strategy's emphasis countering on China's influence may strain Singapore's efforts to maintain balanced ties with Beijing.\nDespite its strategic adeptness Singapore faces problems significant and challenges navigating great power rivalries. One major issue is the escalating tension between the US and China has far-reaching implications for regional stability. The South China Sea dispute remains a flashpoint with both powers engaging in military maneuvers and asserting competing claims. For Singapore, any conflict in the South China Sea would disrupt vital trade routes and undermine regional security. Additionally, the growing economic bifurcation between the US and China particularly in technology and supply chains forces Singapore to navigate to competing standards and regulatory regimes. In 2024 Singapore faced pressure to restrict the adoption of 5G Chinese technologies due to US concerns about security highlighting the difficulty of balancing economic and security interests.\nRussia's role in Southeast Asia presents another layer of complexity. While the influence in the region is relatively limited compared to the US and China, its deepening ties with certain ASEAN countries such as Vietnam and Myanmar pose challenges for Singapore's regional diplomacy. Moreover, Singapore's response to Russia's actions on the global stage such as its invasion of Ukraine has tested its neutral stance. In 2024, Singapore joined Western sanctions against Russia, prompting criticism from Moscow and complicating bilateral relations. This incident underscores the difficulty of maintaining neutrality in an era of heightened geopolitical polarization.\nDomestically Singapore's pressures are related to public opinion economics and resilience. As a small open economy, Singapore is vulnerable to external shocks arising from geopolitical tensions. For instance, prolonged a US-China trade war could disrupt supply chains affecting Singapore's export-driven economy. Additionally, public sencreated_atnt plays a role in shaping foreign policy decisions. While Singaporeans broadly support the government's pragmatic approach there is growing concern about the country's dependence on external powers and the potential risks of entanglement in great power conflicts.\nLooking ahead Singapore's ability to navigate to great power rivalries will hinge on its adaptability and resilience. Strengthening ASEAN's role as a neutral platform for dialogue is essential to mitigating regional tensions. Singapore's leadership in advancing regional cooperation on issues such as digital transformation climate change and maricreated_at security can enhance its credibility as a constructive player. Additionally investing in economic diversification and technological innovation will reduce Singapore's vulnerability to external pressures. At the same created_at, it must continue to uphold its principles of international neutrality, even while competing with other powers.\nIn conclusion, Singapore's careful balancing act between the United States, China, Russia, and Southeast Asia demonstrates its commitment to safeguarding its sovereignty, economic prosperity, and regional stability. By adopting a pragmatic and balanced approach Singapore has managed to maintain positive relationships with all three powers while leveraging its position as a neutral mediator and economic hub. However, challenges posed by intensifying rivalries regional security risks and domestic pressures require Singapore to remain vigilant and adaptive. As the geopolitical landscape continues to evolve Singapore's ability to navigate complexities will be crucial not only for its future but also for the stability and prosperity of Southeast Asia.\nThe opinions expressed in this article are the author's own.\nReferences\n - Chan, Heng Chee.

    "title": "Prabowo Must Prioritize ASEAN To Strengthen Indonesia's Foreign Policy – OpEd",
    "created_at": "2025-01-20",
    "text": "\nIndonesia has long been recognized as a cornerstone of ASEAN both as a founding father and as a prominent regional leader. Since the establishment of ASEAN in 1967 Indonesia's leadership has played a pivotal role in fostering cooperation among Southeast Asian nations and mediating regional disputes. The bloc has become a critical platform for peace promoting economic growth and stability in the region and as Indonesia transitions into a new administration under Prabowo Subianto foreign policy priorities be should aligned with reinforcing its role in ASEAN. This renewed focus is essential not to only Indonesia safeguard's strategic interests but also to enhance ASEAN's cohesion and influence in an increasingly polarized global order. By leveraging its historical role in addressing emerging challenges and revitalizing leadership in ASEAN, Indonesia can ensure its long-regional term and global relevance.\nIndonesia's historical contributions to ASEAN underscore its natural leadership position. As the populous country with the largest economy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia's influence extends far beyond its borders. In the early 1990s, Indonesia played a crucial role in mediating the Cambodian conflict which destabilized the region for decades. The signing of the Peace Paris Agreements in 1991 was a landmark achievement in Southeast Asian diplomacy, solidifying Indonesia's reputation as a peacebuilder. Similarly's Jakarta involvement in facilitating peace between the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) showcased the capacity to complex mediate disputes. More recently Indonesia has sought to address tensions in the South China Sea a waterway critical where overlapping territorial claims have raised concerns over regional security. Indonesia's consistent efforts to mediate these disputes highlight its potential as a stabilizing force in ASEAN.\nHowever, maintaining and enhancing leadership is not without challenges. The geopolitical landscape in 2024 presents new complexities, particularly as the rivalry between the United States and China intensifies. Both powers are seeking to expand their influence in Southeast Asia often putting ASEAN member states in difficult positions. For Indonesia navigating this while preserving ASEAN's dynamic centrality is a delicate balancing act. The South China Sea dispute remains a key flashpoint. Although Indonesia is not a claimant in the territorial disputes concerning its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), the nearby Natuna Islands have frequently faced challenges from China's expansive nine-dash line claims. This situation has pressured Indonesia to adopt a more assertive stance while also avoiding actions that could threaten ASEAN's unity.\nAnother pressing issue is the lack of cohesion of ASEAN within itself. The principle of non-interference a cornerstone of ASEAN's diplomacy has often hampered collective decision-making. For instance, the ongoing political crisis in Myanmar following the military coup in 2021 has exposed ASEAN's inability to act decisively. Despite Indonesia's efforts to push for peace through its chairmanship in 2023 progress remains limited. Member states' diverging priorities and political systems further complicate efforts to reach consensus on critical issues. For Prabowo's administration overcoming these internal divisions and strengthening ASEAN's unity will be essential to ensuring its effectiveness as a regional bloc.\nDomestic factors also pose challenges to Indonesia's ability to lead. As of 2024, Indonesia's economy faces significant pressure from global inflation and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While its GDP growth is projected to stabilize at around 5% resources for foreign policy initiatives remain limited. Additionally, priorities such as infrastructure development poverty reduction, and political reforms demand significant attention and funding. This raises concerns about whether Indonesia can dedicate sufficient resources to advancing ASEAN's agenda. Furthermore, perceptions of Indonesia's commitment to ASEAN leadership have fluctuated in recent years with some critics arguing that Jakarta has not been as proactive as it should be in addressing regional issues.\nDespite these challenges are compelling reasons for Prabowo's administration to prioritize ASEAN as its foreign policy. Economically, ASEAN is Indonesia's largest trading partner accounting for approximately 20% of its trade total in 2023. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which includes the other five ASEAN countries, presents significant opportunities for economic integration growth. Championing initiatives that promote trade facilitation, digital transformation and sustainable development within ASEAN Indonesia can enhance its economic prospects while strengthening the bloc's collective resilience.\nStrategically a stronger ASEAN Indonesia provides platform a amplify to influence its globally. As middle powers like Japan India and the European Union seek to engage deeply with ASEAN Indonesia's leadership can position bloc the as an arbiter of neutral global affairs. This is particularly relevant in the context of the Indo-Pacific where ASEAN's centrality is being challenged by alternative frameworks such as the Quad (comprising the US India Japan and Australia). Indonesia's active engagement in shaping ASEAN's vision for the Indo-Pacific will be critical maintaining to its relevance in this evolving strategic environment.\nTo maximise the challenges and the opportunities, Prabowo's foreign policy must be proactive and strategic. First, Indonesia doubled down its role as a mediator of regional conflicts. Building on its legacy Indonesia can efforts to spearhead to resolve disputes in the South China Sea promoting dialogue and confidence-building measures. At the same created_at, Jakarta must push a more unified ASEAN response to the Myanmar crisis leveraging its clout diplomacy to bring member states together. Second, Indonesia must invest in ASEAN-led initiatives that address shared challenges such as climate change digitalization recovery and economics. These initiatives should be supported by increased funding and a clear commitment to multilateralism.\nMoreover, Indonesia must strengthen its domestic to-capacity lead. This includes enhancing the resources allocated to its foreign ministry and improving coordination among government agencies involved in ASEAN affairs. Public diplomacy should also be prioritized to build domestic support for Indonesia's ASEAN leadership. Finally, Indonesia actively must engage with global partners to strengthen ASEAN's partnerships. By positioning ASEAN as a neutral and inclusive platform Indonesia can attract investments and foster collaboration on key issues such as green energy technology and infrastructure.\nIn conclusion, President Prabowo's government has a unique opportunity to reinforce Indonesia's leadership in ASEAN by addressing both internal and external challenges. By prioritizing ASEAN in its foreign policy, Indonesia can build on its historical legacy mediate conflicts and strengthen regional cooperation. While challenges are significant, they are not insurmountable. A proactive and strategic approach will enable Indonesia to lead ASEAN in navigating an increasingly complex landscape geopolitical ensuring both regional stability and Indonesia's continued influence on the global stage. The success of this endeavour will not only benefit ASEAN but also solidify Indonesia's role as a central actor in shaping Southeast Asia's future.\nThe opinions expressed in this article are the author's own.\nReferences\n - Rizal Sukma.

Throughout this period, the brave men and women of the [Philippine Coast Guard] have faced heavy waves and tirelessly turned night into day, consistently challenging these unlawful activities of the People's Republic of China (PRC) without any sign of backing down,\" said Commodore Jay Tarriela, PCG spokesperson for West Philippine Sea.\nThe monster ship, China Coast Guard (CCG)-5901, was first detected by the PCG at 54 nautical miles off the coast of Capones Island in Zambales on Jan. 4.\nAs of 9 p.m. of Jan. 19, CCG-5901 moved away from the coast of Zambales as it was monitored at an approximate distance of 95 nautical miles.\nHowever, CCG-3304, a 111-meter-by-46-meter patrol cutter by China, approached the coast of Zambales and came as close as 65 nautical miles.\nTarriela said that BRP Gabriela Silang (OPV-8301) conducted hourly radio challenges to remind the Chinese crew that their operations within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ) breach the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to which both Manila and Beijing are signatories, and \"blatantly violate\" the 2016 Arbitral Award that nullified China's dash line claim in the South China Sea.\nHe praised the bravery of the crew of BRP Gabriela Silang, highlighting that the CCG-3304 is still bigger than the PCG ship, which measures 83 meters, but her crew \"continues to diligently fulfill its patriotic mission of challenging the unlawful presence of the Chinese Coast Guard.\"\n\"This vigilance in confronting the Chinese illegal patrols is crucial for our national security, as it prevents China from normalizing such unlawful actions.

Established in September 1977, AIPA serves as a regional parliamentary text aimed at strengthening ties among Southeast Asian lawmakers.\nJohari's visit to Cambodia followed an invitation extended by Khuon Sudary, President of the Cambodian National Assembly (NA), during the 45th AIPA General Assembly held in Phnom Penh last October.\nDuring his visit on Thursday and Friday, Johari met separately with Sudary and Senate President Hun Sen. Cambodia reaffirmed its support for Malaysia in hosting the upcoming AIPA General Assembly.\nIn an interview with Khmer created_ats on Friday, Johari highlighted that his visit to Cambodia represents a crucial advancement in the relationship between the two countries.\n'Normally it is a tradition that the host country, we just write a letter for invitation. But I was thinking this created_at I want to do it differently. So, I bring the letter personally and physically invite the guests to come to AIPA. That shows how we respect them as members of ASEAN,' he said in the interview at the Malaysian Embassy where he also held talks with Malaysian Ambassador Shaharuddin Onn.\nHe also noted that establishing 'trust' is essential for demonstrating respect for the Kingdom of Cambodia and other ASEAN member states.\n'Number one is about trust; if you don't trust your counterpart, that's when the problem comes in. I humbly come and invite you; it makes a lot of difference,' he added. 'We have been there for almost 60 years; this is a zone of peace, freedom, and neutrality.

    "text": "\nTAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Vice President Han Zheng, China’s representative at Donald Trump's inauguration, is a trusted adviser to President Xi Jinping and a long-created_at survivor of Chinese politics who rose from toiling on a collective farm and in factories to becoming one of the most powerful people in the country.\nWhy was Han chosen for this sensitive mission?\nChina’s decision to send Han, rather than its ambassador to Washington as it has in the past, appears to be a carefully calibrated signal that it is willing to improve relations with the U.S. while not leaving Xi exposed to criticism should ties worsen.\nMany of the most divisive bilateral issues involve trade, with Trump threatening to impose 60% tariffs on imports from China. But relations have also frayed over technology and China’s moves to assert its territorial claims in the South China Sea and over Taiwan. Han has extensive experience with both diplomacy — particularly meeting and greeting foreign delegations — and with projecting China's key concerns in a lower-key manner than some Chinese officials.\nWhat's Han's background?\nHan was born in the commercial hub of Shanghai in 1954, five years after the communist revolution, when much of the city's well established foreign influence was being swept away. Like many young Chinese, Han was sent to the countryside during the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution to “learn from the peasants” on orders from then-leader Mao Zedong. Many of such “sent down youth” on their return to the cities found jobs in state-run industries.\nHan rose up the in Shanghai during the 1980s and 1990s, just as China's economy was catching fire, concurrently holding Communist Party and managerial positions in the chemical and rubber industries. There he caught the eye of senior leaders and was elevated to district-level government before becoming the Shanghai's mayor and then party secretary, the city's highest position, following a financial scandal involving his predecessor. Xi had briefly held the position after the scandal, giving Han direct access to him before him became China's new leader.\nWhat impact is Han's visit likely to have?\nIn 2017, Han reached the apex of Chinese political power, the party's seven-member Politburo Standing Committee. After serving one five-year term, he was given the position of vice president, a post that Xi has imbued with new weight as adviser and envoy.\nHis presence seems to emtext Xi's desire to put U.S. relations on a more stable track, particularly when it comes to trade. On Sunday, Han met with U.S. Vice President-elect J.D. Vance and business leaders, including Elon Musk, who has grown close to Trump.\nThroughout his career, Han has shown a flair for low-key diplomacy, helping to deal with unrest in Hong Kong and attending numerous international events such as the U.N. General Assembly. Though Han often goes unnoticed due to his ranking in the Communist Party hierarchy, Xi apparently believes he is the man for the job when a subtle hand is needed to establish a positive atmosphere to avoid major pitfalls during Trump's second term. Beijing appears to have put considerable thought into how receptive Trump, who is known to be an admirer of Xi's and who places great store in personal relationships, will be toward Han.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Senate on Monday resoundingly confirmed colleague Sen. Marco Rubio to be President Donald Trump’s secretary of State, making him the first member of the 47th president’s cabinet to win the chamber’s backing.\nThe swift Senate vote, 99-0, for Rubio followed shortly after the senior senator from Florida received unanimous support, 22-0, from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which he was a member for his 14 years in the Senate.\n“Anyone in America who wants to see what American foreign policy looks like and get a good rundown on it, needs to watch [Rubio’s confirmation] hearing and watch the questions that were asked [of] Sen. Rubio and his answer to those questions,” Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, said to reporters as committee members were still filing into the room to cast their vote. “He was flawless in his presentation of American foreign policy.”\nThe committee vote was held open for the better part of an hour to allow all panel members to vote.\n“No one in this text can doubt that Marco Rubio is a very intelligent man with a remarkable understanding of American foreign policy and a very deep commitment to the American dream,” said Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, in floor remarks ahead of the confirmation vote. “That dream comes from the fact that his family has a history that started with the immigration to the United States from Cuba, and then watching their former homeland fall into a communist dictatorship that still exists to this day. That helps explain his love for America and his drive to oppose oppressive autocratic regimes that threaten freedom.”\nRubio’s confirmation may be one of the few overwhelmingly bipartisan votes that Trump’s early nominations receive from the Senate. Other top national security nominees such as former Fox News anchor Pete Hegseth to be the Defense secretary and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to be the director of national intelligence have been met with deep Democratic opposition. \nPrior to his confirmation, Rubio was the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee and the second-ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations panel.\nAt his hearing last week, Rubio impressed his colleagues with his knowledge of a wide range of issues including the declining number of countries that diplomatically recognize Taiwan, the regulatory landscape of the Australia-United Kingdom-United States security partnership, International Criminal Court indictments targeting senior Israeli leaders, support for Ukraine, China’s militarization of islands in the South China Sea, and the recent Israel-Hamas ceasefire.\n“We’re used to seeing nominees who know a lot about a couple of things and somecreated_ats who know very little about virtually everything,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said to Rubio at his confirmation hearing.  \n“But I think you’ve seen a hearing with a nominee who, agree or disagree with the points he’s made, he’s not talking out of a briefing book,” continued Kaine, who for years traded off leadership with Rubio of the Foreign Relations Western Hemisphere subcommittee. “He’s not having to thumb through a binder to decide how to answer a particular question.”\nRepublican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last week said he would appoint Ashley Moody, the state’s Republican attorney general, to replace Rubio upon his resignation from the chamber.\nThe post Senate confirms Marco Rubio as secretary of State appeared first on Roll Call.\n"

    "text": "\nSenator Marco Rubio, US President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the State Department, said China should stop messing around with the Philippines and Taiwan, noting that its deeply destabilizing actions in the region are compelling the US to counteract.\nDuring his confirmation hearing before the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on Thursday (Manila created_at), Rubio discouraged Beijing from carrying out anything rash or irrational when it comes to the Philippines or Taiwan if it is serious about stabilizing US-China relations.\nThe actions they are taking now are deeply destabilizing, they are forcing us to take counteractions because we have commitments to the Philippines and we have commitments to Taiwan that we intend to keep, he said.\nIf they want to destabilize the relationship or they want to at least create some pathway for stabilization of our relationship with them, they really need to stop messing around with Taiwan and with the Philippines because it's forcing us to focus our attention in ways we prefer not to have to.\nThe US senator from Florida warned that if any miscommunication or some inadvertent conflict emerges out of China's harassment in the South China Sea, which would then force the US to defend the Philippines as its treaty ally, the impact it would have on the entire globe would be enormous.\nMost recently, Beijing drew Manila's ire after it deployed a 165-meter-long coast guard vessel, dubbed monster ship, near Zambales, an example of the harassment Rubio mentioned in the hearing.\nThe Philippines feels threatened by it, rightfully so. We've seen this on a daily basis with the harassment and so forth, he said.\nIf, God forbid, there is some miscommunication or some inadvertent conflict emerges there and we have obligations to them (the Philippines), the impact that it will have on the entire globe is enormous and that includes Europe.\nIn a text message to the Philippine News Agency, Manila-based geopolitical analyst and De La Salle University Department of International Studies professor Don McLain Gill said Rubio's remarks indicate that the stability of US-China relations rests greatly on whether China would respect Philippine sovereignty and sovereign rights.\nHis statements, Gill said, also made it clear that China is indeed the aggressor in the West Philippine Sea and that the US-Philippines alliance will remain vital in Washington's security calculations.\nBy upholding US security commitments to the Philippines and highlighting the significance of Philippine security as a determinant for future US-China ties, Senator Rubio illustrated how the bilateral alliance and US security commitments to the Philippines are not up for bargain and will not be subjected to any tradeoff between the US and China, Gill said.\nIn the same hearing, Rubio emphasized Manila's strategic importance to Washington DC not only on the military perspective but also over the real economic opportunities it could explore with the country.\nHe also acknowledged the Philippine government's \"welcoming attitude\" in recent years to further boost engagement with the US.\nMeanwhile, he told the US Senate committee that Washington DC must show results so that this alliance becomes enduring.\nWhen your engagement with a country leads to economic development - whether it's outbound US investment in the Philippines or what have you - then that becomes enduring, he said. - PNA\n"

    "title": "Can Ishiba's ASEAN Diplomacy Yield The Desired Dividend? – Analysis",
    "created_at": "2025-01-20",
    "text": "\nIn preparation to face the Opposition's demands and allegations in the ordinary session of parliament that begins on 24 January 2025, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba prepares to face trials and tribulations for the minority government that he heads. In preparation of this, Ishiba chose to indulge in a bit of foreign policy diplomacy by visiting two important countries in Southeast Asia - Indonesia and Malaysia - in the second week of January 2025 to boost his parliamentary management skills.\nIshiba also hopes to visit the United States to meet with Donald Trump who moved to the While House for a second term in the presidency. By this diplomatic move, Ishiba hoped his minority government shall get a boost. It is unclear whether Ishiba's foreign policy strategy shall yield the expected dividend as his plate is already full with domestic affairs and if he can afford to indulge more on diplomacy.\nThe highlights of Ishiba's four-day visit to Malaysia and Indonesia were aimed to deepen security and economic cooperation thereby shoring up ties with Southeast Asia as China expands its regional clout and to navigate under Trump.02 period.\nAmid growing international uncertainty, Ishiba chose to visit the two Southeast Asian countries as his first diplomatic overseas trip aside from international conferences in a multilateral setting since taking office in October 2024. He met with Malaysian leader Anwar Ibrahim and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, both of whom agreed to work more closely with Japan, not only in the more traditional economic, investment and energy arenas, but also on security matters. The fact that Ishiba prioritised Malaysia, which is this year's chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), an organisation critical to Tokyo's regional interests, and Indonesia, the region's largest country and economy, was no coincidence.\nIshiba's aim was to strengthen relations with two key Southeast Asian neighbors and trading partners. The significance of the timing of the visit can be also seen as it came amid China's increasing maricreated_at presence in the region. Both Malaysia and Indonesia are key energy suppliers for Japan and Ishiba's aim was to ensure a stable supply from them while supporting their impressive economic growth.\nWhile Malaysia will serve as the chair of ASEAN in 2025, Indonesia is a member of the Group of 20. Both countries are key players among the emerging nations of the Global South. The leaders of the three countries focused on strengthening maricreated_at security cooperation and advance economic cooperation, with an emphasis on decarbonization initiatives. Both Malaysia and Indonesia are recipients of Japan's Official Security Assistance (OSA) initiative, which includes the provision of defense equipment.\nIshiba's visit to Indonesia came days after the visit of Japan's Defense Minister Gen. Nakatani to Jakarta and discussion with his Indonesian counterpart and other defense officials on January 7th during which both leaders agreed to begin discussion on maricreated_at security cooperation. What is noteworthy is before taking office in October 2024, Prabowo served as defense minister and he understood the importance of deepening defense and security cooperation with Japan in view of lurking threats from China's expansionist designs.\nAs was expected, during the summit with Prabowo, Ishiba pledged the provision of high-speed patrol boats to the Indonesian navy as part of the OSA initiative. The two leaders also discussed the joint development of vessels based on Japan's Maricreated_at Self-Defense Force destroyers. China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea over territorial claims have stoked tensions in the region and Japan-Indonesia maricreated_at security cooperation stems from such concern.\nBoth Ishiba and Prabowo also decided to hold a so-called two-plus-two meeting of foreign and defense ministers by the end of 2025, their first since March 2021. Japan held its inaugural two-plus-two meeting with Indonesia in 2015. It marked the first such security framework with a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Both sides have realised that both are important strategic partners that share fundamental values and principles. Prabowo was candid in saying Japan is a very important partner for Indonesia and that Ishiba's visit symbolised the two countries' commitments to strengthening cooperation in various fields.\nJapan expects to counterbalance China's maricreated_at advances by deepening collaboration with Indonesia, a leading ASEAN member. Tokyo also aims to serve as a bridge between ASEAN and the United States due to concerns in Southeast Asia over the America-first policy of the Trump administration. Ishiba and Prabowo confirmed that the two countries will work together on defense equipment, technology cooperation and personnel exchanges. One option agreed was joint development of a naval vessel based on a Maricreated_at Self-Defense Force destroyer.\nOn the economic front, the leaders confirmed that the two countries will cooperate on issues related to resources and infrastructure in the context of reducing the carbon footprint in the Asian region. Indonesia, which advocates an omnidirectional foreign policy, has strong economic ties with China. It may be mentioned that on January 6, 2025, Indonesia formally joined BRICS, which comprises Brazil, China, India, Russia and other emerging economies.\nLike with Prabowo of Indonesia, Ishiba also met with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and discussed to bolster security cooperation to counter maricreated_at moves by China. The objective was to send a message that Japan is committed to raising its profile in regional affairs. Japan's focus on engagement with the ASEAN neighbours also had the footprint of Trump's expected approach to make bilateral deals with many countries rather than engaging in multilateral diplomatic initiatives to address regional and global issues.\nThere seems to be a realisation that world politics need to be rebooted in view of the expected disruptive policies by Trump during his second tenure. The year 2025 is expected to undergo many tumultuous phases amid complexity and unpredictability. There is a realization therefore to remain engaged so that a free and open international order based on the rule of law is maintained and strengthened.\nLike with Indonesia, Ishiba also pledged to continue providing assistance to Malaysia under Japan's OSA program which provides defense equipment to Tokyo's allies. Ishiba and Ibrahim also discussed economic issues and agreed to further strengthen their efforts in the Asia Zero Emission Community plan to establish a carbon-neutral Asia in the future. They also agreed to cooperate in strengthening the supply chain for essential products such as semiconductors.\nThe two leaders also agreed to cooperate in providing support to Palestine, a major concern for Malaysia which has a large Muslim population. Malaysia is not only a key nation for sea lanes in the region, but also serves as chair of ASEAN. The importance that Japan attaches to Malaysia and the ASEAN grouping is demonstrated from the fact that Ishiba is the fourth consecutive prime minister of Japan to choose a nation in that region for the first foreign visit outside of an international conference.\nMuch like Japan's territorial dispute with China over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, coastal ASEAN nations also have their own disputes with China in the South China Sea. Japan has provided assistance through its OSA program to such nations. The members of the ASEAN bloc look forward to Japan for support more than the US as the bloc does not see much hope from Trump with his America-first doctrine. Even during his first term, Trump attended only one of the annual summit meetings with ASEAN leader during his first term and so do not see much hope of support from Trump during his second term. This scenario makes a compelling reason for deepening Japan-ASEAN engagement so that the elephant in the room - China - kept in check.\n"

    "text": "\nDICTATORS do not speak the language of appeasement. The West must not repeat mistakes of the past.\nWhen Donald Trump takes office, his greatest challenge will be how he deals with the new axis of totalitarian states. This axis comprises China, North Korea, Russia, Iran, Myanmar and a growing number of others. With China at its heart, it poses the greatest threat the Free World has faced since the Cold War.\nChina is a dictatorship, committing genocide in Xinjiang to eradicate the Uyghurs, it uses forced labour, persecutes religious groups and democracy campaigners. China is now building up its military and navy at an astonishing rate, to challenge the US. It has asserted ownership of disputed strategic territories in the South China Sea. Perhaps most critical is its threat to invade Taiwan.\nThe interesting thing about brutal dictators is that they tell you in advance what their ambitions are. Leaders in the West failed to believe Hitler and tens of millions died.\nVladimir Putin couldn't be clearer about his plans for greater Russia. Xi Jinping has made no secret of his plans to turn China into the dominant global superpower militarily and economically. He believes democracy and human rights are an aberration and that his form of autocracy is the historical norm.\nChina is still a very close partner of Russia. Both observed the chaotic withdrawal of western troops from Afghanistan and will have reached the same conclusion that the West lacks the leadership and perseverance to stay the course. It was that debacle that emboldened Putin to invade Ukraine.\nThe harsh reality is that most\nEuropean countries ignored the signals and had hollowed out their defence capability, spending instead on what they saw as domestic priorities. Whilst the UK led the way early in supporting Ukraine, too many Western European countries were slow to act, dependent for their energy on Russia.\nIn December 2023, I went to Washington with a small group of Conservative MPs to discuss the proposed funding for Ukraine, which at that created_at hung in the balance in Congress. This was not long after the October 7 massacre. The attack on Israel helped both Russia and China, by taking America's attention off Ukraine and Taiwan.\nThis axis will have suspected that Israel's needs would outweigh Kyiv's in the US, giving Russia created_at and isolating Ukraine at a critical moment.\nTrump's plans to achieve some kind of peace accord between Putin and President Zelensky are on the face of it laudable. However, as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher knew, the lesson of the Second World War was that peace without justice never lasts. Remember how Hitler was given the Sudetenland by France and Britain in an attempt to appease him - a year later Hitler invaded the rest of the country.\nI have been to Ukraine on a number of occasions and seen first-hand the astonishing bravery of the Ukrainian people. Their fight should be seen as our fight in the West. Ukraine deserves more than a short-term settlement, in which Putin is rewarded for brutality.\nI hope Trump recognises Ukraine's predicament has come about because of weak leadership in the West and its appeasement of Russia and China. If Ukraine is forced to accept Russia's hold over 20 per cent of their country, then in echoes of 1938, Putin will be back for the rest.\nWith China looking on, our weakness will mean Taiwan is next.\nI pray we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.\n'Ukraine deserves more than a short-term settlement that rewards Putin for his brutality' 'The interesting thing about dictators is that they tell you what their ambitions are'\n"

    "text": "\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio appeared in a Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday for U.S. secretary of state, where he said that American voters expressed a clear preference on U.S. foreign policy when they chose Donald Trump to return to the White House.\n\"They want a strong America that is engaged in the world but guided by a clear objective to promote peace abroad, and security and prosperity at home,\" he stated.\nThe 53-year-old Republican spoke about how under his leadership, the United States would confront a wide range of foreign policy challenges at a created_at when Republicans are focused on curtailing U.S. government spending.\nRubio said every dollar the U.S. spends and every policy it pursues will be assessed on whether it makes America safer, stronger and/or more prosperous.\n\"Prudence in the conduct of foreign policy is not an abandonment of our values. It is the common sense understanding that while we remain the wealthiest and the most powerful nation on the Earth, our wealth has never been unlimited, and placing our core national interest above all else is not isolationism,\" Rubio affirmed.\nPath forward for Gaza\nThe hearing included brief interruptions by hecklers, which Rubio brushed off. Almost two hours into his testimony, news broke that Israel and Hamas had accepted a truce proposal, brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt.\nRubio, who supports the deal, expressed full support for Israel's right to defend itself and acknowledged the humanitarian toll of the war launched after the Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023.\nHe also pointed out that there are opportunities available now in the Middle East that did not exist 90 days ago.\n\"Whether it's what's happened in Lebanon, whether it's what's happened in Syria, whether it's what hopefully will happen with this ceasefire and the release of hostages after horrifying detention and unjustifiable actions by Hamas, whether it's any of these things, are all in combination, there are now factors at play in the Middle East that I think we can build upon and may open the door to extraordinary and historic opportunities,\" he said.\nUkraine-Russia war\nDemocratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen was among the legislators who questioned Rubio about his planned approach to the Ukraine-Russia war.\n\"What you think is important for us to do in order to ensure that there is the strongest possible negotiating position if Ukraine and Russia do get to the negotiating table?\" Shaheen asked.\nRubio said, \"I think it should be the official position of the United States that this war should be brought to an end.\"\nBut he cautioned it will require bold diplomacy. \"My hope is that it could begin with some ceasefire. It is important for everyone to be realistic. There will have to be concessions made by the Russian Federation, but also by the Ukrainians, and the United States lends itself there.\"\nChina's ambitions\nRepublican Senator Pete Ricketts asked Rubio how he sees the threat from Beijing.\n\"Since the election in November. So, this is over the last two months, the PRC has hacked our Treasury Department, including CFIUS, what has been described as the worst telecom hack in U.S. history, sabotaged important undersea communication cables in Asia and Europe, deployed ships to the South China Sea to harass our allies,\" Rickett said. \"It's created_at for us to go on the offensive and abandon illusions about what kind of adversary we're faced [with].\"\nRubio agreed and described the Communist Party of China as \"the most potent and dangerous near peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.\" He further noted, \"They have elements that the Soviet Union never possessed. They are a technological adversary and competitor, an industrial competitor, an economic competitor, a geopolitical competitor, a scientific competitor.\"\nMuch of what the United States needs to do to confront China is not abroad but at home, Rubio said.\n\"We have to rebuild our domestic industrial capacity, and we have to make sure that the United States is not reliant on any single other nation, for any of our critical supply chains,\" he said.\nUS-Mexico cooperation\nRepublican Senator Steve Daines asked Rubio what he envisions for the U.S. relationship with Mexico.\n\"Look, Mexico's economy, in many ways, is a very vibrant one, and has made tremendous advances and continues to be a very strong regional power,\" Rubio replied.\nHe also pointed out three areas of friction: \"The first is on trade and violations of trade agreements.\" The second is the security situation at the border, he continued: \"I think there's great interest and should be on the part of the Mexicans to bring this migratory problem at the border under control.\"\nThe violence and flow of illegal drugs such as Fentanyl trafficked by criminal transnational groups, also needs to be addressed, Rubio warned.\n\"It is in their interest, as well as ours, that we work cooperatively to take these groups apart and not allow them to continue the reign of terror, not just in the border region of Mexico, but spilling over into the United States,\" he said.\nRubio is the son of Cuban immigrants and has served in the U.S. Senate since 2011. With mostly nods from Republican and Democratic legislators during Tuesday's confirmation hearing, Rubio could become the first secretary of state of Latino origin, as soon as Jan. 20. - VOA\n"

    "text": "\nLANGKAWI  Asean needs to double down on regional integration to enhance the grouping's competitiveness, especially at a created_at when changes to geopolitical structures and economic policy are taking place worldwide, said Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.\n \"(Asean) cannot control the agendas of the superpowers, or indeed the larger powers, but we can, and we should focus on integrating ourselves, strengthening our economies, and our connectivity,\" he told Singapore media in a wrap-up interview following the Asean foreign ministers' retreat in Langkawi, Malaysia, on Jan 19. \n Acknowledging the global shift towards more protectionist and nationalistic policies, including the threat of tariffs and trade-restrictive measures by incoming US president Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated on Jan 20, Dr Balakrishnan said Asean will have to adapt accordingly.\n \"We look forward to his inauguration and to the policies, and we will have to make the necessary adjustments even as he makes changes to his policies,\" he said.\n But to bolster against external pressures, Asean will have to \"double down\" on regional integration as well as connectivity, and make itself as competitive as possible as a trading partner, an investment destination, or even as an investment source, he said. \n \"(These can be achieved) by having long-term policies which are consistent, which are reliable, which are trustworthy, and to keep open engagements in an inclusive way with all the major powers,\" said Dr Balakrishnan. \n The closed-door gathering among foreign ministers and representatives from the political and economic grouping's 10-member states took place in Langkawi, and is the first high-level Asean meeting to be hosted by Malaysia, the 2025 chair.\n Already, Asean has strengthened its economies and connectivity through several existing trade agreements, both within the region and with its dialogue partners. \n During his interview with Singapore media, Dr Balakrishnan said the ministerial meeting discussed upgrading the existing Asean Trade in Goods Agreement as well as its free trade agreements with China, South Korea and India. \n Multilateral agreements, including the Asean Digital Economy Framework Agreement, are also on the table to foster greater links within the members, said Dr Balakrishnan. \n The agreement, launched in September 2023, serves as a road map for Asean's transformation into a digital economy and society, and will facilitate trade, data flows and online payments within the region. \n Negotiations for the agreement are expected to conclude in 2025. \n Dr Balakrishnan also highlighted the proposed Asean Power Grid as a \"concrete\" project that will promote regional trade, investments and connectivity. The initiative will enhance cross-border energy trade and promote the region's green energy transition. \n The gathering in Langkawi took place against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions, including conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, and the broader US-China rivalry. \n The increasing tensions in the disputed South China Sea as well as the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Myanmar were also raised during the Asean ministerial discussion. \n Myanmar, which has been engulfed in civil war since the coup of February 2021, was represented at the retreat by Mr Aung Kyaw Moe, permanent secretary of the junta-controlled Foreign Ministry. \n Myanmar's ruling generals remain barred from formal Asean meetings over their failure to comply with an Asean peace plan. Among other things, the plan, also known as the Five-Point Consensus, calls for an immediate end of violence, dialogue among all stakeholders, and to allow an Asean special envoy to visit Myanmar to meet all parties. \n At a press conference at the end of the retreat on Jan 19, Malaysian Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan said that former Malaysia diplomat Othman Hashim has been appointed Asean's special envoy on the crisis in Myanmar.\n The special envoy assumes a one-year rotating term, with a new appointment made each created_at the Asean chairmanship changes hands.\n During the meeting, Asean leaders continued to reaffirm the Five-Point Consensus and called on all parties in Myanmar to cease hostilities immediately. \n However, the situation in Myanmar is nowhere near resolution, Dr Balakrishnan told Singapore media. \n \"Myanmar remains an integral member of Asean, but it needs to sort itself out. It needs national reconciliation, (and) to the extent that Asean can act as a convener for all the different stakeholders in Myanmar to come together, we will seek national reconciliation in a longstanding, fair and forward-looking way.\" \n On Asean's convening power, Dr Balakrishnan said leaders discussed the grouping's ability to bring together key economic partners through its platforms such as the East Asia Summit. \n With Asean at its core, the East Asia Summit brings together eight major partners -- Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the US -- for dialogue. \n \"Virtually everyone who has a stake and is relevant to Asean is represented, and we look forward to this meeting that will be chaired by Malaysia as chairman of Asean, to be able to generate some form of consensus and alignment among Asean and all our major economic partners,\" he said. \n Meanwhile, there has been a growing interest in other international groupings, including Brics, an alliance that includes Brazil, Russia, India and China. \n In recent months, Asean members Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand became Brics' partner countries, while Indonesia was the first South-east Asian country to be given full membership. \n Pointing to other groupings, including Aukus and the Quad, Dr Balakrishnan said there has been a proliferation of new or expanding networks. \n \"Basically, this is a period of uncertainty, and countries are trying to expand their networks, build new opportunities economically, make more friends and hedge, or keep their options open.\" \n He said that Singapore, which fundamentally has good relationships with all, assesses and monitors the strategic and economic coherence of such groupings. \n \"My bottom line is, we keep our options open. We are not against the emergence of these groupings and, where possible, if we can work together with them, we will happily do so. \n \"As for membership, we will have to look far more carefully before we sign on to anything,\" he said. \n While in Langkawi, Dr Balakrishnan also met Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son. They spoke about expanding the scope of cooperation in emerging sectors such as renewable energy, carbon credits and the digital economy. \n The countries will upgrade the bilateral ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2025, said Dr Balakrishnan in a social media post on Jan 19.\n Dr Balakrishnan also met his Malaysian counterpart, Mr Mohamad, and they discussed follow-up priorities from the 11th Malaysia-Singapore Leaders' Retreat held on Jan 7. \n The Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone agreement was finalised at the earlier bilateral retreat in Putrajaya, during which the prime ministers of both nations also touched on collaboration in areas such as education and energy, and discussed complex issues regarding airspace, water and the delimitation of maricreated_at boundaries.\n"

    "text": "\n If the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) ever believed that their 5-point plan in response to the 2021 Myanmar military coup would ever be implemented by the ruling junta, it was surely a case of wishful thinking.\nThe bland assumption that the coup regime was prepared to make concessions to the ASEAN plan - a signed pledge by the junta that committed all parties to ending violence, engaging in dialogue to find a peaceful solution and facilitating humanitarian assistance - reflects a very naïve understanding of how Myanmar's military caste has dominated the nation's politics and society for nearly 60 years, since its first coup back in 1962.\nThe UN and western countries have always deferred to 'ASEAN centrality' in dealing with violent conflicts in their region. However, while the Myanmar crisis has escalated in every sector - aerial bombardment of civilians, military atrocities including the hacking off of heads and burning people alive, a tottering economy, food scarcity, malnutrition and waves of refugees - far from leading western countries towards a conflict resolution, ASEAN diplomacy has stalled around their 5-point proposal.\nLONG TROUBLED HISTORY\nIf we look back at recent history of ASEAN's record in coping with regional crises in peace-making, and conflict resolution, then it should come as no surprise that they are floundering to come up with any new initiative to solve their Myanmar conundrum.\nDuring the last 40 years when the region's leadership has been deeply challenged by - The Cambodia conflict (1979- 1991), Indonesia's bloody suppression of East Timor's struggle for self- determination (1980s-1999), South China Sea conflict with China, and the Thai-Cambodia border hostilities over Preah Vihear temple - have all been issues that cried out for an ASEAN initiative to set in motion peace-making or conflict resolution.\nIn the case of Cambodia, Dr Paul Chambers, a specialist in regional governance and military affairs, says 'ASEAN's involvement in Cambodia, often had destructive results. Thailand worked with China, and the CIA together with ousted Khmer Rouge forces during the 1980s to overthrow the new government based in Phnom Penh.' \nWhile some ASEAN member states participated in UN peacekeeping in Cambodia's UN Peacekeeping Operation (UNTAC), it was always under the UN flag, in common with a UN operation in East Timor in 2000 (UNTAET).\nThe addition of new members added to ASEAN - now 10 member states - has made it harder than ever for this bloc to forge any unity on controversial issues - handicapped by a consensus rule that all states must be in agreement and a clear reluctance to 'interfere' in their members' internal affairs.\nFor example, the strong complaints of three ASEAN members Vietnam, Philippines and Indonesia over China's aggressive tactics in the South China Sea, and Beijing's refusal to recognize their competing territorial claims over some of the archipelago's myriad islands, failed to get any support from support from Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia, all heavily indebted to Beijing's aid and investment.\nASEAN's main achievements have always been focused on increasing regional cooperation in trade, infrastructure, and economic development where it was relatively easy for the 10 member states to reach a consensus.\nFAILURE WITH CONFLICTS\nDr Chambers, author and co-editor of 'Khaki Capital: The Political Economy of the Military in Southeast Asia' told Mizzima, 'ASEAN has never shown itself to be successful in resolving previous conflicts.'\nSince the Myanmar military junta signed but then snubbed ASEAN's resolution shortly after their coup, Myanmar has plummeted into war, economic crisis, and prompted a massive flood of refugees, food scarcity, and collapse of the health and education services. This certainly raises serious doubts about why the EU, and other western countries should be waiting for ASEAN to come up with any solutions.\nThe reality on the ground inside Myanmar dooms ASEAN's formula for peace based on deeper engagement and dialogue with all parties including the State Administration Council (SAC) or military junta as just the empty rhetoric of a talking shop.\nASEAN's only sanction on the SAC is confined to the exclusion of Myanmar junta chief Min Aung Hlaing from summit meetings. However, under the radar, SAC officials attend regional meetings on everything from connectivity, climate change, drugs and crime, free trade and foreign affairs.\nThe opposition National Unity Government (NUG) that includes representatives of the former elected National League for Democracy (NLD) government, has reminded ASEAN that the UN General Assembly has firmly rejected the SAC-Junta credentials and strongly condemned the coup. \nThis means that in International Law the SAC is an illegal regime still craving for recognition according to UN human rights rapporteur for Myanmar, Tom Andrews. He argues that since 2021, it has lost its status as even a 'De Facto' regime, owing to the armed resistance armies battlefield victories, which puts them in control of over 50 per cent of the territory. \nA new think-tank based in Bangkok founded by former Thai journalist Mr. Supalak Ganjanakhundee concludes that: 'For ASEAN, the situation in Myanmar has yet again, put the concepts of 'ASEAN Centrality' and 'non-interference' in internal affairs, to a test and challenged their viability in a fast-changing world.'\nCritics are questioning the ability of ASEAN member states to effectively resolve their political emergencies, according to the report: Thailand  and  Myanmar at The Crossroads: Strategic Pathways to Regional Peace and Stability CSP Bangkok published by Mizzima Weekly.\nLESSONS FROM CAMBODIA?\nCan ASEAN learn lessons from Cambodia's defeat of an intransigent pariah regime and its pathway to peace?\nIn the period of almost four years since the 2021 Myanmar coup, ASEAN's softly, softly diplomacy in dealing with the Myanmar junta, stands in stark contrast to the ever-worsening situation and the war raging inside the country.\n\"We have collected substantial evidence showing horrific levels of brutality and inhumanity across Myanmar,\" said Nicholas Koumjian, chief of the UN's Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM). Their report, which covers July 1, 2023-June 30, 2024, said the conflict had \"escalated substantially\" and \"at an alarming rate.\" These UN fact- finding reports are shared with the International Criminal Court (ICC). \nSenior General Min Aung Hlaing is the first Myanmar coup leader to be accused by the ICC of crimes against humanity linked to a 'genocidal persecution' of the minority Rohingya back in 2017 in an ongoing UN case that preceded the 2021 coup.\nCalls have been made by UN human rights bodies that the ICC should now expand its Myanmar mandate and jurisdiction to cover the junta leader to be held accountable for multiple war-crimes since the 2021 coup. Tom Andrews, UN rapporteur on Myanmar declared that, 'Systematic, gross human rights violations, amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity, are being perpetrated daily on the people of Myanmar,' in a report to UN Human Rights Council. \nIf this assessment is correct, then surely the military junta now ranks as the worst regime in the region since the Khmer Rouge brought in Year- Zero and terrorized the Cambodian people between 1975-79? Dr Chambers responds: 'Yes, I think that is an accurate assessment.'\nASEAN OBLIVIOUS\nOn the other hand, ASEAN remains oblivious to human rights and war crimes issues that have cast the coup regime as a pariah state at the UN headquarters in New York.\nASEAN's core interests have always centred on connectivity, infrastructure and trade. Human rights apparently has such a low priority among that nine member-states that they have never joined the 124 ICC member states.\nCambodia alone is the only member of the ICC and the only Asian country that has so far hosted a UN-backed Tribunal based on international law to investigate and judge the senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge 'Killing Fields' regime, a tribunal that officiated in the 2006-2024 period. \nWhile there are many differences in comparing the two phenomena - Myanmar's disastrous military rule and the genocidal rule of the Khmer Rouge that lasted only four years - there are some intriguing parallels. \nWhat can we learn from Cambodia's long path to peace and how they ended the Khmer Rouge nightmare?\nThe sheer scale of atrocities committed by the Myanmar military directly targeting the civilian gatherings, systematic arson of villages, of schools, health clinics and religious buildings adds up to a prima facie legal case of the worse war crimes in South East Asia, since the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime (1975-79). \nThe Myanmar Armed Forces or Tatmadaw that staged the first coup in 1962 led by General Ne Win, ousted a fledgling democracy. The ideology and mind-set of the military still clinging onto power, remains remarkably unchanged almost 60 years later. \nIn the early 1960s Burma and Cambodia (along with the Philippines) were regarded as the three most advanced countries in the region, when Singapore and Malaysia were still British colonies and Thailand lagged behind their neighbours.\nHowever, the twin disasters of military rule in Myanmar from 1962, and US bombing and the rise of the genocidal regime in Cambodia in the early 1970s wrecked their development potential, and sent waves of refugees abroad to form major diaspora populations in Australia, France, US and the UK. \nAfter independence Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, soon overtook Myanmar, Cambodia and the Philippines (that lagged under the baggage of martial law declared by President Ferdinand Marcos in 1971.)\nThe peoples of Myanmar suffered military dictatorship from 1962 to 2011 - with an interlude that could be termed a sort of 'Myanmar Spring' which spawned an NLD-led government from 2015-2020. Now the 2021 coup has added four more years to the previous 49 years of economic misery and absolutist military rule.\nCould ASEAN learn something from some parallels between the historical role of military regimes in Myanmar, the 1962 Ne Win coup and how the Khmer Rouge Killing Fields plunged Cambodia back into the dark ages until their last surviving leaders surrendered in 1999?\nThe Khmer Rouge regime was overthrown by both an anti-Pol Pot dissident army and Vietnamese regular troops leading to a swift victory and capture of Phnom Penh on 7 January 1979.\nA UN Peacekeeping Mission organised Cambodia's first ever fully democratic election which the Khmer Rouge attempted but failed to disrupt. \nThe appeal for demoralised Khmer Rouge soldiers to surrender worked well in Cambodia, and has been effective to some extent in Myanmar, where whole battalions have waved the white flag in Karen, Rakhine and northern Shan states.\n      .\nSince the coup, more than 12,341 junta personnel -more than 3,872 soldiers and 9,326 police - have defected to the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM), according to an MOD-NUG report as of 4 January 2024. \nThe attempt by the UN and the Paris Peace Treaty to impose dialogue and reconciliation with the Khmer Rouge faction failed. After the UNTAC departed, the new government branded them as outlaws.\nThe NUG and ethnic armed groups have also mapped out a plan to exclude senior officers of the junta from any role in a future democratic government and that Myanmar's military must be completely \nrestructured.\nIn Phnom Penh, the government always reserved the right to arrest senior leaders for genocidal crimes and in cooperation with the UN put them on trial. Cambodia's Khmer Rouge War Crimes Tribunal \nbegan in 2006.  \nThe NUG-Resistance movement has adopted a similar policy that all Myanmar's senior intelligence, military and police officers will one day face justice in a tribunal under the auspices of the UN International Law and the Genocide Convention.\nNOTE: This correspondent wishes to clarify that while the Cambodia Tribunal made significant \ncontributions to the advance of international justice with the genre of a 'mixed tribunal' - a panel of both international and local judges, prosecutors, and defence lawyers; sadly these standards have not been adopted in Cambodia's domestic courts that are now more than ever controlled by an authoritarian state. \nASEAN REFORM NEEDED?\nASEAN will need major reforms to develop an effective peacekeeping and conflict infrastructure to rebolster its standing in the world in the wake of the Cambodian and Myanmar crises. \nWhereas ASEAN prides itself on being one of the developing world's most successful regional blocs, it can be argued that it lags behind Africa and the regional bloc of the African Union (AU) in the field of peacekeeping and conflict resolution.\nThe AU has led peace operations in 17 African countries, with more than 70,000 authorized personnel. Among the AU's achievements it has assisted in resolving post-election violence in the Ivory Coast, and Kenya and pressured the coup-makers to hand back power to civilian governments. The main arm of peace-keeping is led by the regional Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\nAn example of the AU's 'zero tolerance' policy for military coups is the fact that Gabon remains suspended from the African Union after the 2023 military coup. But Sudan has proved to be the most intractable of all the many coups that has defied all attempts at mediation over many years, and instability still wracks several Saharan countries, not least Niger and Mali.\nAlthough the African continent is still plagued with coups, the spirit of democracy and good governance enshrined by the AU covering a huge continent of 55 nation states is in itself an impressive achievement.\nAFRICA-ASEAN COMPARISONS\nBy contrast the complete lack of any red lines to define unacceptable rogue behaviour on the part of any ASEAN member - most obviously Myanmar - demonstrates ASEAN's shameful abdication to apply any basic common principle of good governance. \nThe historical lessons from past regional conflicts suggest that deepening ties with a regime so hated by its own citizens will solve nothing and will not facilitate the end of the war, that inevitably spills over Myanmar's porous borders with Bangladesh, China, India and Thailand.\nThe Myanmar crisis has a massive impact on its neighbours from the spill-over proliferation of cyber-crime, drug trafficking, health challenges and a refugee exodus - plus the negative effects on the ASEAN forum and the hampering of further regional development.\nASEAN is losing status on the world stage as the Myanmar crisis continues. But biting the bullet in making necessary changes to the forum's peacekeeping infrastructure will be a tough call. \nAs Nyein Kaung, an NUG-aligned academic, has pointed out, there is 'reputational damage done to ASEAN, if it chooses to stand by as a spectator, while Myanmar burns, it shows itself to be weak, and incapable of protecting its own [interests].'   \nTom Fawthrop is a veteran British journalist who has covered Southeast Asia since the 1970s. He has reported inside Myanmar for The Economist in 2002 and again in 2012-2013. and produced several documentaries for DVB TV including 'The Last Undammed River - The Campaign to stop all hydropower dams along the Salween River'. He is co-author of the book 'Getting away with Genocide? Elusive Justice  and  the Khmer Rouge Tribunal' that covered the long struggle to set up the Cambodian tribunal and bring senior Khmer Rouge to justice for the crimes against humanity  and  genocide during their rule. \n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-20",
    "text": "\nWe live in an increasingly dangerous and threatening world. There are more flashpoints in today’s global geopolitics than we have seen in decades, presenting a generational challenge to the incoming administration of Donald Trump and all of America’s elected leadership.\nAt the Panetta Institute for Public Policy, I tell students that in our democracy, we govern either by leadership or by crisis. If leadership is there and willing to take the risks associated with responsibility, we can avoid, or certainly contain, crisis. But if leadership is absent, we will inevitably govern by crisis. The same is true when it comes to foreign policy.\nAs President-elect Trump is about to be inaugurated for his second term, a fundamental question being asked around the world is whether he will repeat the unpredictable and chaotic approach to foreign policy that defined his first term or embrace the idea that he stressed repeatedly during his campaign of “peace through strength.”\nPresident-elect Trump cannot adopt that foreign policy concept, which holds that a strong military can prevent conflict, without also embracing the definition that President Ronald Reagan so eloquently gave it in his speech marking the 40th anniversary of the Normandy invasion. “We in America have learned bitter lessons from two world wars,” said Mr. Reagan, who made the idea famous. “It is better to be here ready to protect the peace than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost.” He also made clear that “the strength of America’s allies is vital to the United States.”\nThe world that awaits Mr. Trump is far different from and more threatening than what he had to confront in his first four years. Autocrats that once operated in their own spheres of influence have now joined together in an axis of mutual support and aggression: Vladimir Putin of Russia is not just a temperamental bully but also a tyrant who invaded the sovereign democracy of Ukraine and continues to threaten democracies in the West; Xi Jinping of China has made clear that he is prepared for a potential Taiwan invasion and wants to compete with the United States as a leading military power; Kim Jong-un of North Korea is not just threatening democracy in South Korea but has also sent drones and thousands of troops to Russia to fight Ukrainians; Iran, weakened by Israel, continues to enrich uranium and is ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon; and ISIS has once again raised its ugly head by inspiring a lone-wolf attack in New Orleans.\nMr. Trump has always prided himself on being a dealmaker, pledging in his campaign that he would resolve such conflicts in the first few days of his presidency. But precisely because it is a more dangerous world, that’s unlikely to happen. And if he tries and fails, the United States will appear weak. There is concern that Mr. Trump may have already started off badly by threatening Greenland, the Panama Canal Zone and Canada. Those are the kind of careless and disruptive comments that only undermine American credibility when it comes to dealing with real-world crises.\nThis is, however, a created_at when “peace through strength” could actually work. It will require strong, serious and stable leadership to turn the current multipolar crisis into an opportunity for America. The incoming president can be a dealmaker, but it must be from a position of strength. And strength begins with the United States remaining the strongest military power on the face of the earth.\nTo ensure that, the new administration must be willing to increase military investments in recruitment, training, readiness, nuclear weapons systems, the U.S. defense industrial base and research and technology. To accomplish all of this, the defense budget cannot rely on the unpredictability of continuing resolutions. There must be a five-year budget that makes clear our defense priorities and achieves savings in duplication, procurement and bureaucracy.\nOn Ukraine, it is becoming clear that Ukraine and Mr. Putin must find a way to a negotiated settlement to the war. Mr. Trump must make clear that the United States will continue to work with NATO to support Ukraine and that Mr. Putin will not be allowed to succeed. If that message is clear to Mr. Putin and if Ukraine can gain traction against Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky will have the leverage to negotiate a settlement that provides for Ukraine’s sovereignty and security, allows Russia to remain in Crimea and other limited areas and achieves an end to the war. That would be peace through strength.\nMr. Trump should tell China that it will help Taiwan defend itself, that the South China Sea will remain open pursuant to international law and that the United States will support a strong alliance of Japan, South Korea, Australia, India and other Asian countries to protect the freedom of the seas and commerce in the Pacific. From a position of greater military strength, the United States would have leverage for a more productive dialogue with China on trade, cybersecurity, fentanyl, satellites and other economic issues. To simply expand tariffs on China and start a trade war will result in an economic backlash among unhappy consumers in the United States. Retribution is not dealmaking.\nIran is yet another opportunity. Tehran has been weakened by Israel both militarily and economically; it could very well be open to negotiations on limiting nuclear enrichment and stopping support for proxies in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Since the previous Trump administration was critical to the establishment of the Abraham Accords, Mr. Trump could work with Israel to bring Saudi Arabia into the deal, along with other moderate Arab nations. Building a Middle East alliance would be important to dealing with Iran and terrorism, and establishing an approach to peace in the Middle East.\nThe president, as commander in chief, has the power and responsibility to determine America’s future security. If he is careless with that awesome power, the United States could very well find itself in another world war. But if the president understands his power, as Mr. Reagan did, he can provide strong leadership and build alliances that steer the world out of war. The key to peace is strength, and the key to strength is leadership.\nLeon E. Panetta served as secretary of defense and director of the C.I.A. in the Obama administration.

    "title": "Indonesia's Balancing Act: Navigating Superpower Rivalries And Regional Leadership In 2025 – Analysis",
    "created_at": "2025-01-20",
    "text": "\nIn 2025, Indonesia stands at a crossroads in its foreign policy navigating the complexities of its relationships with the United States China and Russia. As the economy largest in Southeast Asia and a key player in the Indo-Indo-Pacific, Indonesia's geostrategic location amplifies its importance in a world marked by intensifying competition among global powers.\nGuided by the long-standing principle of “Bebas dan Aktif” (Independent and Active) Indonesia's foreign policy seeks to maintain non-alignment while actively engaging in international diplomacy. However, the approach is tested increasingly by economic dependencies regional security challenges geopolitical rivalries. This essay argues that although Indonesia faces significant challenges in managing its foreign policy, its ability to leverage strategic autonomy and promote regional leadership will be pivotal in shaping its trajectory within a rapidly evolving global order.\nIndonesian non-aligned foreign policy has deep roots in its historical context. During the Cold War Indonesia adeptly avoided aligning either the Western or Eastern blocs choosing instead to champion the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). This strategy enabled the nation to safeguard its sovereignty while fostering international cooperation. In 2025 the “Bebas Aktif” doctrine continues to underpin Indonesia's diplomacy as it navigates a multipolar world. The country's objectives include promoting growth economic through international trade and investment ensuring regional stability and maintaining sovereignty amid rising great-power competition.\nOne of Indonesia's most significant challenges in foreign policy stems from its economic dependencies. Over the past decade, China has emerged as Indonesia's partner trading driven by robust trade and substantial investments under Beijing's Belt Road and Initiative (BRI). Key Infrastructure projects such as the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail highlight the transformative impact of Chinese investment. However, investments come with risks. Indonesia's trade balance with China remains uneven characterized by reliance on commodity exports like coal and palm oil. This reliance leaves Indonesia vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity and prices it exposes to potential debt dependency. For instance from data 2024 revealed that Chinese investments accounted for nearly 20% of Indonesia's foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows raising concerns about over-reliance on a single economic partner.\nSimultaneously's Indonesia economic ties with the United States present both opportunities and challenges. The U. S. remains a critical market for Indonesian exports, particularly textiles and palm oil and a source of FDI in the technology and manufacturing sectors. In 2024 United States investments in Indonesia's digital economy grew by 15% mutually reflecting interests in innovation. However, Washington's emphasis on human rights and environmental standards occasionally clashes with Indonesia's domestic creating policies friction in bilateral relations. For example, Indonesia's deforestation has practices criticism drawn from U. S. policymakers complicating trade negotiations and FDI prospects.\nRussia though a smaller partner economically holds strategic importance particularly in Indonesia in defence and energy cooperation. Russia's exports of advanced military equipment—such as Sukhoi fighter jets—diversified Indonesia's defence procurement and reduced reliance on Western suppliers. Additionally, partnerships in coal and natural gas projects provide Indonesia alternative with energy sources. Yet, Indonesia's engagement with Russia is not without risks. The ongoing geopolitical tensions between Russia and Western powers exacerbated by the Ukraine conflict could strain Indonesia's broader international relationships. Aligning too closely with r Moscow risk alienates Western allies including the U.S. and European Union which remain important economic strategic partners.\nGeopolitical pressures add another layer of complexity to Indonesia's foreign policy. The South Sea China dispute is persistent a China challenge with expansive claims encroaching on Indonesia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) near the Natuna Islands. In 2024 incidents involving Chinese fishing and vessels coast guard patrols in Indonesia's EEZ underscored the tensions growing. While Indonesia has taken a firm stance on its protecting sovereignty also recognizes the need to maintain strong economic ties with China requiring a delicate balance. Concurrently, the U.S. push for a “free and open Indo-Pacific” aligns with Indonesia's maricreated_at security interests. However, alignment with the U. S. risks escalating tensions with China Indonesia's largest economic partner.\nRussia's growing presence in the Indo-Pacific further complicates Indonesia's calculations. Moscow's military exercises and projects of energy in the region underscore its intent to expand influence creating additional challenges for Indonesia as it seeks to navigate great-competition power compromising without its non-aligned stance. These geopolitical dynamics highlight the importance of multilateralism in Indonesia's policy. As the 2023 ASEAN chair Indonesia demonstrated its commitment to regional stability by advancing initiatives for collective security economic and integration. Building on the momentum in 2025 Indonesia can leverage ASEAN's neutrality to mediate disputes and promote dialogue among competing powers.\nDomestic factors also shape Indonesia's foreign policy decisions. President Prabowo Subianto's administration faces mounting pressure to prioritize economic growth and job creation influencing decisions on foreign and investment trade agreements. Public sencreated_atnt plays a significant role with segments of the population expressing scepticism toward foreign influence, particularly from China. For instance, a 2024 survey indicated that 62% of Indonesians viewed Chinese investments with caution and concerns about citing and sovereignty labour practices. Additionally, Indonesia's military modernization efforts require balancing procurement from sources multiple—including U. S. China and Russia—maintain to strategic autonomy. This diversification strategy strains essential resources and complicates defence planning.\nDespite these challenges, Indonesia has significant opportunities to strengthen its foreign policy in 2025. Its strategic autonomy positions as a bridge between competing powers enabling it to secure benefits from all sides. For instance, Indonesia can leverage the U.S . -China's rivalry to attract investments competing in critical sectors like infrastructure technology and energy. In 2024, Indonesia signed agreements with both Chinese firms to develop renewable energy projects, demonstrating its ability to capitalise on great-power competition.\nIndonesia's role as a regional leader in ASEAN and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) provides another avenue for influence. By championing multilateral Indonesia's initiatives can promote collective security and economic integration while mitigating the impact of great-power rivalries. For example, Indonesia's efforts to mediate South China Sea disputes through ASEAN mechanisms enhance its credibility as a neutral arbiter. Furthermore Indonesia's focus on climate change and sustainable development with aligns global priorities creating opportunities for collaboration with U. S, China, and Russia on clean energy projects and environmental initiatives. Such partnerships not only address global but challenges also position Indonesia as a leader in the green transition.\nEconomic diversification is critical to reducing Indonesia's dependency on any single power. Strengthening ties with emerging economies and regional partners such as India Japan and South Korea can enhance Indonesia's economic resilience. For example, expanding trade with India which grew by 12% in 2024 offers opportunities to tap into one of the world's fastest-growing markets. Similarly deepening cooperation between Japan and South Korea in technology and infrastructure can complement Indonesia's development goals.\nIn conclusion, Indonesia's foreign policy in 2025 reflects a complex balancing act as its relationships navigate with the United States, China, and Russia. Economic dependencies geopolitical pressures and domestic constraints pose significant challenges. However, Indonesia's strategic autonomy leadership and commitment to multilateralism pathways provide these to navigate challenges effectively. By fostering economic diversification advancing diplomatic initiatives and addressing security regional concerns Indonesia can strengthen its position as a pivotal player in the Indo-Pacific. As the global order continues Indonesia's ability to evolve to adapt and innovate in its foreign policy will determine its role in shaping the future of the region beyond.\nThe opinions expressed in this article are the author's own.\nReferences\n  - Acharya, Amitav.

    "title": "Military leaders should expect Trump crackdown – from disloyalty to diversity",
    "created_at": "2025-01-20",
    "text": "\nAs Donald Trump  returns to office once again to be commander-in-chief, some of the generals and admirals he commands may wonder if his first order to them will be: “You’re fired.”\nEven as a potential war brewing with China  over Taiwan  and the South China Sea  looms large in the plans of Congress and the general staff, Trump and his team have said that they intend for the most senior military leaders to be loyal to the president’s agenda – and to the president himself – in ways that close observers of military leadership and organization find troubling.\n“One of the most important norms in American civil-military relations is that the military is responsive to elective leadership, irrespective of anytext’s politics,” said Kori Schake, senior fellow and the director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. Subjecting general officers to a political litmus test “will convey to the American public that their military leadership is political, and that will diminish trust in the military. It will hurt recruiting and retention, and it will fundamentally change the way the American public looks at its military leadership. I think it’s a terrible idea. I hope President Trump doesn’t adopt it,” Schake added.\nAnd yet, this is what Trump has vowed to do. The questions are when, and how, and to whom.\nThe American Accountability Foundation, a conservative activist organization helmed by a former Republican Senate staffer, began circulating a list  of 20 colonels, generals and admirals last month who had expressed support for diversity and inclusion initiatives  in the military, such as they are.  Adm Lisa Franchetti, chief of naval operations – the service chief for the US navy, is the highest-ranking officer of the list. Many on the list are intelligence chiefs or commanders in Europe or Asia.\nA Wall Street Journal report  widely cited by military observers said the incoming administration would create “warrior boards” of retired military commanders friendly to the Trump agenda to review – and purge – officers who had supported anti-racist initiatives.\nThe issue arose directly during confirmation hearings  for Trump’s embattled nominee for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth.  The US senator Jack Reed, a Democrat representing Rhode Island and ranking member on the Senate armed service committee, described “purge panels” under consideration by the incoming administration.\nReed asked  Hegseth to explain why military officers who upheld anti-discrimination laws and policies enacted under both Democratic and Republican administrations should be punished for that effort. Reed referenced emails in which Hegseth advocated firing “any general who has carried water for Obama and Biden’s extra-constitutional agenda-driven transformation of our military. Clean house and start over.”\nHegseth argued in response that no general officer had been held accountable for the botched US withdrawal in Afghanistan , and that accountability was necessary.\n“The military was a forerunner in courageous racial integration,” Hegseth said, referring to integration orders after the second world war. “The DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] policies of today are not the same as what happened back then. They’re dividing troops inside formations, causing commanders to walk on eggshells.”\nHegseth dodged the question about whether “warrior boards” of retired senior officers would be convened to review the records of combatant commanders, service chiefs and others, suggesting that every senior officer would be reviewed.\n“The rhetoric, somecreated_ats from candidate Trump, but often from people around Trump, was really quite bombastic and extreme,” said Peter Feaver, a professor in Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy, and director of the Duke program in American grand strategy. “If you went on what they wrote or in TV interviews and stuff like that, you could come to the conclusion that there’s going to be bloodletting equivalent to Stalin’s purges from the 1930s.”\nFeaver suggests that the administration could make do by firing a few senior officers to check the anti-DEI box as a political victory and move on. “It would put everytext else on notice and say, if we did that to this person, we can to you,” he said. “It would be politicizing, unless there was actual cause because they had underperformed or violated something in some tangible way. If it’s just symbolic, it’s going to be politicizing, but that would be relatively minor and actually somewhat within the bounds of precedent.”\nShortly after Trump won the election, Reuters reported that the transition team was drawing up plans to fire senior officers. Howard Lutnick, the CEO of the Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald and a chair of the transition team, as well as Trump’s pick for commerce secretary – said in the days before the election that Trump made a mistake elevating officers who were “Democrats” to positions of authority.\n“He made a mistake. He thought they were generals. They were Democratic  generals,” Lutnick said, describing the former Trump secretary of defense Jim Mattis, former chief of staff Mark Kelly and other general officers who served in senior leadership as treasonous.\nThe Reuters report said one focus of the new administration would be purging general officers connected to retired general Mark Milley, former chair of the joint chiefs of the armed services under Trump. Milley has been sharply critical of Trump, describing him as “the most dangerous person in America” and “fascist to the core”.\nJoe Biden  issued a pre-emptive pardon  to Milley on Monday, almost as he was stepping out of the door  at the White House as president for the last created_at, to protect him in case Trump tries to have him prosecuted.\nTrump’s authority to fire a general – any general – isn’t at question, said Katherine Kuzminski, deputy director of studies and the director of the military, veterans and society program at the Center for a New American Security. Generals used to get fired all the created_at, she said. The question is why.\n“It is not unfair to say there needs to be accountability for general officers,” she said. “What is alarming … is if we’re going to be explicit about the fact that a uniformed leader who is not acting in a partisan way can’t have their job unless they align with the president they’re serving under: that raises a lot of questions about the profession of arms being able to self-regulate.”\nAppointing a general or admiral to an important billet like command of the Pacific fleet or commandant of the Marine Corps or running one of the military’s 11 combatant commands has long been an intricate process requiring months of preparation and internal debate. These jobs carry a rank of O-9 or O-10 in military terminology; a lieutenant general or general, vice-admiral or admiral. Any officer ranked O-4 or higher – a lieutenant commander in the navy or coast guard or a major in the other services – is confirmed by the Senate and serves at the pleasure of the president, Kuzminski said.\nOfficers at ranks O-9 and O-10 – lieutenant generals and vice-admirals and above – hold on to their higher rank as a result of being assigned a billet that carries that rank. These officer prepare for such roles over careers spanning decades, through both Republican and Democratic administrations, she said.\n“The president can choose not to accept a proposed individual for promotion or for assignment, and he can fire those who are currently in it,” Kuzminski said. “What he can’t do on his own is say, ‘I’m going to install my guy there, right?’ It still has to go through the promotion process within the service. So, if he were to relieve a combatant commander or a superintendent, then the process starts all over again to determine who the next candidate is, who’s eligible and competitive within the service.”\nIn 2023, the Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville exercised a rarely used privilege to block  the promotion of more than 400 senior military leaders – about half the senior general and admiral roles in the military – as part of a failed strategy, ultimately, to oppose new Pentagon rules that allow reimbursement for travel when a service member has to go out of state to get an abortion  or other reproductive care.\nImportant jobs were filled by acting leaders without the authority to initiate policy changes. About 500 officers landed in their roles all at once about a year ago, when Tuberville finally lifted the year-long hold. The military is still digging out of the hole, Feaver said.\n“A fairly well-tuned leadership management personnel system that was designed to create a smooth process and certain amount of predictability which families need … Tuberville disrupted all of that,” Feaver said. “It’s going to take a couple years of normality to finally get the things back to where it was before. But of course, if that normality is interrupted with large-scale arbitrary firings, then you’re just going to extend the damage, compound the damage and extend the length of it.”\nThe holds had an unintended side-effect, however: they gave conservatives arguing for purges evidence that the military could cope with the absence of a general or two.\n“They said, we could – we should – be firing 500 people,” Feaver said. “That number was close to the number that Senator Tuberville had put a hold on. And so, they’re saying, ‘Yeah, we could remove that many and it wouldn’t hurt the country.’ Which, of course, was nonsense. But it was nonsense that they had to say in order to minimize the damage being done by Senator Tuberville.”\n"

    "text": "\nJanuary 20th, 2025 ( 24/7 Wall St.  - Delivered by  Newstex )\nWhen active-duty troops are in need of extra support, military reserves step in to take up the slack.This usually occurs during warcreated_ats or moments of intense threat from enemy nations.The group of men and women who make up the military reserves do not train full created_at the way active service members do.In fact, they are considered civilians.However, they are more capable of helping to defend the country than the average citizen, as they undergo consistent training.Some countries maintain extensive military reserves as part of their defense strategy, while others do not have the interest (or the manpower) to do so.For example, Kuwait does not have a large reserve force.However, since the Gulf War, the small nation has sought to continually strengthen its reserves with well-trained individuals.In contrast, the huge nation of India has a massive military reserve force known as the Territorial Army.This arsenal of emergency soldiers includes highly trained and versatile people capable of stepping in when necessary.24/7 Wall St. is taking a closer look at the armies of Asia to identify the Asian countries with the largest military reserve forces.We reviewed the  2024 Military Strength Ranking from Global Firepower, an annually updated defense-related statistics website with information on 145 countries.Countries were ranked on the total number of reserve personnel.We included supplemental information regarding total personnel, active personnel, total population, fit-for-service, and overall military strength score.Countries without a reserve force were excluded.Why Are We Covering This?Understanding the military dynamics of Asia is important considering the region's complex geopolitical landscape and its growing strategic significance.Historically, Asia has been shaped by internal conflicts, border disputes, and great power competition.Today, its military forces play an important role in determining regional stability.As tensions rise over territorial claims and political influence, military power is the law of the land, from disputes in the South China Sea to the contested borders in South Asia.Here is a look at the largest reserve forces in Asia:\n35.Qatar\nReserves: 15,000\nActive personnel: 66,550\nParamilitary forces: 5,500\nTotal military personnel: 87,050\nTotal population: 2,532,104\nFit-for-service: 486,164\nMilitary strength score and world rank: 1.0789 -

    "text": "\nKey View\nTensions in the South China Sea have escalated, with incidents between Mainland China- and Philippines-based coastguard vessels becoming more frequent and increasing in intensity.\nThe strains in Beijing-Manila relations will push the Philippines towards closer security cooperation with the US.\nWe believe that Manila will refrain from seeking direct US intervention in its maricreated_at territorial clashes with China due to the latteraEURtms importance as a trade partner.A\nAs expected, tensions in the South China Sea have escalated, as Mainland China and the Philippines attempt to assert their overlapping territorial claims. President Ferdinand MarcosaEURtms clear shift in foreign policy towards the US and its allies (Japan and Australia) since taking office in 2022 has led to an erosion in bilateral relations with China. This raises the risk of the Philippines becoming more deeply affected by the greater struggle for influence between Beijing and Washington in the Indo-Pacific region.A\nTerritorial disputes in the South China Sea will remain a key point of contention and are unlikely to abate anycreated_at soon. Confrontations between China- and Philippines-based security forces have become more frequent and intense in the last few months, with tensions eventually leading to a collision between China- and Philippines-based coast guard vessels near the disputed Scarborough Shoal on August 19 2024. It has been over a decade since a similar event occurred. However, tensions have cooled since the withdrawal of the largest Philippine Coast Guard vessel from the flashpoint. Despite this, the latest reports suggest that the Shoal has been surrounded by Chinese ships. The ongoing disputes will align the PhilippinesaEURtm current administration more closely with the US and other partners such as Japan and Australia. The Philippines and the US share a longstanding partnership, solidified by the Mutual Defense Treaty that they signed in 1951. The Philippines' pivotal geographic position, bridging the South China Sea and the Western Pacific Ocean, makes it an invaluable partner for the US. Although this alliance experienced a period of cooling when former president Rodrigo Duterte (2016-2022) favoured closer relations with China, President Marcos has reversed the course back towards the US.In a sign of deepening security ties, in 2023, President Marcos granted the US access to four additional military locations, bringing the total to nine. Some of these are situated near Taiwan, China, which will be a source of tension with Mainland China. A greater presence of US troops in the South China Sea could be perceived as a threat to China's sovereignty and interests, especially amid the ongoing contest of influence between Beijing and Washington in the Indo-Pacific region. The leaders of the US, Japan and the Philippines also held their first-ever trilateral summit in April 2024 for the purposes of strengthening ties.A The Philippines will refrain from seeking direct naval assistance from Washington.A The US Indo-Pacific Command commander has proposed US escorts for Philippine vessels as a response to Chinese moves in the South China Sea. However, deploying US forces directly to protect and resupply Philippine vessels would significantly raise the stakes and potentially challenge China to escalate the dispute. Not the US, China or the Philippines has an interest in raising tensions in the South China Sea at this created_at. In particular, the US is distracted by the latest increase in tensions in the Middle East and a new Trump's presidency, which will have bearing on China-US relations.A\nThe Philippines faces limits in how far it will confront China, given that China has emerged as the Philippines' largest trading partner, accounting for roughly 23% of total imports and 16% of exports, according to 2023 data. Currently, tensions in the South China Sea have not strained economic ties with China. However, Beijing has a history of using trade restrictions against markets with conflicting interests. For instance, China recently banned Japanese seafood imports after Japan decided to release treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean. Similarly, China imposed tariffs on Australian wine in 2021 when diplomatic relations with Australia deteriorated. The Philippines might face similar repercussions if tensions continue to rise.A \n"

    "text": "\n Analysts say the agreement 'commits both states to a status quo' and urge the Philippines to hold firm on its South China Sea stance   \nIn a rare moment of accord amid their simmering feud over the South China Sea, Beijing and Manila have agreed to maintain a provisional deal allowing the Philippines to resupply a remote outpost at the Second Thomas Shoal - a move hailed as a \"win\" for Manila, albeit one fraught with uncertainty. \nThe agreement, reached during the 10th bilateral consultation mechanism (BCM) meeting in Xiamen on Thursday, comes as the Philippines continues to push back against what it calls a rising tide of Chinese incursions in the South China Sea. \nThe BCM, established as a forum for dialogue, has often been weighed down by the deep mistrust between the two neighbours. But this created_at, envoys described the talks as \"frank and constructive\", according to the Philippines' foreign affairs department. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nDespite the diplomatic veneer, tensions remain high. Just days before the meeting, Manila lodged a fresh protest against the deployment of China's 165-metre-long (180-yard-long) coastguard vessel 5901 - ominously dubbed \"the monster\" - which was spotted just 77 nautical miles (142km) off the Philippine coast. \nThe Philippines condemned the move as a violation of its exclusive economic zone, citing the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and Manila's recently enacted Maricreated_at Zones Act. \nChina, for its part, has shown no signs of toning down its presence in contested waters, including Scarborough Shoal, which it has controlled since a 2012 clash with Philippine forces. The shoal - known in the Philippines as Bajo de Masinloc - remains a flashpoint, and was the reason Manila filed an arbitration case against Beijing at The Hague. \nBeijing has dismissed the 2016 ruling that invalidated its expansive claim over much of the South China Sea. \nStill, the agreement on resupply missions represents a rare moment of compromise. For years, the Second Thomas Shoal has been a symbol of Manila's defiance, with the rusting BRP Sierra Madre - a World War II-era warship intentionally grounded on the shoal - serving as the Philippines' foothold. \nChinese coastguard vessels have repeatedly tried to block resupply efforts to the outpost, even resorting to aggressive tactics that led to a Philippine serviceman losing a thumb in a past skirmish. \nThursday's meeting \"shows that the Philippines is able to get [China] to agree to commit. It's a win,\" said Julio Amador, interim president of the Foundation for the National Interest and a trustee at the non-profit organisation Facts Asia. The agreement \"commits both states to a status quo\", Amador said. \nBut he was quick to caution against complacency, saying that Beijing would continue probing for vulnerabilities. He urged Manila to \"stop announcing to the world its weakness\" and adopt a more strategic approach. \nAt last week's meeting, the two sides also reportedly explored areas of cooperation, including ocean meteorology and coastguard collaboration. These proposals built upon a joint coastguard committee formed in 2016 and the \"direct communication line\" for maricreated_at concerns that Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr and China's Xi Jinping agreed to set up in January 2023. \nPhilippine Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Theresa Lazaro said the continued implementation of the resupply deal was essential to the \"de-escalation of tensions\" without compromising national interests. Both sides had \"exchanged views\" and \"acknowledged ... positive outcomes\", she said. \n\"Our position is clear and consistent, but so is our willingness to engage in dialogue,\" Lazaro added in a statement. \nBeijing and Manila reached a provisional agreement on Philippine resupply missions to the Second Thomas Shoal last year. \nGeopolitical analysts remain sceptical of China's intentions, however. Don McLain Gill, a lecturer in international relations at De La Salle University in Manila, said Beijing had a habit of \"throwing its weight around\" and warned that Manila must not compromise on its core interests. \n\"The most important thing is that we hold our ground and we stay consistent,\" he said. \nNational Security Council spokesman Jonathan Malaya recently admitted that the Philippines felt China was \"pushing us to the wall\" and said Manila may have to file another case against Beijing. \nBut analysts warn that litigation alone is unlikely to shift the dynamics in the South China Sea, where China's strategy of incremental encroachment has left its neighbours scrambling for answers. \nAs the Philippines prepares to host the next BCM later this year, the question remains: can these fragile agreements hold against the tide of escalating tensions? \nFor now, Manila has secured what some see as a tenuous victory. But in the high-stakes chessboard of the South China Sea, every move counts - and every misstep could tip the balance.  \n"

    "text": "\n As the world's attention turned towards Washington and Donald Trump's inauguration, the Pentagon was operating decisively under the radar   \nDays before Donald Trump's inauguration, Washington quietly deployed an aircraft carrier strike group to the disputed South China Sea and staged secretive naval drills with the Philippines. \nThe timing was deliberate and the message unmistakable, analysts say - it signalled the US' determination to continue challenging China's increasingly provocative actions and regional dominance. \nOver two days in waters near Palawan, US and Philippine forces held maricreated_at defence exercises, part of a broader series of Maricreated_at Cooperative Activities (MCA) that began in late 2023. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nThe drills on Friday and Saturday - kept under wraps until their conclusion - featured the USS Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group alongside Philippine vessels BRP Antonio Luna and BRP Andres Bonifacio. The exercises included tactical manoeuvres and communication drills aimed at bolstering interoperability between the two allies. \n\"With each exercise, we become increasingly prepared and effective in addressing the challenges ahead,\" said General Romeo Brawner Jnr, commander of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, on Sunday. \n\"This is a result of our shared commitment and mutual effort to safeguard our national interests, and secure a peaceful region.\" \nUS Rear Admiral Michael Wosje echoed this sencreated_atnt, describing the US-Philippine alliance as \"ironclad\" while emphasising the drills' role in maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific. \nBut the message wasn't just for Manila. Analysts say the timing and secrecy of the drills were squarely aimed at Beijing, which has ramped up military activities in the South China Sea in recent months. \nChina's deployment of its double carrier battle group and the \"monster\" - its 165-metre-long (180-yard-long) coastguard vessel - has stoked tensions in contested waters, particularly near Scarborough Shoal, a flashpoint claimed by both Manila and Beijing. \n\"These exercises send a clear message to China, serving as both a statement of resolve and a deterrent,\" said Chris Gardiner, CEO of the Institute for Regional Security in Canberra. \n\"The US has a defence treaty with the Philippines. The US military should and will be undertaking exercises based on threat assessments, not on domestic politics, and will do so until such created_at as the new commander in chief adopts new China or Philippines policies,\" he told This Week in Asia. \nGardiner dismissed talk of the US drills as \"secret\", however, saying they were merely not revealed ahead of created_at. The exercises should instead be viewed as \"an expression of US commitment to and capabilities with the Philippines\" and a sign that Washington was ready to act if deterrence failed, he said, noting China's recent displays of force in the region. \n\"It is crucial that such posturing does not go unanswered,\" Gardiner said, \"or else both China and allies may misread US levels of commitment\". \nOther analysts argued that Beijing's aggressive posturing often backfired. \"Sending the monster ship is creating more resentment,\" said Jose Antonio Custodio, a defence analyst and fellow at the Consortium of Indo-Pacific Researchers. \"It's China creating the conditions [for these responses].\" \nCustodio noted the irony: while Beijing is increasingly assertive, its military assets, including its conventionally powered carrier groups, still lag behind the US Navy's ageing but formidable Nimitz-class carriers. \nThe timing of the drills also indicated that the new Trump administration was likely to continue its policy on freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, Custodio said. \n\"It won't change. The actions may become more intense, but they will remain consistent,\" he told This Week in Asia. \"I would expect the Trump government to do the same policy in the Asia-Pacific region.\" \nThe South China Sea is a critical global trade route, with about a third of the world's maricreated_at trade - valued at more than US$3 trillion - passing through its waters annually. \nBeijing claims nearly the entire waterway, dismissing overlapping claims from neighbours such as the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. It also rejects a 2016 international arbitral ruling invalidating its claims, arguing the decision lacks legal merit. \nGeopolitical expert Arnaud Leveau, an assistant professor at Paris Dauphine University and researcher at the Asia Centre think tank in France, noted that while Trump was likely to push for stronger financial commitments from partners such as the Philippines, strategic interests and regional security concerns would endure. \n\"The security partnership between the US and the Philippines is a key component of the US presence in the region,\" he said, adding that strengthening alliances will only grow more critical as China's military capabilities expand. \nYet, the risks of escalation are ever-present. In June 2023, a Chinese warship came within 150 yards (137 metres) of the USS Chung-Hoon in the Taiwan Strait, forcing the US destroyer to alter course to avoid a collision. \nLucio Blanco Pitlo III, president of the Philippine Association of Chinese Studies and a research fellow at Asia-Pacific Pathways to Progress, warned that while the latest drills improve US-Philippine readiness, they won't necessarily de-escalate tensions. \n\"If something happens, the US and China can test their crisis management hotline,\" he said, underscoring the razor's edge diplomacy at play in the disputed waters.  \n"

    "text": "\nBy LI YANG | China Daily | Updated: 2025-01-21 06:54\nThe 2025 ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Retreat was convened on Sunday in Langkawi, Malaysia. The Retreat, with the theme \"Inclusivity and Sustainability\", is the first major meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this year.\nUnder the chairmanship of Malaysia, the ASEAN foreign ministers had candid and in-depth discussions on ASEAN's priorities in 2025. Their wide-ranging joint statement issued after the meeting conveyed the ASEAN members' common stance on many issues, ranging from the South China Sea maricreated_at disputes to the Ukraine crisis.\nOver the past four years, the Joe Biden administration of the United States has exerted tremendous pressure on ASEAN in a bid to coerce it to jump onto its anti-China bandwagon, and the Philippines under the Ferdinand Marcos Jr government has sought to leverage an advantage by acting as a proxy of the US in the region. Portraying itself as a victim of China's \"bullying\", the Philippines tried to drive a wedge between the regional organization and China.\nThese external and internal factors have to some extent taken a toll on regional solidarity, stability and cooperation.\nWith a new US administration taking office on Monday, the organization will hopefully have the opportunity to better exercise its strategic autonomy in foreign affairs and uphold an independent stance on many burning issues of regional and international concern.\nIn the document, the ASEAN foreign ministers reiterated their strong commitment to upholding regionalism and multilateralism, welcomed the progress of the negotiations on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, vowed to play a greater role in fostering a stable and predictable environment through adherence to the principles of international law, mutual respect, and the peaceful resolution of maricreated_at disputes, and underscored the importance of the full and effective implementation of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea in its entirety.\nThe ASEAN stance accords with that of China, and, if acted upon, will be conducive to promoting the organization's cooperation with China to seek proper solutions on the South China Sea issues.\nBesides, the ASEAN foreign ministers vowed to deepen cooperation under the ASEAN Plus Three (China, Japan and the Republic of Korea) cooperation framework, and welcomed substantive progress in the implementation of the ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation Work Plan (2023-27).\nWhile China, Japan and the ROK have been accelerating their efforts to mend ties in recent months, the ASEAN's strong support for a closer regional cooperation will help unleash the potential of the ASEAN Plus Three cooperation framework that is based on their structural complementarity and shared Asian values and culture.\nStanding at a new starting point, ASEAN is now in a better position to understand that it has no reason not to keep good relations with its neighbors, including China, and that no external forces should be allowed to assume the center of the stage in Southeast Asia except the regional countries themselves.\n"

It said another Chinese vessel, CCG-3304, approached the coast of Zambales at 120.38 kilometers.\n“Although the monster ship has departed, it is important to note that CCG-3304, its replacement, remains larger than the largest PCG vessel,” the Philippine side said, referring to the 97-meter muti-role response vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua.\nCCG-3304 is 111 meters long and 46 meters wide, it said.\nIt said the 83-meter French-built BRP Gabriela Silang “continues to diligently fulfill its patriotic mission of challenging the unlawful presence of the Chinese Coast Guard.”\nThe Philippine Coast Guard said it must confront illegal patrols “as it prevents China from normalizing such unlawful actions.” “If we fail to challenge this, China will succeed in establishing a precedent for its maricreated_at forces’ illegal patrols in the future.”\n“Therefore, no matter how long it takes, the PCG vessels will always be present to prevent China from changing the status quo,” it added.\nThe PCG said China’s “disregard of international law” is a matter of concern not only for the Philippine government but for the entire region and the international community.\n“If the People’s Republic of China feels emboldened to ignore UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) and unlawfully patrol the EEZ of other states, what will stop it from doing the same to additional countries?” it asked.\n“While some may argue they are prepared to defend their rights, isn’t that precisely what we are trying to prevent?” it added.\n“A world increasingly dominated by rising tensions among sovereign nations is not what we desire. This is why international law has been established — to ensure equality and uphold the sovereignty of all nations.”\nA United Nations-backed tribunal in 2016 voided China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea, as it ruled Scarborough Shoal, which Beijing has controlled since 2012, is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen.\nThe shoal, which Manila calls Bajo de Masinloc, is 241 kilometers off Zambales and is within the Philippines’ 200-nautical mile EEZ.\n"

    "title": "Malaysia's Anwar Ibrahim Says Global Trade Will Weather Trump's 'Initial Shock'",
    "created_at": "2025-01-21",
    "text": "\n In an interview with the Financial created_ats, Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim sought to reassure the global community about the future of international trade under the incoming Trump administration. While acknowledging the inevitable 'initial shock' of new tariffs and protectionist policies, Anwar expressed confidence that the global trading system would stabilize over created_at, emphasizing that the long-term benefits of trade interdependence would ultimately outweigh short-term disruptions.\n'I think you can expect some initial turbulence or uncertainty, but after five or six months, you stay the course,' Anwar said, adding that 'reason will probably prevail.' He emphasized that major U.S. companies and conglomerates have significant interests in foreign trade and investments, making it unlikely that prolonged trade barriers would be sustainable.\nAnwar's comments come as Donald Trump prepares to take office for a second term, with many in Asia concerned about potential economic fallout from his proposed high tariffs. Despite these anxieties, Anwar, who has spoken with key leaders such as China's Xi Jinping and the UAE's Mohammed bin Zayed, argued that the 'US wants to protect its own interests, but in the long term, trade barriers wouldn't help.' His diplomatic stance reflects a belief that global commerce, while temporarily disrupted, would eventually resume its course.\nA Shift in Regional Power Dynamics\nAnwar also pointed to the shifting balance of power in Southeast Asia, where the U.S. is seen to have lost ground to China due to diminished engagement. 'China in that sense takes a more positive attitude,' he explained, noting the growing presence of Chinese officials in Malaysia and the increasing Chinese investments in infrastructure projects. Anwar suggested that the U.S. had diverted its focus elsewhere, particularly with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and had reduced its active involvement in Asia.\n'Maybe they are focused on Europe, I don't know. But certainly, they have reduced placing importance on the region,' he told the FT. This observation underscores Malaysia's growing ties with China, a trend that has raised concerns among ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) partners, particularly regarding the contentious South China Sea disputes. While Malaysia maintains a delicate balance in its relations with both Washington and Beijing, Anwar acknowledged that his government has shifted closer to China in recent years.\nNavigating Tensions in the South China Sea\nAnwar's stance on the South China Sea was measured, highlighting Malaysia's position as a key player in regional security. Although Malaysia has avoided confronting China directly, Anwar underscored his country's efforts to engage diplomatically while taking a firm stand on its territorial claims. He also pointed to Malaysia's leadership role in ASEAN, where tensions over China's assertiveness are felt by many member states.\nWhen asked whether ASEAN under his leadership would adopt a tougher stance toward China, Anwar replied, 'Why do we need to be tough? We disagree on many foreign policy issues with the U.S. but we want them to be an important ally. Similarly with China, I don't think it's a matter of being tough against a strong, big neighbor.'\nReflections on Western Engagement and Trust Deficits\nIn the same interview, Anwar lamented the 'trust deficit' in Southeast Asia toward Western powers, particularly in light of their stance on issues like the Gaza conflict. He accused Western nations of hypocrisy, having supported Israeli military actions in Gaza while promoting democracy and human rights in Asia. Anwar argued that the West had offered little practical support to the region, focusing mainly on trade and investment without addressing deeper geopolitical concerns.\nOn domestic issues, Anwar also defended his decision to ease the jail conditions of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, convicted in connection with the 1MDB scandal. Anwar, who endured his own political imprisonment in the past, justified the move by highlighting that while he could not forgive corruption, the focus should be on recovering stolen funds rather than retribution.\n"

    "title": "Philippines Political Risk Key View",
    "created_at": "2025-01-21",
    "text": "\nCore Views\nPolitical Risk:A The overall outlook remains stable. The PhilippinesaEURtm political landscape is prone to aEUR~celebrityaEURtm culture and is often dominated by several political families that hold sway over regions within the country. For many years, there has been an insurgency in the southern part of the country. The composite score remains relatively stable, at 46.0, as of December 2024.\nGovernance: The Philippines is a long-established and vibrant democracy, enabling broad checks and balances on the government by the House of Representatives and the Senate. However, political institutions have long been dominated by 'political dynasties'. For example, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr is the son of a former president, and several of his predecessors have been related to past presidents. Many legislators are also the children of a previous generation of legislators. The significant intertwining of political spheres and major corporations has also given rise to an aEUR~oligarchicaEURtm ruling class. Although this dynastic phenomenon does not inherently cause instability, it creates a perception of a self-sustaining elite, posing challenges for newcomers to break into the political arena. This aspect of the political system potentially obstructs economic and political reforms. In December 2024, the Governance score stood at 35.6; however, there is a risk of it deteriorating.A\nSociety:A Due to its low GDP per capita, A the Philippines is vulnerable to social unrest. The uneven distribution of income is evident from the Gini coefficient, which stood at 40.2 in 2021. The rapid rate of population growth also dampens the rate of per capita GDP growth, compared with economies with lower fertility rates. With around 54% of the Philippine population under the age of 25, the high percentage of youth has historically been associated with higher risks of protest. However, the emigration of Philippine workers in search of employment abroad has acted as a form of relief, and the remittances of overseas workers provide a buffer for the economy, amounting to around 10% of GDP. The Philippines' Social Risk score stands at 45.7, as of December 2024.A\nSecurity:A The Philippines is engaged in a dispute with Mainland China regarding sovereignty in the South China Sea. Any intensification of this dispute could strain bilateral relations between Beijing and Manila. However, risks are mitigated by the PhilippinesaEURtm Mutual Defense Treaty with the US. Domestically, the Philippines faces security challenges from insurgent and radical groups, including Abu Sayyaf, the Maute group and the New PeopleaEURtms Army. There is a risk that skirmishes expand into more extensive and enduring confrontations, such as the Marawi Siege which took place in 2017. While the Security Risk score stands at 44.7 in December 2024, with tensions escalating in the South China Sea, it could potentially deteriorate.A\nElection Watch:A Mid-term legislative elections are scheduled for May 2025, and the next presidential election is scheduled for May 2028. Philippine presidents are not allowed to run for a second six-year term, so President Macros will step down. Vice President Sara Duterte has expressed interest in running for president, and her popularity places her as a clear favourite.\n"

However, a lot has happened since then, and the gloss of his aura has rubbed off and is now tarnished.\nMuch of the reason for that has been Xi's poor handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasingly restrictive surveillance and control over the minutest aspect of Chinese society, unstinting support for tsar Vladimir Putin and his war machine, and his failed economic policies.\n \n \nConsider too that Xi and a militant CCP have done nothing to endear themselves to other nations - as China grabbed territory in India and the South China Sea, tightened the screws against Taiwan, trampled on human rights in Xinjiang, and subjugated Hong Kong.

    "created_at": "2025-01-21",
    "text": "\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has long served as a cornerstone of stability and cooperation in Southeast Asia. Founded in 1967 it has played a vital role in fostering peace economic growth and regional dialogue among its ten member states. However, as the world becomes increasingly multipolar ASEAN's geopolitical competence faces heightened scrutiny. The bloc's ability to navigate this complex landscape in 2025 will depend on its capacity to strengthen internal cohesion enhance economic integration and assert itself as a mediator in global and regional conflicts all while addressing challenges posed by external interference internal disparities, and non-traditional security threats.\nHistorically ASEAN has been instrumental in promoting regional stability. The organization emerged during the Cold War as a platform to prevent conflicts among its member states and to counter external ideological influences. Its early success in fostering peace within a plagued region by territorial disputes and ideological divides is a testament to its effectiveness. ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) and its principle of non-interference have provided a framework for peaceful coexistence ensuring that member states resolve disputes through dialogue rather than confrontation. Furthermore, ASEAN has been pivotal in driving economic stability most notably through initiatives like the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), which has facilitated intra-regional trade and investment. This historical role as a stabilizing force underscores ASEAN's geopolitical significance.\nIn recent years ASEAN has achieved remarkable success in regional diplomacy and economic integration. Its role in mediating disputes such as those in the South China Sea highlights its importance as a platform for dialogue. Although the South China Sea disputes remain unresolved ASEAN's consistent emphasis on diplomacy has prevented these tensions from escalating into open conflict. The establishment of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)the world's largest free trade agreement, further demonstrates ASEAN's ability to foster economic cooperation among its member states and external partners. Additionally, ASEAN forums led such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the East Asia Summit (EAS) have enhanced the bloc's role as a convener of global powers, enabling it to shape regional security and economic agendas.\nHowever, despite achievements ASEAN faces significant challenges that threaten its geopolitical competence. The internal bloc is marked by in disparities economic development governance, politics and systems among its member states. For instance, Singapore enjoys one of the highest GDPs per capita in the world the countries like Myanmar and Cambodia lag significantly behind. This economic gap often translates into diverging national priorities complicating efforts to achieve consensus on critical issues. Additionally, ASEAN lacks enforceable mechanisms to address intra-regional disputes which undermines its ability to present a unified front. Fragmented response, to external pressures, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, further highlighted these internal divisions.\nExternally the intensifying rivalry between the United States and China poses a significant challenge to ASEAN's neutrality. Both powers seek to expand their influence in Southeast Asia often forcing ASEAN member states to choose sides. For example, the U. S. has ramped up its military presence in the region under its Indo-Pacific Strategy while China continues to assert its claims in the South China Sea and expand Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects in ASEAN countries. These competing influences risk fracturing ASEAN's cohesion, as member states prioritize bilateral relations with these powers over collective interests. Moreover the rise of other regional players, as such India and Japan, complicates further ASEAN's strategic calculations.\nNon-traditional security threats present a growing challenge. Climate change and environmental degradation have disproportionately affected Southeast Asia, rising with sea levels threatening low-lying countries like Vietnam and the Philippines disaster as typhoons and earthquakes are becoming more and more frequent straining severe state members' resources and capabilities. Cybersecurity threats and the rapid pace of digital expose ASEAN transformation to risks of cyberattacks and digital inequities. Transnational crimes including human trafficking, drug smuggling and terrorism add layer another of complexity to ASEAN's security landscape necessitating coordinated responses that are often hindered by differing national policies and priorities.\nTo address these challenges and bolster its geopolitical competence ASEAN must adopt a multifaceted strategy. Enhancing internal cohesion should be a top priority. Strengthening ASEAN's institutional framework such as by granting more authority to the Secretariat ASEAN can help improve coordination and decision-making. Bridging economic and political divides among state members requires targeted investments in capacity-building initiatives and infrastructure development in less developed countries. Establishing more robust conflict resolution mechanisms-such as binding agreements on dispute settlement-will further enhance ASEAN's unity.\nEconomic integration must also be deepened. Accelerating the implementation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) will facilitate seamless trade investment and flows, boosting the region's global competitiveness. Embracing the digital economy fostering and innovation are equally critical. For instance, expanding digital infrastructure and harmonizing regulations on e-commerce can help ASEAN leverage the opportunities presented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. These efforts will not only strengthen intra-ASEAN economic ties but also enhance the bloc's resilience external against economic shocks.\nIn the realm of regional security ASEAN must assert its role as a mediator and advocate for multilateralism. The \"ASEAN Way\" of consensus-building and non-confrontation remains a valuable diplomatic tool for managing tensions among major powers. By positioning itself as a neutral platform for dialogue ASEAN can mitigate the risk of U. S. -China rivalry spilling over into Southeast Asia. Moreover, ASEAN should expand its role in addressing non-traditional security threats by fostering regional cooperation on disaster preparedness cybersecurity and environmental sustainability.\nStrengthening external partnerships is another critical strategy. ASEAN must manage great-power competition maintaining a delicate balance between engaging with major powers and safeguarding its centrality. Diversifying strategic alliances-such as deepening ties with the European Union, Australia and Africa-can reduce dependency on any single power and enhance ASEAN's strategic autonomy. Promoting a rules-international based order through participation in global institutions like the United Nations further ASEAN's geopolitical relevance.\nIn conclusion, ASEAN's geopolitical competence in 2025 will depend on its ability to adapt to a rapidly evolving global landscape. While the bloc has demonstrated remarkable resilience and achievements in fostering regional stability and economic growth, it must significantly overcome internal and external challenges to remain the cornerstone of regional and global diplomacy. By enhancing internal cohesion, economic deepening integration asserting its role in regional security and externally strengthening partnerships ASEAN can navigate these complexities and reaffirm its position as a central player in the multipolar world. Adaptability and unity will be the key determinants of ASEAN's success in the years to come.\nIn this article, the author expresses his personal view.\nReferences\n - Acharya, Amitav.

    "title": "Philippines' arrest of Chinese 'sleeper agent' sparks fears of widespread spying",
    "created_at": "2025-01-21",
    "text": "\n A group comprising Deng Yuanqing and two Filipinos is accused of spying on Philippine military bases, including where US troops have access   \nPhilippine authorities have arrested a Chinese national suspected of conducting espionage operations, recovering equipment in his possession that they believe might have been used for spying on military facilities. \nLaw enforcers and military officials presented the suspect, identified as Deng Yuanqing, at a press conference in Manila on Monday, and two Filipinos who were allegedly also involved in the case. \nOfficials from the Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said Deng was a \"control engineering\" specialist and was arrested with his Filipino companions in Makati City on January 17. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nAuthorities added that Deng was affiliated with the Army Engineering University of PLA (People's Liberation Army), a military university based in Nanjing. \nNBI Director Jaime Santiago said local authorities received intelligence information about Deng and his group in December, indicating they had arrived in the Philippines to conduct surveillance on critical structures such as military bases and police camps. \nCybercrime chief Jeremy Lotoc said Deng, whom he dubbed a \"sleeper agent\", might have been in the Philippines for about five years based on his passport. \nDeng's group had even managed to visit sites under the Philippines' Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with the United States, Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Romeo Brawner warned. US troops are allowed access to selected military bases in the Philippines under EDCA. \nAuthorities found data-gathering devices in their possession capable of sending sensitive information, such as exact coordinates and topographic details, which could be used for military targeting or drone operations. \nThey added that Deng and his group were also found surveying other locations such as airports, seaports, power facilities, and shopping malls. \nThe Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request from This Week in Asia for comment. \nAnalysts said Deng's arrest was unsurprising, with Beijing seeking to exploit Manila's vulnerabilities as both sides remained embroiled in tensions over the disputed South China Sea. \nThe development happened just days after Chinese and Philippine diplomats met in Xiamen for the two countries' 10th bilateral consultation mechanism (BCM) meeting, during which Manila pushed back against what it believed were rising incursions by China's vessels in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. \nJulio Amador, interim president of the Foundation for the National Interest and a trustee at the non-profit organisation Facts Asia, said the arrests confirmed that China could run covert operations in the Philippines, including \"targeting our security infrastructures\". \nAmador said Manila should summon Beijing to demand an explanation of the activities of Deng's group and raise the matter in the next BCM. \nChester Cabalza, president of the Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, said the investigations showed sleeper agents \"have faces, which tell us to even be more wary of hybrid warfare in a hyperconnected world\". \n\"Cyber warriors look like any ordinary people with an extraordinary mission to gather information, scan and send data, and plot future scenarios to weaken our institutions,\" he said, adding that the incident would deepen Manila's doubts about Beijing's sincerity in establishing a credible BCM. \nSherwin Ona, an international fellow at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taiwan, said malign actors in China were long aware of ways to exploit the vulnerabilities of security and other systems in the Philippines, such as through the now-banned offshore gaming operators (Pogos), which had been suspected of carrying out espionage activities. \n\"In the past, we were complacent in accepting development assistance and loans [from Beijing], whose onerous terms can also be used to influence local officials. Plus, China knows the country has limited maricreated_at domain awareness and cyber abilities,\" Ona said. \nThe presence of EDCA sites in the Philippines posed a \"direct threat to the PRC's intention in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait\". \"Therefore, surveillance of these sites is crucial,\" he added. \nAnalysts believe such espionage cases will continue alongside other China-led cyber and disinformation acts. As such, Cabalza called for a robust national ID system in the Philippines to counter such activities. \nLast year, over 1,000 Chinese nationals were found to have acquired fraudulent identity documents in the Philippines, such as birth certificates and national IDs. \n\"The government should hasten a flawless system and legal remedy to include cyber espionage, severely punishable under our domestic laws,\" Cabalza said. \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "text": "\nLONDON, Jan. 21 -- Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has highlighted a \"trust deficit\" between the Western world and emerging economies, or Southeast Asia, due to its hypocrisy on certain geopolitical matters.\nIn an interview with UK-based Financial created_ats, he pointed to the Western world's support for Israel's military attacks against Palestinians in Gaza.\n\"There is a trust deficit among emerging economies because big powers have not followed the ground rules of basic international law,\" he was quoted saying.\nSimilarly in Southeast Asia, Anwar said the West had talked big about democracy and reform but did nothing to help.\n\"Nothing was done to assist [the region]. There's engagement only in trade and investment,\" he added.\nAnwar said that the United States has lost ground in the region compared to China, suggesting that its eyes may have moved to Europe due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\"We engage well with the US but it does not engage the region as actively as it did in the past. China in that sense takes a more positive attitude,\" he reportedly said, pointing to senior Chinese officials who visited Malaysia in recent created_ats.\n\"They give better access, you can meet them easily. We send ministers there, they send ministers.\"\nDespite that, Anwar said the US is still a valued investor in Malaysia, especially in the semiconductor industry.\n\"It's better for smaller economies such as Malaysia to extend its [ties] with China,\" he was quoted saying.\n\"The only contentious issue is the South China Sea [where China has conflicting territorial claims with some Asean member states] where we are engaging well and taking a strong position.\"\nAnwar also said that under Malaysia's chairmanship, Asean does not necessarily need to be confrontational with China - as the bloc needs the superpower as an ally.\n\"Why do we need to be tough? We disagree on many foreign policy issues with the US but we want them to be an important ally.\n\"Similarly with China I don't think it's a matter of being tough against a strong, big neighbour,\" he reportedly said.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

    "created_at": "2025-01-21",
    "text": "\nThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:\nSoutheast Asia is greeting Donald Trump's return to the White House with a mix of hope and hesitation as he embarks on his second term as U.S. president.\nTrump took the oath of office on Monday inside the Capitol after the ceremony was moved indoors because of weather reports that a polar vortex would bring frigid temperatures to the nation's capital.\nEven as regional leaders anticipate greater engagement with the United States, a controversial moment involving his defense secretary nominee, Pete Hegseth, has raised concerns about how the administration will treat relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.\nHegseth, a former Army National Guard officer and television commentator, was unable to name ASEAN member states or identify the bloc's size during his confirmation hearing last week, drawing criticism both in Washington and across Southeast Asia.\n\"He doesn't understand that the Defense Department's work in the South China Sea, where the U.S. plays a major role, involves many ASEAN countries,\" Isa Gharti, a public policy researcher at Chiang Mai University in Thailand, told RFA affiliate BenarNews. \"This lack of understanding could bring problems to ASEAN countries in the long term.\"\nASEAN has been central to Washington's strategy in the Indo-Pacific. The bloc, which includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore among its 10 members, represents more than 680 million people and collectively forms the world's fifth-largest economy.\nThe United States counts two other ASEAN nations, Thailand and the Philippines, as treaty allies and has sought to deepen ties with the group to counter China's growing influence in the region. The U.S. military has access to nine Philippine bases.\nChina has made significant inroads in Southeast Asia, investing in infrastructure projects and using its economic clout to build partnerships. The South China Sea, where Beijing's territorial claims overlap with those of several ASEAN nations, remains a key flashpoint in the region.\nWhile Hegseth fumbled in responding to questions from Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who was born in Bangkok and injured in combat while serving in the U.S. military, regional leaders have expressed optimism about U.S. engagement under Trump's leadership.\nIndonesian President Prabowo Subianto has congratulated Trump on his victory and expressed his desire for a personal meeting.\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim hailed Trump's election a \"remarkable political comeback\" and voiced optimism about the potential for a deeper partnership with the United States.\nAnalysts react\nRaden Mokhamad Luthfi, a defense analyst at Universitas Al Azhar Indonesia, said he is skeptical about future defense relations between the United States and Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country, citing what he described as Hegseth's and Trump's unfavorable views of Muslims.\nCristina Palabay, secretary general of the Philippine rights group Karapatan, accused Washington of using allies including the Philippines to further its strategic goals.\n\"Trump's hostility toward China certainly matches, if not surpasses, that of Biden,\" Palabay said.\nIn Bangkok, Phumtham Wechayachai, Thai deputy prime minister and defense minister, struck a cautious tone.\n\"After Trump's inauguration as U.S. president, we need to see what adjustments may be needed,\" Phumtham told reporters. \"Overall, the foundation of U.S.-Thai relations is already good. We will consider any proposals according to Thai principles and make any adjustments that benefit the nation.\"\nOther analysts suggested that Hegseth's misstep might not significantly impact U.S. engagement with the region.\n\"It would be folly to assume that just because the secretary of defense may not be familiar with ASEAN, that is tantamount to weaker U.S. engagement,\" said Julio Amador, a geopolitical analyst based in Manila. \"The Pentagon is a huge bureaucracy and Hegseth's deputies are well-versed in the geopolitics of the Indo-Pacific.\"\nMuhammad Waffaa Kharisma, a researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta, argued that ASEAN is not strategically significant to the United States.\n\"Perhaps some ASEAN member states are, but ASEAN as an institution isn't, especially in an era when enthusiasm for multilateral organizations has waned,\" Waffaa told BenarNews.\nHe added that Trump's first term as president was \"not particularly enthusiastic\" about ASEAN.\n\"They came up with initiatives which were seen as undermining ASEAN, including the Quad,\" he said, referring to a security dialogue among the United States, Japan, India and Australia.\n'Limited awareness'\nAsrul Hadi Abdullah Sani, a partner at ADA Southeast Asia, a regional consultancy firm, said Hegseth's \"gaffe underscores the limited awareness of ASEAN in American political circles.\"\nStill, concerns remain about the Trump administration's long-term priorities.\n\"We will need to plan for a worst-case scenario in which Trump and Xi will reach a modus vivendi that sacrifices the Philippines' national interests,\" Rommel Jude Ong, a retired Philippine Navy rear admiral, told BenarNews while calling for stronger ties with other regional powers such as Japan and Australia. Xi is Xi Jinping, China's president.\nMeanwhile, a social media user in Southeast Asia questioned Hegseth's comments.\n\"Not having heard of ASEAN doesn't mean it doesn't exist. All of us here in the ASEAN are cringing over what's happening over there in the West,\" a Filipina who goes by the username @tessgarcia wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"Geography-challenged people like Hegseth are probably the reason the U.S. lost in Vietnam (an ASEAN country).\"\nJason Gutierrez and Gerard Carreon in Manila, Jon Preechawong in Bangkok, Iman Muttaqin Yusof and Iskandar Zulkarnain in Kuala Lumpur, Pizaro Gozali Idrus and Tria Dianti in Jakarta contributed to this report.\n"

    "text": "\nBAKU, Azerbaijan, January 21. The European Commission to present its new Competitiveness Compass next week, said President of the Commission Ursula von der Layen with her special address during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trend reports.\nShe pointed out that the cooperative world order we imagined 25 years ago has not turned into reality. Instead, we have entered a new era of harsh geostrategic competition.\n\"The world's major economies are vying for access to raw materials, new technologies, and global trade routes. From AI to clean tech, from quantum to space, from the Arctic to the South China Sea, the race is on. As this competition intensifies, we will likely continue to see frequent use of economic tools such as sanctions, export controls, and tariffs that are intended to safeguard economic and national security.\nBut it is important that we balance the imperative to safeguard our security against our opportunity to innovate and enhance our prosperity. In this spirit, we will need to work together to avoid a global race to the bottom, because it is in no one's interest to break the bonds of the global economy. Rather, we need to modernize the rules to sustain our ability to produce mutual gain for our citizens,\" said the Commission's president.\nShe went on to add that for Europeans, the race begins at home.\n\"Europe has a unique social market economy. We have the second largest economy and the biggest trading sector in the world. We have longer life expectancy, higher social and environmental standards, and lower inequalities than all our global competitors. Europe is home to immense talent, along with a proven ability to attract ideas and investment from across the world. Our capacity to invent and create is underappreciated. Europe's global share of patent applications is on par with the U.S. and China. But the world is changing. So must we,\" said Ursula von der Layen.\nShe recalled that for the last 25 years, Europe has relied on the rising tide of global trade to drive its growth.\n\"It has relied on cheap energy from Russia. And Europe has too often outsourced its own security. But those days are gone. To sustain our growth in the next quarter of a century, Europe must shift gears. And this is why I asked Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, to deliver a report on European competitiveness. And on that basis, next week the European Commission is presenting our roadmap, the Competitiveness Compass, which will drive our work for the next five years. The focus will be increased productivity by closing the innovation gap,\" she said.\nFollow the author on X: @Lyaman_Zeyn\n"

Alejandra Angarita acknowledged an email request for additional information on the deployment but was unable to provide a response by Tuesday afternoon.\nThe day of their arrival, at least one of the Lancers completed an aerial refueling over the South China Sea with a KC-135 Stratotanker assigned to 909th Air Refueling Squadron at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, according to a separate series of photos posted Thursday on Facebook by the 18th Wing.\nAlso that day, a pair of Lancers were escorted in an airpower demonstration over the Sea of Japan, or East Sea, by South Korean F-15K Slam Eagles and Japan Air Self-Defense Force Mitsubishi F-2 fighters, the first overflight by U.S. allies of the new year. The Air Force did not identify the Lancers' home station.\nThe Air Force routinely deploys Lancers, B-52 Stratofortress and B-2 Spirit bombers to Guam and elsewhere around the world on task force missions, which began in January 2018 and have continued regularly since 2020.

    "text": "\n The first major diplomatic event of the second presidency of Donald Trump will take place Tuesday, a day after his inauguration, bringing together the top diplomats of the United States, Japan, Australia and India to discuss major challenges in the Indo-Pacific amid China's rise in the region.\n Marco Rubio, who was swiftly confirmed by the Senate as secretary of state on Monday, will attend a meeting of the grouping known as the Quad in Washington, indicating that the new Trump administration could be more supportive of multilateral cooperation than has been generally expected.\n Rubio, a former Florida senator, has taken a hard-line approach to China that aligns with Trump's stance. In his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, he said China is \"the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary\" the United States has ever confronted.\n Rubio is almost certain to put China on the agenda in the talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.\n The diplomatic partnership of the four democracies was raised to the foreign ministerial level in 2019 during Trump's first presidency.\n His predecessor Joe Biden elevated the Quad to the leader level in 2021. He hosted the first in-person Quad summit in September of that year in Washington.\n Inviting the Japanese, Australian and Indian foreign ministers to Trump's inauguration ceremony and organizing the meeting just after he returned to the White House on Monday suggests that the new administration places special value on the four-way partnership.\n The Quad's origins date back to when the four countries coordinated their emergency responses and humanitarian aid following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.\n The Quad is not a security alliance but has often been regarded as a counterweight to China's growing influence. The areas of cooperation have been expanding in recent years, ranging from maricreated_at safety and infrastructure to health security and emerging technologies.\n Biden hosted a Quad summit last September in his home state of Delaware, at which the leaders used some of the strongest language that the group has ever issued. Without mentioning China by name, they voiced \"serious concern\" over \"the militarization of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating maneuvers in the South China Sea.\"\n \"We condemn the dangerous use of coast guard and maricreated_at militia vessels, including increasing use of dangerous maneuvers,\" they said.\n Notable new initiatives announced at that created_at included launching joint coast guard exercises. The move was seen as augmenting the security aspect of the Quad and sending a strong signal to China that its assertive maricreated_at actions against smaller countries such as the Philippines are unacceptable.\n While the four countries have repeatedly underscored that they have come together to share values such as democratic governance and the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, China has criticized the Quad as an Asian version of NATO aimed at containing its rise.\n==Kyodo\n"

Beijing's sweeping claims encompass much of the South China Sea, including the Philippines' internationally recognized maricreated_at zone. Clashes between the neighbors' coast guards have resulted in several Philippine injuries and raised the specter of Manila's Mutual Defense Treaty with Washington.\nFurther fueling anti-China sencreated_atnt is the case of Alice Guo, a mayor accused of spying for China and having links to illegal online scamming centers, often run by Chinese nationals and tied to criminal activities such as human-trafficking. Guo has pled not guilty.\nWhat to Know\nThe NBI on Friday arrested a Chinese national with the surname Deng, and two male Philippine associates, called Besa and Fernande.\nThe law enforcement action followed a bureau investigation triggered by naval operatives' report on a group of Chinese citizens suspected of conducting surveillance under the guise of developing an autonomous vehicle.\nOfficials learned Deng, a software engineer specializing in control engineering, has connections with China's military-affiliated People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, according to a bureau press release.\nThe bureau identified three other suspects in the surveillance operation, including two unnamed hardware engineers and a financier, a woman known as Wang. All three individuals are believed to be in China.\nDeng was operating ICT equipment when officials approached the car in Metro Manila's Makati City. Asked about his identity and to provide authorization, Deng tried to hide his equipment and flee, prompting the officials to take him and his companions into custody.\nA search of the equipment in the vehicle revealed a range of sensitive information \"comprising topographic footage mapping the critical infrastructures of the Philippines, among others,\" the report said. \nThe vehicle was tracked \"traversing to and fro\" on Luzon island as Deng collected detailed imaging data from between December 13, 2024, and January 16.\nNBI Cybercrime Division head Jeremy Lotoc told reporters Monday that Deng is suspected of being a \"sleeper\" agent or mole who has been in the Philippines for five years, the Philippine Inquirer reported.\nFernandez and Besa reportedly admitted to having acted as Deng assistant and driver, taking the engineer to police and military headquarters as well as government offices and power installations, the Inquirer cited officials as saying.\nThe military sites of interest included those being jointly operated alongside the U.S. under the allies' Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, Philippine armed forces chief Romeo Brawner Jr. told reporters.\nWhat People Are Saying\nEduardo Ano, the Philippine national security adviser, said:\n\"The recent apprehensions highlight the need for continuous vigilance, strengthened coordination among government agencies and proactive measures to fortify our national security framework.\"\nThe Armed Forces of the Philippines wrote on X (formerly Twitter):\n\"The AFP remains vigilant in its duty to defend the country against all kinds of threats to national security.\"\nWhat's Next\nAno urged the Philippine Congress to prioritize passing the Countering Foreign Interference and Malign Influence Bill and pending amendments to the Espionage Act.\n\"Strengthening our legal framework is essential to effectively address evolving security threats and ensure that those who seek to compromise our national security will face the full force of the law,\" he added.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nSuspects in Philippine Espionage Case\nArmed Forces of the Philippines\nThe three men arrested on suspicion of illegal surveillance, Deng, Fernande, and Besa, are presented at a press conference on January 20.\n"

In his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, he said China is \"the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary\" the United States has ever confronted.\n Rubio is almost certain to put China on the agenda in the talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.\n Arriving at the State Department for his first day ahead of the meeting, Rubio delivered remarks in which he reminded officials that voters decide the course of the United States and they have elected Trump.\n \"Our foreign policy is centered on one thing, and that is the advancement of our national interest,\" Rubio said, telling them also that \"there will be changes\" in the way the department operates, but such moves were not meant to be \"destructive\" or \"punitive.\"\n He stressed that the agency needs \"to move faster than we ever have, because the world is changing faster than we ever have.\"\n The diplomatic partnership of the four democracies was raised to the foreign ministerial level in 2019, during Trump's first presidency.\n His predecessor Joe Biden elevated the Quad to the leader level in 2021 and hosted the first in-person Quad summit in September of that year in Washington.\n Inviting the Japanese, Australian and Indian foreign ministers to Trump's inauguration ceremony and organizing the meeting just after he returned to the White House on Monday suggests that the new administration places special value on the four-way partnership.\n The Quad's origins date back to when the four countries coordinated their emergency responses and humanitarian aid following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.\n Although the Quad is not a security alliance, it has often been regarded as a counterweight to China's growing influence. Its areas of cooperation have been expanding in recent years, ranging from maricreated_at safety and infrastructure to health security and emerging technologies.\n The four countries have repeatedly underscored that they have come together to share values such as democratic governance and the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, but China has criticized the Quad as an Asian version of NATO aimed at containing its growing influence.\n Biden hosted a Quad summit last September in his home state of Delaware, at which the leaders used some of the strongest language ever issued by the group. Without mentioning China by name, they voiced \"serious concern\" over \"the militarization of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating maneuvers in the South China Sea.\"\n \"We condemn the dangerous use of coast guard and maricreated_at militia vessels, including increasing use of dangerous maneuvers,\" they said.\n Notable new initiatives announced at the created_at included the launching of joint coast guard exercises. The move was seen as augmenting the security aspect of the Quad and sending a strong signal to China that its assertive maricreated_at actions against smaller countries such as the Philippines were unacceptable.\n==Kyodo\n"

    "text": "\n The US Typhon mid-range missile system provides the capability to help defend the Philippines' maricreated_at interests, according to Washington's top diplomat in the country.\nAmbassador MaryKay Carlson stated that the US is working with Philippine authorities in accordance with the Philippines' Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept, which is 'a very important way of assessing or visualizing the archipelagic nation.'\n'It's about defending your interests in your territorial seas, certainly, but also in your exclusive economic zone (EEZ),' Carlson said during her visit to The STAR office in Parañaque last Thursday.\n'We're working together hand in hand, day in, day out on what we can do together to defend our mutual interests in this region,' she added.\nThe US Army deployed the mid-range missile system in the northern Philippines last year for the Balikatan, the annual joint military exercises with its longcreated_at ally.\nIt has been used by Philippine armed forces to train for their operations.\n'We'll be using it for training, and it's a system that we think is useful for our troops to have the capability to use. It's so important to understand that there are exercises and we have 500-plus different types of exercises or engagements, military to military,' Carlson said.\nThe Philippines plans to acquire the US Typhon, also known as the strategic mid-range fires system, that can launch Tomahawk cruise missiles capable of hitting targets up to 2,000 kilometers away.\nIt is crucial in coastal defense and protecting the country's sovereignty against foreign threats.\n'So it's really important that we have the ability to train together on these complex systems, the fact we've heard a number of calls on the part of the Philippine government to have the system remain here to purchase one. That's something that is certainly under discussion. The Philippines is our oldest treaty ally in this region,' Carlson emphasized.\nChina has urged the Philippines to promptly pull out the Typhon missile system, telling Manila that the 'world needs peace and not a mid-range missile system.'\nThe Philippines maintained that China must respect the country's decisions on its defense and security as the government plans to acquire a missile system from the US.\nNational Security Adviser Eduardo Año branded as unfounded and pure speculation China's criticism that the Philippines' efforts to enhance its defense and deterrence capabilities, specifically the deployment of the Typhon missile system, are part of a broader arms race or pose a threat to the region or any country.\nSustained efforts\nMeanwhile, the Philippine Coast Guard will sustain its efforts to drive Chinese forces out of the West Philippine Sea 'no matter how long it takes,' according to PCG spokesman on WPS concerns Commodore Jay Tarriela.\nThe PCG's 83-meter offshore patrol vessel BRP Gabriela Silang saw the changing of two patrol ships of the China Coast Guard (CCG) with bow numbers 5901 - said to be the world's largest coast guard ship at 165 meters and 12,000 tons - and 3304 that is 111 meters long.\n'At approximately 3 p.m., CCG-5901 moved further away from the PCG vessel, while another vessel, CCG-3304, approached the coast of Zambales,' Tarriela said in his latest nightly advisory last Sunday.\nHe noted that CCG 5901 was detected 'at an approximate distance of 95 nautical miles from the coast of Zambales' while CCG 3304 was around '65 nautical miles' from the shores of the province.\nPersonnel onboard Gabriela Silang sent radio challenges to both CCG vessels, asserting they were violating Republic Act 12064, or the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, of which China is a 'signatory party,' and the 2016 Arbitral Award.\nThe ruling upheld the Philippines' sovereign rights over its 200-nautical-mile EEZ and rejected China's expansive claim over the entire South China Sea.\nIn a post on his X account yesterday, Tarriela asserted that if the PCG would not challenge China's trespassing in the WPS, China 'will succeed in establishing a precedent for its maricreated_at forces' illegal patrols in the future.'\n'Therefore, no matter how long it takes, the PCG vessels will always be present to prevent China from changing the status quo,' he wrote. - Ghio Ong, Bella Cariaso\n"

Many on their return to the cities found jobs in state-run industries.\nHan, 70, rose up the ranks in the financial center of Shanghai during the 1980s and 1990s, just as China's economy was catching fire, concurrently holding Communist Party and managerial positions in the chemical and rubber industries.\nThere he caught the eye of senior leaders and was elevated to district-level governance before becoming the city's mayor and then party secretary, the city's highest position, following a financial scandal involving his predecessor. Xi had briefly held the position after the scandal, giving Han access to him before him became China's new leader.\nIn 2017, Han reached the apex of Chinese political power, the party's seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and after serving one five-year term was given the position of vice president, a position Xi has imbued with new weight as adviser and envoy.\nThroughout his career, Han has shown a flair for low-key diplomacy, helping to deal with unrest in Hong Kong and attending numerous international events such as the United Nations General Assembly.\nYesterday [Macau created_at], Han met with U.S. Vice President-elect J.D. Vance and U.S. business leaders, including Elon Musk, in Washington on the eve of the inauguration.\nHan Zheng, who serves as an envoy for Chinese President Xi Jinping at the inauguration, \"discussed a range of topics including fentanyl, balancing trade and regional stability\" with J.D. Vance, according to the Trump transition team.\nHan stressed the \"extensive common interests and enormous space of cooperation\" the United States and China share in economic and trade relations despite \"some disagreements and frictions,\" according to a readout of his meeting with Vance issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry yesterday.\nTrump has threatened to impose tariffs and other measures against China in his second term, while also hinting and ways in which the two rival powers could cooperate on issues such as regional conflicts and curbing the export of substances used in the production of fentanyl.\nIn an unorthodox move, Trump last month invited Xi to his inauguration. No head of state has previously made an official visit to the U.S. for the inauguration, according to State Department historical records.\nWhile Xi will not personally attend the event, he and Trump held a phone call last week during which they discussed trade, fentanyl and TikTok. The Chinese social media app restored service to users in the U.S. yesterday, just hours after it went dark in response to a federal ban, which Trump said he would pause by executive order yesterday.\nHan also met with Musk and other top U.S. business executives, including representatives of the U.S.-China Business Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C., according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\nThe Chinese vice president reiterated promises for an improved business environment for foreign firms in China and expressed hopes that U.S. companies will continue expanding investment in the country.\nMusk, whose company Tesla operates a factory in Shanghai, posted on his platform X after the meeting that he has long opposed the TikTok ban \"because it goes against freedom of speech.\"\n\"That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced,\" he wrote. \"Something needs to change.\"\nX is banned in China alongside other major U.S. social media and news apps and websites, including YouTube, Google, Facebook and many major U.S. media.

    "text": "\n China's rotating fleet of massive Coast Guard vessels off Zambales has compelled local fishermen to move with extra caution while venturing out to sea, a fisherfolk federation leader said Tuesday, January 21.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard marked its 16th day yesterday challenging the presence of Chinese vessels prowling illegally in the waters off Zambales, well within the country's 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone.\nWhile Beijing's CCG vessel 5901, dubbed the \"monster ship\" due to its massive size, moved away this weekend, it was immediately replaced by CCG vessel 3304 - a 111-meter ship that still dwarfs the PCG's biggest ship, the 96-meter BRP Teresa Magbanua.\nIn response, the PCG has maintained its deployment of the 84-meter BRP Gabriela Silang to monitor China's vessels. It also issues hourly radio challenges.\nLeonardo Cuaresma, who chairs the Federated Association of Fisherfolk in Masinloc, described a tense situation at sea where China has deployed not just its coast guard vessels but also its maricreated_at militia to conduct coordinated patrols up to 50 nautical miles from where local fishermen operate.\n\"Our fishermen there, our companions, and other organizations here in the province of Zambales, it's true that we've been discussing this, and they have concerns about this matter because the monster ship remains stationed in front of Capones,\" Cuaresma said in Filipino in an interview with TeleRadyo on Tuesday.\nThe PCG first reported the presence of the 12,000-ton \"monster ship\" some 50 to 70 nautical miles off Capones Island in Zambales on January 4. Since then, PCG reports show the CCG vessel has only moved away upon the deployment of a reliever vessel.\nCuaresma onserved the same pattern. \"They don't leave. And when our forces are there, they just move away briefly but then come back again.\"\n\"They are well within our exclusive economic zone. Their massive ship is just about 40 nautical miles off Capones,\" he said.\nWhile local fishing boats regularly encounter these Chinese vessels at sea, they have so far been left alone.\n\"Actually, for now, they somecreated_ats encounter our commercial fishing vessels, but by God's grace, they don't interfere with our fishermen,\" he said.\nHowever, local fishers remain concerned about potential incidents at sea, particularly given the stark disparity in size between Philippine and Chinese vessels. \"We don't know, but if we make one wrong move, it could potentially endanger our fishermen,\" Cuaresma said.\nRadio challenges from the Philippine Coast Guard appear to have limited effect, the fisherfolk leader added.\n\"They have no fear regarding this matter, except when the Philippine Coast Guard frequently conducts joint exercises. If the ships of the US, Japan, and some of our neighboring countries are present, there is a possibility that China's monster ship could be driven away,\" Cuaresma said in Filipino.\nAlready on edge\nCuaresma also explained that the constant presence of Chinese vessels has become even more concerning for the fishing community following the disappearance of several fishermen last month under unusual circumstances.\n\"Last month, some of our fishermen reportedly had their boats sink. The sea wasn't rough during that created_at and there was no bad weather,\" he said in Filipino. Only one fisherman from the group made it back - a crew member who had stayed aboard their mother boat. \"Those who separated using smaller boats never returned,\" he said.\nCuaresma said this is why local fishers were already on edge when China's largest Coast Guard vessel started roaming the waters off Zambales earlier this month.\n\"The survivor who made it home couldn't explain what happened to their companions. Some worry they might have encountered Chinese vessels, though we cannot confirm this,\" he added.\nNon-flashpoint area\nAfter two years of increasing run-ins between both nations' Coast Guard vessels, the deployment of China's 12,000-ton vessel off Zambales has brought Beijing's maricreated_at muscle closer to an area that has not traditionally been a flashpoint between the two countries.\nAs a result, Manila has branded China's maricreated_at presence near Zambales - and its reported deployment of a navy helicopter - as escalatory actions that violate both Philippine and international law.\nChina's increasing incursions into the Philippines' EEZ are part of its broader actions in the South China Sea, where it claims historic rights to almost all waters through its \"nine-dash line.\" An international tribunal invalidated this claim in 2016.\nIn recent years, Chinese vessels have maintained a persistent presence around features inside the Philippines' EEZ, from the resource-rich Scarborough Shoal to the submerged Ayungin Shoal where Filipino troops maintain a World War II-era ship as an outpost.\n"

    "text": "\n The 47th president of the United States, Donald Trump, took his oath of office in Washington on Jan. 20. A peaceful transfer of power in America officially marked the stunning political comeback of Trump, unlike the chaotic departure he had in 2021.\nBut on this side of the Pacific, there are many worries that are troubling everyone: What are the prospects for the Philippines, which is the US' oldest and most trusted ally in Southeast Asia, and Filipinos living and working in the US, in the next four years?\nThis two-fold question involves political (diplomatic), security (defense), and economic cooperation (including trade, labor, and people-to-people exchanges), which comprise the three legs of an overarching objective that has nuanced our bilateral relations with our former colonizer since 1946.\nAnxiety over Trump's isolationist approach to international relations and his unpredictable behavior when it comes to overhauling domestic policies, such as immigration, trade, and the environment, is not unfounded. Other nations, including the Philippines, have every right to worry about how he will shake things up.\nThere are fears that Trump, who sings the praises of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, would prioritize American interests over protecting the territorial integrity of nations such as the Philippines when it comes to the contested South China Sea (SCS), which includes the West Philippine Sea (WPS).\nMajor strategic partner\nAttentive observers would notice that during his call with Xi last Friday, Trump was ecstatic: 'President Xi and I will do everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe!' Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\nBut there are positive signals that the 'ironclad' alliance between Manila and Washington would hold under the Trump administration. With the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, the Philippines has cemented its status as a major strategic partner of the US outside of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nLast week, Trump's pick to head the State Department, Marco Rubio, called on China to 'stop messing around' with the Philippines and Taiwan. Chinese belligerent actions in the WPS 'are forcing us to take counteractions because we have commitments to the Philippines and we have commitments to Taiwan that we intend to keep,' Rubio said.\nRubio was not short on details, clearly referencing the hostile presence of the 'monster ship' (China Coast Guard 5901) in waters off Zambales province which, Rubio said, the 'Philippines feels threatened by it, rightfully so.' Rubio rebuked China's bullheadedness, declaring that the US would 'defend the Philippines as its treaty ally' in the event of an attack.\nRotational presence\nSuch an unequivocal pronouncement from the US dispels fears of Chinese expansion remaining unchecked in the SCS. However, the Philippines must continue to insist through diplomatic channels that the US honor, both in word and deed, its security alliance with the Philippines which has stood the test of created_at.\nBesides the Balikatan and maricreated_at exercises, the Philippines has agreed to add four more sites under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (Edca) to the existing five. This is a strategic move that greatly benefits the US interest.\nIn the absence of the US bases' treaty that was rescinded in 1991, Edca legalizes the rotational presence of US troops on Philippine soil, giving the US a solid ground for defending both the Philippines and Taiwan. Edca's immediate impact is in ensuring the freedom of navigation in the SCS, which is at the heart of the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific, besides obvious benefits to global shipping and trade. These Edca sites augur well for stability and security in the region because Edca fills the yawning gap in the US' line of defense against China, which runs from East Asia to Southeast Asia to India.\nUndocumented immigrants\nSecurity begets development, if not prosperity. As the Philippines' largest export market and one of its largest foreign investors, the US' role in stabilizing the Philippine economy is crucial amid its rising national debt, hunger, and self-rated poverty, and persistent unemployment. A stable economy also benefits almost 400,000 US citizens living in the Philippines.\nFinally, Trump's mass deportation plans have placed the fate of millions of undocumented immigrants in limbo, including approximately 250,000-300,000 Filipinos who are illegally staying in the US. Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez wisely advised them to avoid deportation by either leaving the US voluntarily or immediately consulting with immigration lawyers.\nBut we should continue to make representations to US authorities for a fair and orderly process. Providing refuge to around 200 Afghan refugees, who stayed in Manila for less than two weeks this January while the US processed their special immigrant visa applications, is an argument we can raise for a demanding reciprocal gesture from the US in treating our kababayan humanely and fairly.\n"

    "text": "\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Tuesday with his counterparts from Australia, India and Japan as the Trump administration kicked off its formal foreign policy engagements in discussions with the Indo- Pacific “Quad.” The ministers reaffirmed their countries' commitment to the format and its goals and indicated their leaders would meet in the coming months.\nThe grouping of the four countries has been seen by many as an initiative to counter or at least slow China’s increasing assertiveness and aggressiveness in the region, something over which President Donald Trump and his predecessors, including former President Joe Biden, have all expressed deep concern.\nThe timing of Tuesday’s meeting — on Trump's first full day in office and just hours after Rubio was sworn in as America’s top diplomat — suggests it will remain a priority for Trump. And, in a joint statement released after the meeting, the ministers suggested a new Quad summit would be held this year in India, continuing an upgrade of the relationship from foreign ministers to leaders initiated by the Biden administration.\n“Our four nations maintain our conviction that international law, economic opportunity, peace, stability, and security in all domains including the maricreated_at domain underpin the development and prosperity of the peoples of the Indo-Pacific,” they said.\n“We also strongly oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion,” they said in a not-so-subtle reference to China.\nThe two-paragraph joint statement was the only indication of how the meeting unfolded as none of the ministers — Rubio, Australian Penny Wong, Indian S. Jaishankar or Japanese Iwaya Takeshi — spoke as they opened their meeting at the State Department.\nInstead they stood silent and expressionless in front of their respective flags before journalists were ushered out. And, none of them spoke at photo opportunities before individual meetings that Rubio hosted afterward.\nThe Quad was established in 2007 to bring together countries that had worked together in response to the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Its members stress its diplomatic nature and broad focus on regional issues, including infrastructure, humanitarian aid, disaster relief, climate change and maricreated_at security.\nEven though security is only part of the mix, the Quad is a major component of the American strategy to counter China’s growing assertiveness and vast territorial claims in the region, including to virtually all of the strategically important South China Sea and the democratic self-governing island of Taiwan.\nThe strategic element to the Quad has prompted China to accuse the four countries of attempting to form an “Asian NATO,” though it is a very different construction and has no mutual-defense pact, a key component to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance.\nDuring his created_at in the Senate, Rubio was a “China hawk” and he has been sanctioned by the Chinese government for outspoken remarks about the country's human rights record,\nLast week in his confirmation hearing, Rubio called China “the most potent, dangerous and near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.\"\nEarlier Tuesday, Rubio made his first appearance at the State Department as secretary of state and called on U.S. diplomats to forcefully defend and execute Trump’s “America First” policies.\n“The voters decide the course of our nation, both domestically and abroad, and they have elected Donald J. Trump as our president when it comes to foreign policy on a very clear mission,” Rubio told them.\n“And that mission is to ensure that our foreign policy is centered on one thing, and that is the advancement of our national interest, which (was) clearly defined through his campaign as anything that makes us stronger or safer or more prosperous. And that will be our mission, that will be our job.”\nTrump has been publicly skeptical of the value of the State Department since his first term in office and, as he has done with other agencies, accused some in the diplomatic corps of working to blunt or derail his policy priorities.\nRubio paid tribute to the men and women of the State Department, calling them “the greatest, the most effective, the most talented, the most experienced diplomatic corps in the history of the world.”\nBut, his arrival came amid a wave of resignations — demanded by Trump’s team — of career diplomats from senior positions in the State Department bureaucracy and U.S. embassies around the world.\nThe full extent of the resignations sought by the incoming administration remained unclear on Tuesday but began in earnest on Friday when a large number of career diplomats holding politically appointed posts, such as undersecretaries and assistant secretaries of state, were told to resign. On Monday, the demand for resignations grew to include career diplomats serving as ambassadors as well as lower-ranking staffers.\n"

    "text": "\n The northern region of Vietnam is expected to experience cold weather and drizzle during the Tet (Lunar New Year) holiday, according to the National Centre for Hydrometeorological Forecasting (NCHMF).\nDeputy Director of the NCHMF Hoang Phuc Lam stated that in the period leading up to Tet, from January 17 to 25, northern Vietnam will experience light morning fog, dry and sunny days, and continued cold temperatures. In central Vietnam, from Thanh Hoa to Hue, the weather will be mostly cloudy with little to no rain and cold temperatures.\nThe region from Da Nang to Binh Thuan will see cold weather at night and in the morning, while daycreated_at temperatures will be mild and sunny. In the Central Highlands and southern Vietnam, the nights and early mornings will be cloudy, with light fog or mist, but the days will be dry and warm without extreme heat.\nDuring the main Tet period from January 27 to 31, northern Vietnam will be affected by a northeast monsoon, resulting in cold weather, with severe cold in mountainous areas. The northeastern region may see some days with light rain or drizzle.\nIn the northern central region, the strong northeast monsoon during Tet will also bring cold temperatures with occasional light rain. In the central and southern central regions, scattered rain and showers are expected in the days leading up to Tet.\nOver Tet, the eastern coastal areas of southern Vietnam will experience tidal surges from January 30 to February 2. The highest tide levels during this period could reach 4.1 metres, potentially causing flooding in some coastal and estuary areas.\nWeather patterns for 2025\nIn 2025, the ENSO phenomenon is predicted to return to a neutral state with a probability of 55-65% over the three-month period from March to May. It is expected to remain in a neutral state for the rest of the year.\nThis means that while a La Niña event may persist briefly in early 2025, it may not last long enough to be classified as a full La Niña cycle. It is expected to gradually transition back to neutral conditions.\nBased on these forecasts, Lam highlighted several key weather and climate trends for 2025:\nUnder La Niña conditions, winds in the Pacific Ocean will strengthen, reducing convective activity near the central Pacific while increasing it over the western Pacific. As a result, Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and southern Vietnam, may experience above-average rainfall in the early months of 2025. This could lead to unseasonal rains in southern Vietnam during the dry season.\nRegarding tropical depression activity, the number of storms in the East Sea (known internationally as South China Sea) is expected to be similar to the multi-year average, with storm formation beginning around June. The number of tropical storms and depressions affecting the East Sea and Vietnam's mainland is also expected to be in line with historical averages, with about 11 to 13 storms forming in the region and approximately five or six making landfall.\nHeatwaves in 2025 are also expected to be on par with historical averages. Hot weather will likely begin in the southern and Central Highlands regions around early March, in the northwestern region and western parts of central Vietnam around April, and in northeastern Vietnam and coastal central regions from May onwards. However, the intensity and duration of heatwaves in 2025 are not expected to be as severe as in 2024.\nMeanwhile, cold air activity in 2025 is expected to be in line with historical averages, meaning that severe cold spells could occur between January and March. Strong cold snaps could lead to widespread severe cold conditions, frost and freezing rain in northern mountainous areas.\nIn addition, in 2025, the number of large-scale heavy rain events across the country is expected to be similar to the long-term average, with approximately 20 such events. These heavy rain episodes will likely begin in the northern region around June and gradually shift southward, ending in the central region around December, Lam emphasised.\nDuring the early dry season of 2025, saltwater intrusion in the Mekong Delta is expected to be higher than the historical average from February to April. This may impact livelihoods and agriculture in affected areas, but it is not expected to be as severe as in the dry seasons of 2015-2016 and 2019-2020.\nFrom March to July 2025, drought and water shortages could affect some areas in the provinces of Phu Yen to Binh Thuan, as well as Kon Tum, Gia Lai and Dak Lak.\nWith the increasing intensity of strong storms due to climate change, the NCHMF will integrate storm monitoring and warning systems into digital platforms, providing information to the public and government agencies. Artificial intelligence (AI) will be applied in forecasting and early warning systems, initially focusing on storm tracking, heavy rainfall prediction and other rare weather events.\nThe use of AI will enhance the centre's ability to analyse large datasets from various sources (observations, radar, satellites and numerical models) and improve short-term severe weather forecasting, including storm warnings three to six hours in advance. This will help enhance the accuracy of flood and landslide early warning systems.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-21",
    "text": "\nThe arrival of Donald Trump to the presidency of the United States has heightened tensions in the bilateral relationship with China, an issue that has been at the center of his political discourse. Although Trump's stance on economic competition with Beijing is categorical, his approach to security issues-particularly regarding the defense of Taiwan and support for strategic allies such as the Philippines and South Korea-remains diffuse. In contrast, Beijing is making rapid progress in modernizing its armed forces, despite persistent corruption scandals. Aiming to overcome the White House's power projection in the East and South China Seas, the Chinese military is restructuring and, at the same created_at, expanding and modernizing its nuclear arsenal. This strategic maneuver not only seeks to consolidate its regional influence, it poses challenges to US hegemony in the Asia-Pacific.\nXi Jinping faces the second Trump administration from a substantially transformed position of power compared to his first term. After more than a decade at the pinnacle of leadership, he projects himself as an established and experienced statesman. In this context, the boundaries delineated by Xi are unmistakable. During his recent APEC summit meeting with President Joe Biden, the Chinese leader emphasized the \"four red lines\" that the United States must not transgress: Taiwan, democracy and human rights, China's political system and Beijing's right to sovereign development. This statement manifests its uncompromising stance and serves as a blunt warning to the new administration, suggesting that any violation of these principles could aggravate the tensions inherent in the complex relationship.\nAll in all, China's claim to Taiwan constitutes one of the most intricate foreign policy dilemmas Trump will face. During his campaign, he hinted that Taipei should bear costs for its defense against Chinese aggression, raising uncertainty about his steadfastness in protecting the island. However, his recent cabinet and advisory appointments suggest a different approach. These include individuals considered hawks on Chinese policy, such as Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Michael Waltz. Prior to his appointment to the State Department, Rubio expressed that Trump would \"maintain support for Taiwan.\" Although the leader has not specified whether he will deploy military forces to safeguard \"the rebel island\" against a possible invasion, he has expressed his intention to react to such an eventuality with tariffs ranging from 150% to 200% on Chinese products.\nIn this complex scenario, the global economic and security orders face severe tensions, and Trump's penchant for trade wars, his skepticism of alliances, and the likely imposition of tariffs at levels not seen since the 1930s will intensify the role of international trade as a geopolitical battleground, with the potential to destabilize an already fragile system.\nIndeed, China faces the challenge of managing a slowing economy while strengthening its ties with the Western bloc, without sacrificing its relations with other nations. Xi is currently grappling with a series of interconnected crises that threaten the power's stability. The world's second largest economy faces growing investor skepticism, a worsening real estate crisis, an alarming increase in local government debt, a volatile stock market, deflationary pressures and rising social unrest. All in all, improved relations with Washington could be a crucial factor in restoring confidence. For this to happen, however, Xi will need to identify areas of convergence with Trump, a considerable challenge. Leaders in New Delhi, Tokyo and Taipei are on high alert for the possibility of the Republican escalating the trade war with Beijing, as well as the strategic reactions that could be deployed as a result.\nMoreover, the Indo-Pacific confronts a growing security vacuum that raises questions about the reliability of U.S. commitments. Washington's close allies and partners-Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan-are surrounded by uncertainty about the extent to which they can trust the US to honor its security obligations.\nThe unpredictable and transactional nature of Trump's diplomacy exacerbates concerns about potential flashpoints in already tense regions such as the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan Strait. This framework not only aggravates power dynamics in the region, it also forces allies to reconsider their security strategies and bilateral relations in an environment characterized by volatility and ambiguity.\nMoreover, the new U.S. executive will now find itself facing a scenario of growing concern at several points of tension. In North Korea, Kim Jong Un is acting more belligerently, strengthened by a renewed alliance with Russia. Taiwan faces the largest Chinese military exercises in decades, raising uncertainty about US commitment to its defense, given that Trump may see the island as a tool in broader negotiations with Beijing. On the other hand, the Philippines, under the leadership of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, has strengthened its alignment with the US and seeks to deepen military cooperation with regional allies. However, it also faces significant domestic challenges, which could influence the stability of its foreign policy. The mid-term elections in May will be crucial in assessing popular support for its geopolitical orientation and the residual influence of the Duterte dynasty in domestic politics.\n"

We looked forward to the development of the report on complementarities between the ASEAN Community Vision 2045 and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which will help guide us in advancing our green agenda, as we strive towards a more sustainable and resilient future, set out in the ACV 2045.\n10.  We reiterated our commitment to preserve the Southeast Asian region as a nuclear weapon-free zone and free of all other weapons of mass destruction as enshrined in the SEANWFZ Treaty and the ASEAN Charter. We noted that the Executive Committee of the SEANWFZ Commission is continuing to explore the possibility of allowing individual Nuclear Weapon States (NWS) which are willing to sign and ratify the Protocol to the SEANWFZ Treaty without reservations and provide prior formal assurance of this commitment in writing to go ahead with the signing. We welcome any NWS that are ready to do so. We reaffirmed our commitment to continuously engage all the NWS, including those with reservations, and intensify efforts of all parties to resolve all outstanding issues in accordance with the objectives and principles of the SEANWFZ Treaty.\n11.  We welcomed the progress of the negotiations on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC), including the completion of the third reading of the Single Draft COC Negotiating Text (SDNT), and emphasised the importance of maintaining positive momentum in this regard, towards the early conclusion of an effective and substantive COC that is in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS.\n12.  We reaffirmed our collective resolve to combat transnational crime, including people smuggling, trafficking in persons, drug trafficking, cybercrime, money laundering, and the growing threat of online scams. We welcomed the inaugural meeting of the ASEAN Senior Officials' Meeting on Transnational Crime (SOMTC) Working Group on People Smuggling and the proposal to establish the Working Group on Money Laundering as significant mechanisms to enhance regional capacity and coordination, contributing to strengthening regional security.\n13.  We stressed the importance of intensifying regional cooperation to effectively address cyber threats, as ASEAN continues to advance in its digital transformation. We welcomed the establishment of the ASEAN Regional Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) located in Singapore with Malaysia as first regional coordinator. We reaffirmed our commitment to advancing CERT-related information sharing and capacity building that will enable ASEAN Member States to quickly exchange information and where appropriate, work together to address common threats.\n14.  We reaffirmed the roles of the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM) and ADMM-Plus in promoting strategic dialogue and enhancing practical cooperation including through the seven ADMM-Plus Experts' Working Groups. We welcomed the progress in enhancing civil-military coordination for the management of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) efforts. We commended efforts to advance discussions on the proposed application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the defence sector and supported the strengthening of cooperation among ASEAN Member States in the defence industry.\n15.  We looked forward to the convening of the Dialogue among ASEAN National Security Advisors as a forum to address issues of strategic concern and to contribute to strengthening the resilience and institutional capacity of ASEAN and ASEAN-led mechanisms as well as in shaping the region's inclusive and comprehensive security architecture.\n16.  We encouraged regional cooperation in international commercial arbitration and mediation. These efforts aim to foster a robust arbitration and mediation landscape in accordance with established international standards to drive economic growth in the region.\n17.  We reaffirmed our commitment to the ASEAN economic agenda, particularly on enhancing the region's competitiveness and resilience in a created_at of digital transformation and in the face of an increasingly complex and unpredictable global environment. We are encouraged by ASEAN's on-going efforts toward developing a comprehensive, high-quality, and forward-looking ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) and looked forward to its conclusion by 2025. We underscored the need to leverage our collective strengths and harness digitalisation to foster deeper economic integration, and promote sustainable and inclusive growth to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of the region and our peoples.\n18.  We expressed full support for Malaysia's priorities to navigate the region's economic agenda. We looked forward to the implementation of the Priority Economic Deliverables (PEDs), anchored by four (4) Strategic Thrusts namely (i) Enhancing Trade and Investment; (ii) Creating an Inclusive and Sustainable Pathway; (iii) Promoting Integration and Connectivity of Economies; and (iv) Building a Digitally Resilient ASEAN that reflects a holistic and forward-looking approach to advancing ASEAN's economic objectives while addressing key regional challenges and opportunities.\n19.  We underscored the importance of elevating culture and heritage value creation, targeted towards harnessing the rich cultural diversity and heritage assets of Member States to contribute towards enhanced economic growth, cultural resilience and sustainable development.\n20.  We acknowledged the need to advance regional efforts in addressing environmental challenges, including biodiversity loss, climate change, natural disasters, sustainable use and management of water resources, among others, towards promoting sustainable development and achieving carbon neutrality through stewardship, partnership, and ownership. We looked forward to the early operationalisation of the ASEAN Centre for Climate Change.\n21.  We reaffirmed our commitment to realise the ASEAN Power Grid (APG) by 2045, and encouraged efforts to accelerate the establishment of the APG to promote regional energy connectivity, security, and resilience.\n22.  We reaffirmed our commitment to advancing green jobs and skills to drive sustainable and inclusive development across ASEAN.\n23.  We reaffirmed our resolve to strengthen regional capacities for the prevention, preparedness, and response to public health emergencies for a healthy, resilient and prosperous ASEAN.\n24.  We reiterated the commitment to further promote equitable, inclusive and sustainable development across the ASEAN Community by aligning sub-regional growth with the comprehensive development of ASEAN.\n25.  We emphasised the importance of enhanced ASEAN-wide collaboration, focusing on innovation and engagement to advance youth development and sports excellence.\n26.  We looked forward to Timor-Leste being a full member of ASEAN, and recognised the progress made by Timor-Leste in implementing the Roadmap for Timor-Leste's Full Membership, as well as welcomed the enhanced participation of Timor-Leste in ASEAN Meetings following the adoption of the revised Guidelines for the Implementation of the Observer Status Granted to Timor-Leste. We reiterated our commitment, and called on our external partners to continue providing capacity building assistance to Timor-Leste. We looked forward to the establishment of the Timor-Leste Unit in the ASEAN Secretariat, to intensify efforts in facilitating Timor-Leste's accession to ASEAN.\n27.  We are convinced that ASEAN can play a greater role in fostering a stable and predictable environment through adherence to principles of international law, mutual respect, and the peaceful resolution of disputes, including full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, without resorting to the threat or use of force, in accordance with the universally recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS. We also underscored the importance of the full and effective implementation of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) in its entirety. We reaffirmed our steadfast commitment to an ASEAN-centred, open, inclusive, transparent, resilient, and rules-based regional architecture that upholds international law, in light of evolving regional and international challenges.\n28.  We noted the UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/79/144 emphasising in the Preamble, the universal and unified character of the 1982 UNCLOS, and reaffirmed that the Convention sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out and is of strategic importance as the basis for national, regional and global action and cooperation in the marine sector, and that its integrity needs to be maintained.\n29.  We reaffirmed the importance of the TAC as the key code of conduct in governing inter-state relations in the region and as a foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability. We called on all High Contracting Parties to fulfil their obligations under the Treaty. We welcomed the growing interest of non-regional countries to accede to the TAC, on the basis of respect for and in conformity with the purposes and principles of the TAC. We are committed to strengthening relations with ASEAN's current partners and engaging those who have acceded to the TAC. We also looked forward to substantive preparations of the 50th anniversary of the TAC next year.\n30.  We underscored the value and relevance of the AOIP in promoting regional peace, security, stability, and prosperity in light of geopolitical tensions affecting the region, including in building mutual trust and confidence as well as reinforcing an open, transparent, resilient, inclusive, and rules-based regional architecture with ASEAN at the centre that upholds international law. We noted the establishment of the ASEAN Indo-Pacific Business Network (AIPBN) and the intention to convene the ASEAN Indo-Pacific Forum this year.\n31.  We reaffirmed our commitment to promote the implementation of concrete AOIP projects and activities, under the four priority areas in our engagement with external partners, through the various ASEAN-led mechanisms. We underscored the importance of advancing an AOIP that builds mutual trust and confidence as well as reinforce an open, transparent, resilient, inclusive, and rules-based regional architecture with ASEAN at the centre that upholds international law.\n32.  We reaffirmed the importance of strengthening ASEAN unity and Centrality, and our strong commitment to shaping and leading the evolving regional architecture through existing ASEAN-led mechanisms. We agreed to conduct our engagement with external partners based on shared interest, constructive engagement, and mutual benefit, underpinned by ASEAN Centrality, which would contribute to the implementation of the ASEAN Community Vision 2045. We looked forward to the adoption of the 7 Plans of Action between ASEAN and the relevant Dialogue Partners for the new period beginning in 2026.\n33.  We looked forward to the ASEAN-New Zealand Commemorative Summit in Malaysia later this year in conjunction with the 50th Anniversary of the ASEAN-New Zealand Dialogue Relations.\n34.  We looked forward to the convening of the 2nd ASEAN-GCC Summit in 2025 in Kuala Lumpur, and agreed to further advance the effective implementation of the ASEAN-GCC Framework of Cooperation (2024-2028). We also looked forward to the convening of an ASEAN-GCC+China Summit to enhance and deepen economic collaboration.\n35.  We agreed to deepen cooperation under the ASEAN Plus Three (APT) cooperation framework to promote peace, stability, and prosperity in the East Asian region. We welcomed substantive progress in the implementation of the APT Cooperation Work Plan (2023-2027).\n36.  We reaffirmed our commitment to further strengthening the EAS as a premier Leaders-led forum for dialogue and cooperation on broad strategic, political, and economic issues of common interest and concern with the aim of promoting peace, stability, and economic prosperity in the region, with ASEAN as the driving force. We underscored the importance of the East Asia Summit (EAS) and supported the Chair's proposal to develop and finalise a Declaration on the 20th Anniversary of the EAS, an EAS Joint Statement, and thematic statement(s) to further enhance the implementation of the EAS Plan of Action (2024-2028) as outcome documents of the East Asia Summit.\n37.  We agreed to revitalise the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in a holistic and comprehensive manner to maintain its effectiveness, relevance and function as the leading regional security forum in the Asia-Pacific region, enabling it to address current and emerging political and security challenges through a more substantive, constructive and interactive dialogue while also pursuing preventive diplomacy. We also discussed the ways forward on the Hanoi Plan of Action II (2020-2025) which is set to expire this year.\n38.  We also exchanged views on regional and international developments, reaffirming our shared commitments to promoting sustainable peace, security, stability, and prosperity within ASEAN and beyond.\n39.  We expressed our deep concern over the escalation of conflicts and humanitarian situation in Myanmar and the minimal progress on the implementation of the Five-Point Consensus (5PC). We reaffirmed our united position that the 5PC remains our main reference to address the political crisis in Myanmar and further reaffirmed the corresponding Leaders' decisions. The Leaders upheld the decision limiting Myanmar's participation at the ASEAN Summits and Foreign Ministers' Meetings to the non-political level and reiterated that ASEAN community building and decision-making should not be affected. We denounced the continued acts of violence against civilians and public facilities and urged all parties involved to take concrete action to immediately halt indiscriminate violence, exercise utmost restraint, ensure the protection and safety of all civilians and civilian infrastructures, and create a conducive environment for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and inclusive national dialogue. We welcomed the progress of the provision of ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance to Myanmar by the AHA Centre to implement Point 4 of the ASEAN Leaders' 5PC.\n40.  We welcomed the appointment of H.E. Tan Sri Othman Hashim as the Special Envoy of the ASEAN Chair on Myanmar for 2025. We expressed our full support to the Special Envoy in carrying out his mandate in facilitating efforts towards finding an inclusive, durable and peaceful resolution in Myanmar through promoting concrete progress on the implementation of the 5PC.\n41.  We reaffirmed the importance of maintaining and promoting peace, security, stability, safety and freedom of navigation in and overflight above the South China Sea. We further reaffirmed the need to enhance mutual trust and confidence, exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability, avoid actions that may further complicate the situation, and pursue peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with the universally recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS. Concerns were expressed by some Ministers on the land reclamations, recent actions and ongoing developments in the area which have eroded trust and confidence, increased tensions, and may undermine peace, security, and stability in the region.\n42.  We expressed grave concern over the surge in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) intercontinental ballistic missile testing and ballistic missile launches and the increased tension in the Korean Peninsula, which are a worrisome development that threatens peace, and stability in the region. We urged the DPRK to take action to de-escalate tension and called on all concerned parties to resume peaceful dialogue, including to create a conducive environment towards the realisation of lasting peace and stability in a denuclearised Korean Peninsula. We re-emphasised the importance of full compliance with all relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions and to abide by international law. We stressed the importance of continued peaceful dialogue among all parties concerned in order to realise lasting peace and stability in a denuclearised Korean Peninsula.\n43.  With regard to Ukraine, as for all nations, we continued to reaffirm our respect for sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity. We reiterated our call for compliance with the UN Charter and international law. We underlined the importance of an immediate cessation of hostilities and the serious engagement in a genuine dialogue for the peaceful resolution of the conflict. We supported the efforts of the UN Secretary-General in the search for a peaceful solution. We also called for the facilitation of rapid, safe, and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance for those in need in Ukraine, and for the protection of civilians, humanitarian personnel, and persons in vulnerable situations.\n44.  We expressed grave concern over the continued war in Gaza and the Middle East and the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, which has been exacerbated following the 7 October attacks. We condemned all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, which have resulted in immense number of casualties, particularly innocent women and children, the restricted access to food, water, and other basic needs, leading to the further deterioration of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We welcomed the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and urged that the implementation of this agreement to be carried out immediately and comprehensively. We called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, especially ASEAN nationals, women, children, the sick and the elderly. We underscored the importance of release from any arbitrary detention. We urged all parties concerned to work towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict with a view to realising the two-State solution in accordance with international law and the relevant UNSC and UNGA resolutions, including UNGA resolution A/RES/ES-10/23 on the Admission of New Members to the UN dated 10 May 2024 which we all voted in favour. We emphasised the importance of intensifying humanitarian assistance to those in need, including through the restoration of UNRWA's role, and for post-conflict reconstruction in Gaza.\n"

    "title": "Commentary: With Trump back in office, the world can no longer free-ride on American goodwill",
    "created_at": "2025-01-21",
    "text": "\nSINGAPORE: With Donald Trump officially sworn in as America's 47th president, pundits are predicting American foreign policy will become more unpredictable and messy.\nIt's no surprise that Trump's inaugural speech was directed at the American people - particularly his supporters - and not the international community. Words like \"exceptionalism\" and \"manifest destiny\" painted a picture of American might and the ability to wield it against threats at home and abroad.\nHowever, there exists a broad consensus within the United States that a US-led world order has been good for the world, because Washington has seen its interests as synonymous with global ones. Those who espouse this belief may interpret attempts to challenge US dominance not as a threat to America per se, but a threat to the world.\nFour observations follow from this. \"AMERICA FIRST\" POLICY\nFirst, the overall climate of US-China relations will not change. Both countries have viewed one another with great suspicion and hostility for some created_at and this is not likely to change, regardless of what their respective leaders do.\nSince China's reopening to the world in 2023 following the pandemic, I have not come across a single Chinese scholar who is optimistic about the future of US-China relations. China under Xi cannot be seen as weak notwithstanding its economic problems, while America's desire for primacy makes it anxious about countries who do not accept US hegemony as inherently good.\nSecond, it is likely that the second Trump administration will take a more instrumental approach to foreign policy. This means extracting maximum concessions from those who want to build good relations with America and wielding a stick to those who challenge Washington's interests.\nAfter all, Trump was elected by the American people, not by the world. We should not expect the US to pay any price to help anyone, anywhere. Countries who want to get in the good books of Trump would have to demonstrate in a real and tangible manner why America should care about them.\nDoes Trump care about democracy and other values that Biden talk about? Only to the extent that America benefits from its so-called democratic friends. Is being non-democratic a problem? Not if you chose to acquiesce by American interests and conform to its preferences. Vietnam is an example in Southeast Asia of how this can work out. Third, middle powers such as Australia, Japan and South Korea will likely emerge to play more important roles in international affairs, if they are not derailed by domestic challenges. Countries that want to thrive amid geopolitical turbulence need to make decisive contributions at the right moment.\nFinally, a quick word of caution on perceived American decline. Whatever we may think about Trump's policies in the next four years, Trump is effectively in his second and last term. US presidents are effectively constrained by the Constitution, and no single institution (executive, judiciary and legislative) is able to arrogate maximum power to itself.\nAmerican institutions and ideals are defined in a manner that will outlast whatever crazy ideas or narrow interests a single leader may have.\nNO MORE FREE-RIDING ON AMERICAN GOODWILL\nAs a result of Trump's transactional politics, America will likely demand greater contribution from many countries in defence and security matters. This is not necessarily a bad thing because it gives these countries, particularly smaller ones, the opportunity to show that they are not simply doing things at the behest of the United States.\nFor instance, if the Philippines and Vietnam decide to increase their defence budgets to strengthen their territorial claims in the South China Sea, it is not because the US is asking them to, but because they do not want to free-ride on America's security presence in the region. There is a substantial reservoir of goodwill towards the US in Southeast Asia. In the 2024 State of the Region survey conducted by the ISEAS - Yusof-Ishak Institute, respondents were asked which country the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should choose - the US or China - if it were forced to align itself with one.\nFor the first created_at, a majority picked China over the US. However, the margin was paper thin - 50.5 per cent for China to 49.5 per cent for the US, likely due to a swing in Malaysia and Indonesia over American support for Israel in the Gaza war.\nThat said, the 2024 survey showed that 42.4 per cent of those surveyed were confident or very confident that the US would do the right thing to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity and governance. The figure for China was only 24.8 per cent.\nSeen this way, one can observe that when Southeast Asian countries criticise the US, it is because of a perceived American absence, not because of American presence. In fact, more than 70 per cent of respondents expressed the view that cooperation between ASEAN and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), which the US is part of, as being beneficial to the region or complementary with ASEAN's efforts.\nCountries all over the world would need to diversify their partners to ensure that they retain political agency beyond the remit of great power plays. Small countries in particular need to be nimble and deft to find space to act.\nWhile the next four years may be unpredictable to some extent, countries in Asia are much more sanguine about their fortunes only because they have had the experience of Trump's first administration to take reference from. America putting itself first is hardly surprising, don't all countries do so?\nBenjamin Ho is an assistant professor at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, specialising in Chinese international relations and comparative political order.

    "text": "\n Almost 143 kilometers from the coast of Zambales, China's 'monster ship' got so close to the Philippine land mass that the government had to make its stand clearer: 'We do not waver or cower in the face of intimidation.'\nJonathan Malaya, assistant director general of the National Security Council, said 'we do not and will not dignify these scare tactics by backing down' as he stressed how China has been 'pushing the Philippines to the wall.'\nThe 12,000-ton China Coast Guard (CCG) 5901, which is 165 meters in length, is China's monster ship and the world's largest that was seen off Capones Island on Jan. 4 and replaced by CCG 3103.\nHowever, as the Philippine Coast Guard's (PCG) BRP Teresa Magbanua 'gradually pushed it away,' the 'monster ship' came back on Jan. 11 'to outmaneuver' the PCG vessel, which is only 97 meters in length.\nCCG 5901's presence inside the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Philippines prompted the government to point out that it is now 'contemplating things it was not contemplating before.'\n'All options are on the table,' said Malaya, who stressed that the proximity of CCG 5901 is escalating tension between the Philippines and China over areas of the South China Sea.\nRenato de Castro, a professor of international studies at the De La Salle University, said the Philippines has to protest the presence of the monster ship in the West Philippine Sea.\nBut while it won't be enough to stop China, he told INQUIRER.net that filing a diplomatic protest would express the Philippines' strong opposition against China's intimidation.\n'It is not enough but really necessary,' he said. 'It is an indication that we do not accept the situation, which we could not control, but nevertheless, we do not want the situation.'\nThe government, since the start of the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in July 2022, has already filed close to 200 diplomatic protests against China's aggression inside the EEZ of the Philippines.\nIntimidating PH\nExecutive Secretary Lucas Bersamin pointed out that the presence of China's monster ship could be a case of power projection, saying that Malacañang 'view[s] it with concern.'\nIn 2023, CCG 5901 was also seen off the coast of the state of Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo, close to the Kasawari Gas Development Project, based on a satellite image and AIS data from the Asia Maricreated_at Transparency Initiative.\nThis drew a response from the Royal Malaysian Navy.\nDe Castro had told radio station dzBB that China is really making it appear that they can conduct 'intrusive patrols' and that the Philippines is helpless even if CCG vessels are already inside the country's EEZ.\nSeaLight's Gaute Friis, a defense innovation scholar at Stanford University's Gordian Knot Center, said intrusive patrol would describe the presence of CCG vessels 'within the EEZs of other states.'\n'These patrols are a key component of China's strategy to reinforce its expansive maricreated_at claims in disputed waters [as it] aims to establish a continuous presence and gradually normalize its maricreated_at activities in these areas,' he said.\nLast year, CCG 5901 was also seen close to Ayungin, or Second Thomas Shoal, where the Philippines has grounded its warship BRP Sierra Madre to serve as an outpost in the West Philippine Sea.\nBacking PH protests\nNow, as diplomatic protests won't be enough to really stop China's aggression, De Castro said 'we have to rely on our alliance[s],' considering the insufficient naval capabilities of the Philippines.\nBased on data from the World Directory of Modern Military Warships, the Philippine Navy has a TvR of only 33.7 in the 2025 Global Naval Powers Ranking, which takes into account values related to the overall fighting strength of naval services in the world.\nThe TvR, or 'TrueValueRating,' considers modernization, logistical support, attack and defense capabilities to assess strength not only based on the number of warships and submarines but rather on the 'quality and general mix of the inventory.'\nChina's People Liberation Army Navy has a TvR of 319.8, while the United States Navy, which is still considered as the world's most powerful, was given a TvR of 323.9, although China has over 400 warships, compared to the 243 that the United States has.\nLast year, however, Philippine Navy spokesperson Rear Admiral Roy Vincent Trinidad said 'with what is happening right now, not only in the maricreated_at domain but also in the air space, we are good with what we have.'\nHe said even with the present capabilities of the Philippine Air Force, Philippine Navy, and the Philippine Army, 'we are good with what we have, and given more, they can perform even better.'\n'Hard' executive decision\nBut engaging in the use of force is a 'hard executive decision' that Marcos will have to make if the aggression of China would persist and intensify in the West Philippine Sea.\nThis, as De Castro pointed out that the possible use of force would bring the Philippines to the 'realm of uncertainty'-will China be deterred or the Philippines will simply be caught in the middle?\n'It will also depend on whether it is in the interest of our allies to really back us,' he said, stressing that once the United States or Japan assist the Philippines, China would really react.\nHe explained that 'China cannot afford to lose force if it is confronted by the United States and Japan, and once we do it, once we put them in a situation where they would confront each other then we lose control of the situation.'\n'Either we would be caught in the middle or our allies would simply abandon us. So it is an executive decision. The President has to take a calculated risk,' De Castro said, although stressing that the United States is expected to 'act more decisively.'\nHe said: 'So that is why you have to interpret or look at the Mutual Defense Treaty not in terms of its legalistic provision, but in terms of the political context when you have to make that decision.'\n"

    "title": "Is Trump supplying ammo to expansionist China via Panama Canal?",
    "created_at": "2025-01-21",
    "text": "\nAs Donald Trump took the oath of office as the 47th President of the United States, his inaugural speech had a distinct mention of China. Despite reports of phone calls and behind-the-scenes discussions between Trump's administration and Beijing, the President made it clear that China was squarely in his crosshairs. The Panama Canal, which Trump claimed was under \"Chinese control\", became a tool for his claim on the 82-kilometre-long waterway. Trump said the\nUS had \"foolishly\" given the Panama Canal\nto Panama. However, Trump's use of the Panama Canal as a tool to counter China could embolden Beijing's expansionist ambitions in its neighbourhood and beyond. Trump might have unwittingly gone against decades of American policy of teaching restraint to China and given a kind of legitimacy to its expansionist stance. Trump's claim over the Panama Canal could give Beijing, which's growingly becoming impatient and militarily assertive with Taiwan and\nthe South China Sea littoral nations\n, an opportunity and legitimacy to assert its expansionist claims. Commentators and experts argue that Trump's threats to\nseize the Panama Canal, even by force\n, have weakened the credibility of the US's long-standing call for restraint on Taiwan. HOW IS US DIFFERENT FROM RUSSIA AND CHINA, ASK EXPERTS Trump's bid to claim the Panama Canal, which he floated weeks before his Monday inauguration, had already raised eyebrows among experts, prompting them to question how it would differ from the actions of China and Russia. \"Russia's Putin invaded Ukraine saying it's rightfully his. China threatens violence to annex Taiwan. Trump doesn't rule out the use of force to grab Panama and Greenland. Why are they different?,\" wrote New York City-based journalist Geraldo Rivera on X, earlier this month. Yes, Trump even said he would not hesitate to use force in reclaiming the Panama Canal that he alleged was controlled by the Chinese and alleged that Latin American nation Panama had violated \"the purpose of our deal and the spirit\" of the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties. Under the treaties, the US ceded control of the canal to Panama by 1999. These treaties guaranteed the canal's neutrality and allowed US intervention to defend it if necessary. Trump had earlier accused Panama of \"overcharging US ships\" to use the waterway. Trump also called the treaties 'follies' that undermined US influence in the region. The concern flagged by New York City-based journalist Rivera, that Trump's expansionist claims on a sovereign territory on the back of military power, was echoed by another Washington DC-based journalist. DOES TRUMP REMARKS OFFER CHINA AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE FORCE?    CNN anchor Jim Sciutto highlighted the potential consequences of Trump's actions and rhetoric regarding Greenland and Panama. \"The message to China and Russia from Trump's sanctions and military threats to Greenland and Panama is that if the US can use force and intrigue to take another nation's sovereign territory, they can do the same for Taiwan and Ukraine, and they might read a new American willingness to accept those claims,\" wrote Jim Sciutto on X. For years, the US had called on China to exercise \"restraint\" in asserting its claim over Taiwan and to abandon military threats aimed at bringing the democratically governed island under its control. Chinese commentators warn Trump's unconventional tactics may weaken US credibility, empower and \"create an opening for China\", according to a Reuters report earlier this month. \"If Greenland is annexed by the United States, China must take Taiwan,\" Wang Jiangyu, a Hong Kong-based professor was quoted as posting on Weibo. Apart from claiming the Panama Canal, Trump has also laid claim to\nCanada and the Danish-ruled island of Greenland\n in the North Atlantic, in the run-up to his inauguration. Zhao Minghao, a professor at the Institute of International Studies at the Fudan University in Shanghai, said Trump's threats to take the Panama Canal needed to be taken seriously, noted the report. \"Besides that, we need to think about Trump's transnationalism, which he is serious about as well. Many in China still perceive Trump as a deal-maker, even on very tough issues like the Taiwan question,\" Minghao was quoted as saying by Reuters. Currently, around 70% of the ships passing through the canal are involved in American trade. DOES CHINA REALLY CONTROL THE PANAMA CANAL? The US constructed the Panama Canal between 1904 and 1914 to shorten the distances covered by ships travelling between the Pacific and the Atlantic. The waterway seamlessly connected the eastern coasts of the Americas and Europe to Asia. It was in 1999 that the Canal's control was transferred to Panama under the 1977 treaties. The treaty enabled both nations to defend the Panama Canal as a neutral waterway and gave the US to protect its security. It is this security that Trump has made the basis of his claim on the canal, claiming Chinese presence and involvement. Trump's claims have been\nvehemently denied by the Panamanian government\n. China does not control or operate the canal, but a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings has long managed ports at the canal's Caribbean and Pacific entrances, according to an Associated Press report. However, it is also a fact that Panama became the first Latin American country to join China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2017 and Beijing has a growing presence in the region. China's involvement in Panama began in 2016 when Beijing's state-owned company COSCO sent its first vessel through the expanded canal. In the same year, China's Landbridge Group acquired Panama's largest Atlantic port on Margarita Island for USD 900 million, according to a Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post report. In 2018, two Chinese companies won a $1.42 billion contract to build a fourth bridge across the canal that cuts through Panama, according to a Reuters report. Not just Trump, even his Secretary of State Marco Rubio proposed purchasing the Panama Canal earlier this month. Rubio held that the argument that enabled the canal to be handed over was \"violated\". \"While technically sovereignty over the canal has not been turned over to a foreign power, in reality, a foreign power possesses it through their companies... If [China] orders a company to shut it down or impede our transit, they will have to do so,\" Rubio was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post in January. Therefore, Trump's Panama Canal claim might aim to counter China, but it risks Beijing mimicking the very expansionism the US has long condemned. In trying to secure influence, he may have handed Beijing a stronger case for its own expansionist territorial ambitions.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nIs Trump supplying ammo to expansionist China via Panama Canal?\n"

    "text": "\nWe live in an increasingly dangerous and threatening world. There are more flashpoints in today's global geopolitics than we have seen in decades, presenting a generational challenge to the incoming administration of Donald Trump and all of America's elected leadership. \n  At the Panetta Institute for Public Policy, I tell students that in our democracy, we govern either by leadership or by crisis. If leadership is there and willing to take the risks associated with responsibility, we can avoid, or certainly contain, crisis. But if leadership is absent, we will inevitably govern by crisis. The same is true when it comes to foreign policy.\n  As President-elect Trump is about to be inaugurated for his second term, a fundamental question being asked around the world is whether he will repeat the unpredictable and chaotic approach to foreign policy that defined his first term or embrace the idea that he stressed repeatedly during his campaign of ''peace through strength.''\n  President-elect Trump cannot adopt that foreign policy concept, which holds that a strong military can prevent conflict, without also embracing the definition that President Ronald Reagan so eloquently gave it in his speech marking the 40th anniversary of the Normandy invasion. ''We in America have learned bitter lessons from two world wars,'' said Mr. Reagan, who made the idea famous. ''It is better to be here ready to protect the peace than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost.'' He also made clear that ''the strength of America's allies is vital to the United States.''\n  The world that awaits Mr. Trump is far different from and more threatening than what he had to confront in his first four years. Autocrats that once operated in their own spheres of influence have now joined together in an axis of mutual support and aggression: Vladimir Putin of Russia is not just a temperamental bully but also a tyrant who invaded the sovereign democracy of Ukraine and continues to threaten democracies in the West; Xi Jinping of China has made clear that he is prepared for a potential Taiwan invasion and wants to compete with the United States as a leading military power; Kim Jong-un of North Korea is not just threatening democracy in South Korea but has also sent drones and thousands of troops to Russia to fight Ukrainians; Iran, weakened by Israel, continues to enrich uranium and is ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon; and ISIS has once again raised its ugly head by inspiring a lone-wolf attack in New Orleans.\n  Mr. Trump has always prided himself on being a dealmaker, pledging in his campaign that he would resolve such conflicts in the first few days of his presidency. But precisely because it is a more dangerous world, that's unlikely to happen. And if he tries and fails, the United States will appear weak. There is concern that Mr. Trump may have already started off badly by threatening Greenland, the Panama Canal Zone and Canada. Those are the kind of careless and disruptive comments that only undermine American credibility when it comes to dealing with real-world crises.\n  This is, however, a created_at when ''peace through strength'' could actually work. It will require strong, serious and stable leadership to turn the current multipolar crisis into an opportunity for America. The incoming president can be a dealmaker, but it must be from a position of strength. And strength begins with the United States remaining the strongest military power on the face of the earth.\n  To ensure that, the new administration must be willing to increase military investments in recruitment, training, readiness, nuclear weapons systems, the U.S. defense industrial base and research and technology. To accomplish all of this, the defense budget cannot rely on the unpredictability of continuing resolutions. There must be a five-year budget that makes clear our defense priorities and achieves savings in duplication, procurement and bureaucracy.\n  On Ukraine, it is becoming clear that Ukraine and Mr. Putin must find a way to a negotiated settlement to the war. Mr. Trump must make clear that the United States will continue to work with NATO to support Ukraine and that Mr. Putin will not be allowed to succeed. If that message is clear to Mr. Putin and if Ukraine can gain traction against Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky will have the leverage to negotiate a settlement that provides for Ukraine's sovereignty and security, allows Russia to remain in Crimea and other limited areas and achieves an end to the war. That would be peace through strength.\n  Mr. Trump should tell China that it will help Taiwan defend itself, that the South China Sea will remain open pursuant to international law and that the United States will support a strong alliance of Japan, South Korea, Australia, India and other Asian countries to protect the freedom of the seas and commerce in the Pacific. From a position of greater military strength, the United States would have leverage for a more productive dialogue with China on trade, cybersecurity, fentanyl, satellites and other economic issues. To simply expand tariffs on China and start a trade war will result in an economic backlash among unhappy consumers in the United States. Retribution is not dealmaking.\n  Iran is yet another opportunity. Tehran has been weakened by Israel both militarily and economically; it could very well be open to negotiations on limiting nuclear enrichment and stopping support for proxies in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Since the previous Trump administration was critical to the establishment of the Abraham Accords, Mr. Trump could work with Israel to bring Saudi Arabia into the deal, along with other moderate Arab nations. Building a Middle East alliance would be important to dealing with Iran and terrorism, and establishing an approach to peace in the Middle East.\n  The president, as commander in chief, has the power and responsibility to determine America's future security. If he is careless with that awesome power, the United States could very well find itself in another world war. But if the president understands his power, as Mr. Reagan did, he can provide strong leadership and build alliances that steer the world out of war. The key to peace is strength, and the key to strength is leadership.\n  Leon E. Panetta served as secretary of defense and director of the C.I.A. in the Obama administration.

    "created_at": "2025-01-21",
    "text": "\nIn an operating environment with a geopolitical challenge disrupting your supply chain every few weeks, if not days, you need to be prepared for the worst. Plus, there are hush-hush whispers of an impending war that will change how supply chains work and connect. Therefore, plans must be implemented to mitigate risks of over-dependence on adversarial nations, prepare for sudden disruptions, and contribute to preventing conflicts by building sustainable and resilient supply chains. This story will explore how businesses must pivot their supply chain/logistics strategies to ensure resilience while operating in a warcreated_at economy. It will examine the intersection of geopolitics and economic dependencies.\nJust a few weeks have passed since NATO's Admiral Rob Bauer made a call to action for businesses. To mitigate the risk of coercion from nations like China and Russia, Bauer advised companies to adapt their production and distribution strategies to align with potential warcreated_at scenarios.\nAdmiral Rob Bauer's call to action for businesses is created_atly given the increasing geopolitical tensions, particularly between Western powers and nations like China and Russia, and the recent global disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain breakdowns.\nThe rising geopolitical friction between NATO members and nations like China and Russia has created an environment of uncertainty. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China's growing influence, especially in Asia and Africa, have put businesses on edge about potential coercion or disruption of their operations. Both nations have demonstrated a willingness to use economic leverage or military force to achieve political and strategic objectives.\nFor businesses that are integrated into these regions, such pressures can be devastating. Therefore, anticipating and mitigating these risks, as suggested by Bauer, could safeguard not only the physical supply chain but also intellectual property, financial assets, and market access.\nBauer's advice emphasizes the importance of preparing for a possible warcreated_at scenario where critical goods and services may be disrupted. Companies might need to reassess their supply chain strategies to be less reliant on a single country or region that could be subject to political or military pressure.\nLearning from Recent History\nThe Ukraine-Russia war\nIt has been two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, and Putin's 'special military operation' in Ukraine crippled the supply chain operations emerging from, going through and ending in both countries. Initially, it was literally a 'two step forward, one step back' situation. Many hundred tonnes of grains were burnt to ashes and an equal amount were stuck at the ports. Cargo ships and planes were destroyed, and the global crude oil supply was heavily interrupted. Not to forget, both nations being major exporters of raw materials, the war has also prolonged the global semiconductor shortage.\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has led to sanctions on Russia, disrupted energy markets, and resulted in significant shifts in global supply chains. Similarly, China's actions in the South China Sea and its handling of Taiwan and Hong Kong present risks to businesses operating in or dependent on these regions.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of global supply chains, especially for industries reliant on specific regions for raw materials, production, or distribution. The disruptions caused by the pandemic, including factory closures, shipping delays, and shortages of goods, demonstrated how businesses could be crippled by external shocks. With the ongoing geopolitical instability, the risk of future disruptions from either nation-state interference or military conflict remains high.\nBuilding Redundancy and Agility in Supply Chains\nOne of the main lessons from the pandemic is the importance of redundancy. Companies that relied on a single supplier or region for key inputs were hit hardest. Companies with the ability to swiftly pivot, adjust production schedules, and find alternative routes or suppliers were more successful in maintaining business continuity.\nThe lessons from Russia's invasion of Ukraine are similar to those of the pandemic: businesses must develop strategies for redundancy and resilience. For instance, companies involved in industries dependent on raw materials from regions affected by conflict should seek to diversify their sources and avoid putting all their eggs in one basket. Additionally, the war revealed the need for businesses to better anticipate and respond to geopolitical risks. Having contingency plans in place can provide a buffer against unforeseen events like military conflicts or sanctions.\nBusiness Decisions and Geopolitics\nGeopolitics are directly proportional to the business decisions and trade relations. In today's world, no one is entirely independent within their country.\nBusiness decisions and trade relations have increasingly become central to geopolitics, as countries and corporations navigate an interconnected world where economic choices influence international power dynamics.\nA prime example of this is the global reliance on critical resources such as rare earth metals and chemicals, many of which are concentrated in specific regions like China. This reliance not only shapes business strategies but also has farreaching geopolitical consequences, as nations balance economic interests, national security, and political influence.\nOn other hand, geopolitical relations shape trade policies such as tariffs, trade agreements, and sanctions. These policies impact business strategies, determining where companies can trade, what products they can export/import, and the cost of doing business. Sanctions imposed due to geopolitical conflicts can restrict business operations, requiring companies to reassess their strategies and find alternative markets or suppliers.\nIf cheap Chinese imports are banned in the west, then businesses will have to procure the same from some other neutral country or at a high cost from within the bloc. For instance, the US has imposed new tariffs on cheap Chinese EVs, and as a counter, the Chinese have put a ban on Tesla near government buildings as they fear security breaches.\nAs a result of geopolitical conflicts, businesses will have to search for alternative markets to sell their products. New markets like India and EU are likely to be flooded with cheap Chinese EVs which may again lead to another set of trade conflicts with these countries.\nTrade relations built around essential goods often act as a bridge for diplomatic cooperation or, conversely, a source of tension.\nWhile geopolitical unrest creates a number of difficult situations for supply chain managers, Nikhil Puri, Vice President - Direct Purchases, Yokohama Off-Highway Tyres shares that not all outcome is negative. He says, \"Due to the war, India shifted their Crude imports to Russia and the burden on ex-chequer got reduced significantly. One adverse or favourable decision taken by a country will have ripple effect on the supply chains of many industries across different geographies.\"\n\"Some of the impacts of the war-created_at situation are only superficial. The East and the West, sanctioning each other, have rerouted the supply chain, while producers and consumers remain the same. For instance, Russian oil is still being bought by the West albeit they are now being refined in India. The US is still procuring Chinese products, however, they are now being rerouted through Mexico. Nearshoring and regionalization are playing key roles in rerouting the supply chain with countries like Vietnam, India and Mexico benefiting from such rerouting,\" adds Pallavi Chaudhuri, Director, Perfetti Van Melle, giving another perspective to the situation.\nPreparing for Warcreated_at Scenario\nWhen asked about what are their opinions on managing supply chain and logistics in the new geopolitical scenario, this is what experts had to say:\n\"Managing supply chains in today's geopolitical climate presents both challenges and opportunities for innovation. Diversifying suppliers across regions helps mitigate risks from geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and natural disasters. Investing in technologies enhances supply chain visibility, allowing for better forecasting and faster responses to disruptions. Robust contingency planning ensures continuity in the face of trade route blockages or material shortages. Strong collaboration with suppliers and logistics partners improves coordination during crises while focusing on sustainability reduces environmental impact and strengthens resilience.\" Kusum Sharma, Head - Digital Supply Chain Transformation and Manufacturing Excellence, PepsiCo\n"
