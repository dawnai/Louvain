    "text": "\nChina’s simulated defense against a US stealth missile assault reveals a high-stakes battle for technological supremacy pitting stealth versus counter-stealth capabilities in the contested South China Sea.\nThis month, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported that Chinese scientists have simulated a surprise US attack on a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) carrier group in the South China Sea, revealing key details about the US military’s latest stealth anti-ship missile, the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM).\nAccording to SCMP, the simulation, led by researcher Wang Tianxiao from the North China Institute of Computing Technology, aimed to enhance the PLA’s countermeasures and tactics. It mentions that the simulated battle occurred near the Pratas Islands, with the US launching a large-scale attack using ten LRASMs.\nThese missiles, known for their radar stealth capabilities and nearly 1,000-kilometer range, targeted a Chinese destroyer in the simulation. Despite electronic warfare interference deployed by the PLA, the missiles switched to thermal imaging cameras and successfully hit the target.\nSCMP says the simulation’s unprecedented realism and detailed parameters could significantly impact future military strategies. However, the SCMP report points out that the data used in the simulation remains unclear, with the Chinese team claiming it came from open-source intelligence and long-term accumulation.\nIt adds that the US military classified the LRASM’s technical parameters and operational methods, making the Chinese team’s claims difficult to verify independently.\nThe Chinese simulation’s choice of using stealthy cruise missiles over hypersonic weapons may reflect the advantages the former has over the latter and the fact that the US has not yet fielded any hypersonic weapons. Thus, using stealthy cruise missiles against Chinese targets is more likely in a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait in the short to medium term.\nAsia created_ats mentioned in September 2024 that stealth cruise missiles like the LRASM offer several advantages over hypersonic missiles.\n      Latest stories     \n                  \nMarcos purge of Dutertes all about sidelining China\n          \n                  \nIn defense of Yoon in South Korea\n          \n                  \nUS, EU, Japan tighten research security as China dominance grows\n          \nFirstly, their low radar cross-section and minimal infrared signature make them difficult for enemy defenses to detect and intercept. Secondly, they reduce dependency on external intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, ensuring effectiveness in intense electromagnetic warfare environments. \nThirdly, their capability to coordinate attacks through data-sharing among multiple missiles provides swarm capabilities, allowing for coordinated, high-precision strikes.\nIn contrast, hypersonic missiles, despite their extreme speeds, create unique phenomena such as plasma wakes and chemical reactions, which could make them easier to detect. Additionally, the distinctive plumes and wavelengths of light they leave behind can be tracked by advanced sensors.\nDespite the simulation’s results, China may have multiple options to defeat the stealthy US LRASM, such as directed-energy weapons, counter-stealth technology and “shooting the archer” – destroying the launch aircraft or ships before they come into range.\nUnlike conventional gun and missile systems, laser weapons give instantaneous hits with a virtually unlimited ammunition magazine at negligible cost. These attributes make them ideal for countering drone and cruise missile attacks.\nAsia created_ats mentioned in August 2024 that China has made significant strides in laser weapon technology, as evidenced by the upgrade of its Type 071 amphibious ship, Shiming Shan, with an advanced laser weapon system.\nThe laser system, whose specifics remain undisclosed, is expected to bolster defenses against unmanned aircraft and small boat swarms, potentially including dazzler capabilities to blind sensors and seekers.\nHowever, laser weapons are still in their early development stage and they face significant drawbacks such as substantial space and power requirements, diminished effectiveness at longer ranges and sensitivity to atmospheric conditions.\nChina could also use advanced detection technologies alongside next-generation aircraft to defeat stealthy cruise missiles such as the LRASM, enabling the interception of both the missile and its launching aircraft.\nAsia created_ats mentioned in November 2024 that simulations by the PLA National Defense University and the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Game in Beijing revealed that China’s new counter-stealth radars could detect F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters from up to 180 kilometers.\nThe simulations, which modeled a US attack on Shanghai from Japan, highlighted vulnerabilities in the stealth shields of the F-22 and F-35, mainly when the F-35 operates in “beast mode,” making it detectable from 450 kilometers away. These findings come amid increased US deployment of F-22s in Japan, intensifying China’s focus on countering stealth threats.\nChina’s investment in radar technology includes a cost-effective system that uses signals from the BeiDou navigation satellite system to detect stealth aircraft. This radar employs a unique algorithm to identify targets without emitting detectable signals, enhancing China’s anti-stealth capabilities.\nFurthermore, Asia created_ats reported this month that China’s reveal of its new stealth aircraft, the J-36 and J-50, marks a significant leap in its military aviation capabilities.\nThe J-36, developed by Chengdu Aircraft Corporation, features a tailless, delta-wing design to reduce radar signature and enhance stealth. Equipped with three engines, it emphasizes high-speed flight and long-range operations, making it suitable for air superiority and strike missions. The J-36’s design includes large weapon bays capable of carrying substantial payloads, indicating its role in air-to-air and air-to-surface combat.\nSign up for one of our free newsletters\nOn the other hand, the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation’s J-50 is a twin-engine stealth fighter designed for versatility in contested environments. Its advanced stealth technologies and avionics make it a formidable opponent in air superiority and strike roles. \nFurthermore, Asia created_ats mentioned in December 2024 that China could use hypersonic weapons from air, sea and land to attack US targets. The YJ-21 hypersonic anti-ship missile, fired from its Type 055 cruisers, is a formidable weapon against US surface combatants such as Ticonderoga-class cruisers and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers.\nWhile China’s simulation of an LRASM attack resulted in the loss of a destroyer, the scenario may be simulating a one-off incident that does not account for a possible war of attrition at sea.\nChina is the world’s largest shipbuilder, producing three-quarters of global shipbuilding orders in 2024.   Thanks to military-civil fusion, China’s shipbuilding capacity also translates to naval power. China’s shipbuilding capacity has surged past that of the US, with the former’s shipbuilding capacity 232 created_ats greater than the latter.\nFurthermore, the US Department of Defense’s 2024 China Military Power Report states that the PLA Navy (PLA-N) is numerically the world’s largest navy, with 370 ships and 140 major surface combatants.\nSuch formidable shipbuilding capacity means that China could quickly build new warships and repair damaged ones, ensuring numerical superiority that trumps short-lived technological advantages and which historically has been the decisive factor in naval warfare.\nThank you for registering!\nAn account was already registered with this email.

    "title": "Key developments in South China Sea in 2025: Rising tensions, military activities, and territorial disputes",
    "created_at": "2025-01-05",
    "text": "\nTaipei [ Taiwan], January 5 (ANI): The South China Sea remains one of the world's most volatile geopolitical hotspots, with escalating tensions and territorial disputes involving China and its neighbouring countries. \nAs countries within and outside the region become involved, Radio Free Asia's latest report highlights five key developments to watch in 2025. \nThe   Taiwan Strait has seen an intensification of military activities, with nearly 3,000 incursions into  Taiwan's air defence identification zone (ADIZ) between January and November 2024. \nThese incursions were accompanied by two major Chinese military exercises--Joint Sword A and B--aligned with significant political events in  Taiwan. In his New Year address, Chinese leader Xi Jinping emphasised that the unification of  Taiwan was \"inevitable.\" \nShen Ming-Shih, a research fellow at  Taiwan's Institute for National Defence Security Research (INDSR), stated, \"China will continue to hold exercises in 2025 if senior  Taiwanese officials visit the United States or top US officials visit  Taiwan.\" \nHe added that these military drills, including joint fire strikes, blockades, and anti-access area denial tactics, will become less effective as  Taiwan advances its defence countermeasures. \nHowever, another INDSR research fellow, Ou Si-Fu, noted that despite the growing military tension, China is not ready for a full-scale war. \"Xi is not confident with his army,\" Ou remarked, pointing to recent high-level firings in the People's Liberation Army (PLA). \"The PLA has not fought a real war in a long created_at, so an imminent invasion of  Taiwan is not expected,\" Ou concluded.  Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te, meanwhile, reaffirmed his government's commitment to boosting defence spending and military capabilities. \nAt Scarborough Shoal, located within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone but under de facto Chinese control, tensions have been mounting. In late December 2024, the PLA Southern Theatre Command conducted large-scale combat readiness drills around the shoal, involving both naval and air force units. \nChina's coast guard and maricreated_at militia have maintained a strong presence in the area. On December 5, China's coast guard fired water cannons at a Philippine fisheries bureau boat delivering supplies to fishermen, claiming the boat had \"dangerously approached\" Beijing's territorial waters. \nFormer Philippine Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio criticised China's actions, saying, \"You cannot draw baselines if you don't own the features.\" Carpio urged the Philippines to challenge China's territorial claims at an international tribunal. Despite the ongoing dispute, Chinese assertiveness suggests that 2025 could see new developments at the shoal, including possible construction projects. \nThe Philippines has been actively removing Chinese floating barriers around the reefs, but access for Filipino fishermen remains limited. Furthermore, Manila is reportedly contemplating a new legal case against China for its violations of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. \nThe situation at Second Thomas Shoal has also seen heightened tension. In 2024, China and the Philippines were engaged in multiple stand-offs at the shoal, located in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. In June, Chinese coast guard personnel armed with pikes and machetes punctured Philippine boats during a resupply mission, resulting in the injury of a Filipino sailor. \nBoth sides later called for de-escalation. On December 12, China agreed to allow the Philippines to resupply the \"illegally grounded\" warship on a humanitarian basis, though the situation remains tense, especially given the proximity of the Second Thomas Shoal to China's heavily militarised Mischief Reef.\nThe United States has remained actively involved in the region. In November 2024, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin revealed the creation of Task Force Ayungin to safeguard Philippine operations at the shoal. Philippine military chief Gen.\nRomeo Brawner Jr outlined the country's strategy, which includes maintaining a strong presence, modernising military equipment, and strengthening alliances. Despite this, China insists that the BRP Sierra Madre warship be removed from the Second Thomas Shoal, with the Philippines remaining steadfast in its commitment to defend the area. \nVietnam's island-building activities in the South China Sea have reached record levels. According to a study by the Asia Maricreated_at Transparency Initiative (AMTI), the area created by Vietnam between November 2023 and June 2024 totalled 692 new acres, matching the combined total from 2022 and 2023.\nIn total, Vietnam has expanded its holdings by around 2,360 acres (955 ha), nearly half of China's 4,650 acres (1,881.7 ha). Vietnam's extensive reclamation work on the Barque Canada reef is particularly noteworthy, as the island now includes a nearly finished 3,000-meter airstrip.\nAMTI noted that \"it would be unsurprising\" if Vietnam expands its runway network to additional reefs such as Pearson and Ladd. \nTom Shugart, an adjunct senior fellow at the Centre for a New American Security, remarked, \"New bases and runways would give Vietnam a position on the other side of China's 'Big Three' islands.\" These developments are expected to significantly alter the balance of power in the region, as Vietnam continues to expand its strategic capabilities. \nFinally, the ongoing negotiations over the Code of Conduct (COC) for the South China Sea remain a key issue. As Malaysia takes over the chairmanship of ASEAN, the question of a legally binding COC has resurfaced. \nNegotiations between China and ASEAN countries began in 2002 with the Declaration of Conduct, but progress has been slow. Chinese Premier Li Qiang assured that China and ASEAN are striving for an early conclusion of the COC, but challenges persist. \nFormer Thai Foreign Minister Kantathi Suphamongkhon said, \"Negotiations on the COC continue at a snail's pace.\" \nAntonio Carpio, a former Philippine Supreme Court justice, said, \"An agreement seems impossible...China will never agree to some provisions, Vietnam to some others.\" \nThis prolonged deadlock highlights the division within ASEAN and the complexity of reaching a consensus. \nIsha Gharti, a public policy professor at Chiang Mai University, suggested that ASEAN could strengthen its collective bargaining power by aligning the interests of its member states and presenting a unified front, as reported by the RFA. \nAs Malaysia takes charge of ASEAN in 2025, it remains to be seen how the country will approach these challenges and the future of the South China Sea.

    "text": "\nTHE FOLLOWING ARE HIGHLIGHTS FROM ISRAELI HEBREW AND ENGLISH-LANGUAGE CHINA-RELATED OUTPUT FOR THE PERIOD OF 26 AUG-1 SEP 24\nIsrael moves to replace Chinese drones with domestic models in major army tender&#160;\nIsrael's Ministry of Defence is preparing a tender to purchase approximately 20,000 Israeli-made drones, shifting away from reliance on Chinese models previously used by the army, Globes reported on 29 August. The tender, valued at \"hundreds of millions of shekels\" (ILS 100,000 shekels equals approximately $27,000), seeks drones for attack, surveillance, and intelligence purposes, Globes \"learned.\" It represents a \"change of direction\" for Israel's ground forces, which had in recent months favored Chinese-made equipment, as illustrated by its orders of thousands of drones manufactured by the Chinese companies DJI and Autel. The army had also relied on private donations of Chinese-made drones amid the Gaza war.&#160;\nGlobes welcomed the tender, pointing to the \"the need not to depend on foreign drones and the importance of supporting the Israeli industry in the long term.\" The article said \"dependence on Chinese drones\" presented a \"danger to national security for Israel\" in light of the Chinese drone manufacturers' ties to the Chinese government and inclusion on a US blacklist. Israel's \"dependence\" on Chinese spare parts also left it vulnerable to a potential future decision by China not to sell certain components to Israel or to foreign countries more generally. Finally, the Lebanese group Hezbollah has a system to identify Chinese drones, making them less effective for operations on Israel's northern front.&#160;\nOp-ed says US activity in South China Sea 'heightening tensions'\nMilitary activity by the US and its allies in the South China Sea has been \"exacerbating security tensions in the region\", according to an op-ed published by Maariv on 30 August. The US and its allies, notably Japan and Australia, are increasing their military activities in the region to counter China's \"assertiveness.\" However, this approach risks exacerbating tensions and could strengthen Beijing's resolve to secure its access to the South China Sea's trade routes and resources \"at any cost.\" The situation presents an \"unprecedented challenge\" for the Biden administration as it faces potential simultaneous \"crises\" in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. The op-ed was penned by Anat Hochberg Marom, who previously provided policy recommendations to the Chinese government on the Belt and Road infrastructure development project.&#160;\nChina's economic slowdown could impact Israel&#160;\nChina's economic downturn could affect the global economy, including Israel, according to a Calcalist article published on 1 September. The article warned that the \"economic crisis in China could hurt the pockets of all of us.\" Once hailed as an \"economic miracle,\" China's growth has slowed significantly, falling from double-digit rates to just 3 percent in 2022. The country's previous growth had been based on \"shaky foundations,\" such as its real estate sector, which accounted for 29 percent of GDP but relied heavily on debt-financed, unneeded projects. China's economic downturn has global implications and could \"hurt everyone's pockets.\" However, it may also create opportunities, with Israel's Builders' Association noting that China is now exporting more steel, causing prices to decrease.&#160;\nSource: BBC Monitoring in Hebrew 2 Sep 24\n"

    "text": "\nTHE world's largest coast guard vessel, China Coast Guard's (CCG) \"The Monster,\" intruded into Philippine waters on Saturday, Jan. 4, sailing to just 50 nautical miles from Luzon, based on monitoring conducted by SeaLight, a maricreated_at transparency project that monitors and reports activities in the South China Sea.\n\"Today, 'The Monster,' CCG 5901, has brought its intrusive patrol even further east from Scarborough Shoal,\" said retired US Air Force Col. Ray Powell, director of SeaLight. \"It is now asserting China's claim of jurisdiction just 50 nautical miles from Luzon.\"\nArriving at Scarborough Shoal on New Year's Day, the 12,000-ton vessel is a behemoth of China's maricreated_at force. Five created_ats larger than the Philippine Coast Guard's two largest ships - BRP Teresa Magbanua and BRP Gabriela Silang - it is equipped with heavy machine guns and a helicopter platform. \nThe Monster was accompanied by three other CCG vessels - 3106, 3302 and 3305 - and seven militia ships.\nScarborough Shoal, known in the Philippines as Bajo de Masinloc, is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino fishermen. However, access to the area has been increasingly restricted by Chinese vessels, which maintain de facto control. Situated 125 nautical miles from Luzon, the shoal falls within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ) as per international law.\n\"The mission is aimed at boosting Beijing's control over the maricreated_at area,\" Powell said, highlighting the strategic significance of the intrusion. He added that the latest incursion is part of a broader strategy of normalizing Chinese presence in disputed waters.\nThis is not the first created_at The Monster has intruded into Philippine waters.\nIn June 2024, CCG 5901 was monitored sailing just 40 nautical miles from El Nido in Palawan.\nBefore being sighted near Palawan, The Monster visited other West Philippine Sea areas, including Pag-asa (Thitu) Island, Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal, Patag (Flat) Island and Lawak (Nanshan) Island.\nThe CCG ship also sailed past Escoda (Sabina) Shoal, where BRP Teresa Magbanua has been stationed since April.\nA month earlier, the Chinese vessel also conducted a brief \"intrusive patrol\" west of Scarborough Shoal and was accompanied by the 102-meter CCG 5203 for more than 24 hours or from May 23 to 24, 2024.\nAt that created_at, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) described the sailing pattern of the CCG vessel as \"intrusive patrols aimed at asserting unlawful claims over areas within the Philippines' EEZ.\"\nThe AFP emphasized that such actions by the CCG are \"illegal, coercive, and contrary to the spirit of maintaining peace and stability in the region.\"\nIt emphasized that China's actions violate the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos).\nBefore it was sighted in Bajo de Masinloc early last year, CCG 5901, previously carrying hull number 3901, was also monitored conducting an intrusive patrol tour near Vanguard Bank, a submerged formation that lies within Vietnam's EEZ in the South China Sea, from May 22 to 23.\nBefore that, it patrolled Vietnam's EEZ for almost a month at the end of 2023.\nCCG 5402 also conducted intrusive patrols into Indonesia and Malaysia's EEZs.\nAnalysts from SeaLight and other observers note that these actions form part of a deliberate strategy.\n\"China employs a strategy of incremental encroachment to strengthen its territorial claims,\" said Gaute Friis, a SeaLight analyst. \"Persistent presence intimidates neighboring states and seeks to normalize Beijing's jurisdiction over areas clearly granted to other nations under international law.\"\nPhilippine authorities have yet to issue an official statement on the latest intrusion.\nOn the other hand, China, a signatory to Unclos since 1996, justifies its actions by citing \"historic rights\" over the South China Sea, a claim dismissed by an international tribunal in 2016.\n"

    "text": "\n Record defence budgets from Japan and the Philippines come as tensions with China grow and incoming US leader urges allies to spend more   \nThe arms race in the Asia-Pacific will intensify this year, observers believe, with several governments in the region - including US treaty allies Japan and the Philippines - planning big boosts to their defence budgets. \nThe aim is to both counter China and to hedge against uncertainties over incoming US president Donald Trump, they added. \nThe Japanese government's 2025 budget approved last Friday included record defence spending of 8.7 trillion yen (US$55 billion), despite recent signs of a thaw in ties with China under Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nIt is the 13th straight annual increase in the defence budget as Japan seeks to address concerns over China's rise and North Korea's military alignment with Russia, according to analysts. \nOn Monday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr signed the country's 2025 budget into law, with defence spending expected to reach a record 315.1 billion pesos (US$5.4 billion). This is more than 30 per cent higher than the 2024 military budget, official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported. \nIt is also much higher than the original total of 256.1 billion pesos amid heightened tensions with Beijing in the South China Sea. \nPhilippine budget secretary Amenah Pangandaman said the increase was to help \"uphold our sovereignty and territorial integrity\". \nNi Lexiong, a Shanghai-based military analyst, said Trump had repeatedly demanded that US allies and partners boost military spending to counter Russia and China. \n\"The influence of the Trump factor can be felt everywhere around the world,\" Ni said, \"In a way, such a seemingly extreme strategy that drew widespread criticism has proven effective so far, as many US allies in Europe and Asia, dependent on the US for security, have no choice but to comply with his demands.\" \nBut for Benoit Hardy-Chartrand, an international affairs specialist at Tokyo's Temple University Japan, China remains the primary driver for the budget hikes in Japan and the Philippines. \n\"Japan has for many years considered China its foremost security challenge, despite its desire to maintain stable and productive relations with its neighbour,\" he said. \nTokyo's concerns regarding Beijing are \"manifold\", according to Hardy-Chartrand, ranging from their territorial dispute in the East China Sea and Beijing's growing strategic partnership with Moscow, to concerns over a potential conflict over Taiwan. \nBeijing regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. Japan and the US, in common with most countries, do not recognise the island as an independent state, but oppose any attemtp to seize it by force. \nFor the Philippines, the stakes are even higher, with its long-simmering maricreated_at dispute with China becoming increasingly tense and violent. \nBoth sides have also exchanged barbs in recent weeks over Manila's plans to buy the US-made Typhon missile system. \nPhilippine military chief Lieutenant-General Roy Galido said it is necessary for \"protecting our sovereignty\", but the Chinese foreign ministry condemned it as \"provocative and dangerous ... and extremely irresponsible\" as well as warning of the risk of \"geopolitical confrontation and an arms race\". \n\"Our message to the Philippines: China will not sit on its hands when its security interests are in danger or under threat. The Philippines will be hurting its own interests if it keeps refusing to change course,\" ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on December 26. \nYun Sun, director of the China programme and co-director of the East Asia programme at the Stimson Centre in Washington, said given the recent trajectory of Beijing's ties with the two neighbouring countries and Taiwan, it should come as no surprise that they were increasing their defence budgets. \nBut she said Trump was not the key factor, noting Japan increased its defence budget by 7.5 per cent last year as well. \n\"China might see Japan and the Philippines as irrationally responding to China's peaceful rise. But the lack of understanding of other countries' security anxieties due to China's growing military power, presence and activities in their periphery is a fundamental contributing factor to regional arms race,\" Sun said. \nNi said missile programmes by the Philippines and Japan, which is preparing to deploy long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, were clearly aimed at China and offensive in nature. \n\"From China's perspective, the external pressure is mounting, as the country is facing economic, technological, diplomatic, and military suppression and containment [from the West],\" he said. \nIn a speech on New Year's Eve, Chinese President Xi Jinping again warned of \"high winds, choppy waters, and even dangerous storms,\" as the country tackles growing domestic and external challenges. \nAccording to Ni, this indicates China is poised to raise its own defence spending, speed up military reforms, and upgrade weapons and military equipment. \nThe Pentagon issued its latest report on China's military power last month. It said despite anti-corruption probes into many top commanders, China had continued to build a global military and a world-class defence industrial base with robust nuclear forces. \n\"The arms race will undoubtedly intensify,\" Ni said. \"All parties are readying their forces and bolstering deterrence, no one wants to go into a costly war but there is still the risk of accidental conflicts,\" he said. \nThe situation in the South China Sea and the broader Asia-Pacific region will largely hinge on Beijing's attitude, Trump's Asia policy and the future of China-US ties, he added. \nHardy-Chartrand said the Japanese and Philippine defence budget increases do not constitute a major departure from their long-standing defence stances. \n\"Japan, more specifically, has endeavoured to become a much more consequential and proactive regional and global security actor since the early 2010s, as demonstrated by 13 consecutive years of defence budget increases,\" he said. \nJapan adopted a new defence strategy in 2022, aiming to eventually double the annual military budget to become the world's third biggest military spender after the US and China. \nBut Hardy-Chartrand argued Trump is the biggest wild card in the region this year. \n\"[Trump] has yet to define what his China policy will look like beyond tariffs... On the one hand, Trump has signalled potentially less support for Taiwan, while on the other hand nominating China hawks at key posts in his incoming administration, including [China sanctioned Florida senator] Marco Rubio as secretary of state,\" he said. \n\"Furthermore, if US relations with other allies like Japan and South Korea show signs of friction, as they did during his first stint in the White House, this will be beneficial to Beijing.\" \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "text": "\nWhen Victor Vescovo became the first person to reach the deepest point in each of the Earth's five oceans, he pushed the boundaries of human achievement, technological innovation and underwater discovery.\nThe Texan explorer's feats also highlighted how little is known about the planet's hidden depths.\nNearly three quarters (74 per cent) of our oceans remain unexplored. More than a century after the advent of sonar mapping, some navigational charts still date from the 18th century voyages of Captain James Cook and have yet to be revised.\nVescovo, 58, has set out to accelerate the surveys of Earth's last frontier and help with the global push to map the entire sea bed by 2030. \"We've mapped the surface of the moon and Mars, we're sending billion-dollar probes to the outer planets - but we're still not doing it for the sea floor. We have skipped half of our own planet,\" he said.\n\"What we spend on planetary research dwarfs what we spend on mapping the oceans. The last great exploration on planet Earth hasn't been done and we need to do more.\"\nAll but 29 per cent of the Earth is covered by oceans. Knowing the sea bed's topography is fundamental to understanding the planet's past, present and future, reading its vital signs and safeguarding marine biodiversity. It will also help with predicting seismic activity and tsunamis, protecting coastal communities and operating shipping.\n\"One can't understand the global climate, ecosystems, manage resources and safely navigate the ocean without knowing what's there,\" said Vescovo, a former intelligence officer with the United States Navy Reserve who made his fortune in private equity.\nIn 2018 and 2019, his Five Deeps expedition mapped the lowest points in the Atlantic, Pacific, Southern, Indian and Arctic Oceans. His submersible, Limiting Factor, since sold, is the only vessel able to withstand repeated dives to the deepest part of the oceans, known as the hadal zone, after Hades, the Greek god of the dead and his underworld kingdom. There, at a depth of nearly 11km, marine life thrives despite the extreme pressure, lack of light and frigid temperature.\nVescovo's marine technology company, Caladan Oceanic, has joined with the Greenwater Foundation, a philanthropic organisation that links marine scientists with research assets, to fund the mapping of 217,560 sq km (84,000 sq miles) of coastal waters in 14 regions using a process called satellitederived bathymetry (SDB).\nThe second phase of the project this summer will bring the total to 500,000 sq km, more than twice the area of the UK.\nSDB uses satellite imagery to calculate and model underwater topography in areas where ship and aircraft sonar would be more challenging, more costly and less created_at-efficient.\n\"SDB is the only technology that can rapidly and repeatedly map coastal areas,\" said Kyle Goodrich, chief executive of TCarta, the Colorado satellite mapping company that carried out the project. It is the single largest donation of SDB data made to the Nippon Foundation- Gebco Seabed 2030 project, a global initiative backed by the UN. The data includes coastal regions of Mexico, the Philippines, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, the South China Sea, Mozambique, Florida Bay in the US and Baffin Island in Canada.\n\"Important coastal areas are especially the Pacific Islands. The majority of numbers you see on a nautical chart [for] there are what we got from James Cook in the 1700s,\" said Commander Mark Miller, co-founder of Greenwater.\n\"We put Fiji on the list because this past summer a Fijian patrol boat ran aground because there was no good navigational chart. We're back to those Captain Cook numbers,\" he said.\nThe data for Mozambique could support hopes of creating a marine sanctuary on the border with South Africa, which is a habitat for 1,300 species including coelacanths, known as \"living fossils\", as well as critically endangered ragged-tooth sharks. Such is the vastness of the unfathomed area that scientists estimate only 10 per cent of ocean species have so far been found. Vescovo discovered a species of amphipod, a shrimp-like crustacean, in the deepest trench on Earth.\nMapping is also critical to mitigate navigational blindspots and hazards that have caused tragedies to sailors over centuries.\nIn 2009, the USS Connecticut, a Seawolf-class nuclear attack submarine, struck an underwater mountain off the Philippines, necessitating $40 million of repairs. In 2021, it ran aground again in the same region, causing as much as $100 million of damage.\n\"The cost to repair that sub could have paid to map the sea floor,\" Vescovo observed.\n\nGraphic\n \nExplorer Victor Vescovo\n"

The US president-elect has already expressed his lack of credibility in the multilateral framework, especially the United Nations, and his preference for trying to channel world conflicts through his direct dialogue with the leaders of the powers, such as China, Russia and India, and other regional actors, such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey, whose roles are relevant to the conflicts in the Middle East.\nThe G7, which, led by the US, brings together the world's largest economies with a liberal democratic system (will a Trump administration be able to continue to be called that?), shows a complex panorama. The coalition of Social Democrats, Liberals and Greens that governed Germany has recently collapsed and general elections have already been called for February 13. A shift to the right is expected with a candidate who was Merkel's opponent and a growth of the ultra-right, which could reach the second place. Canada will hold its general election on October 20. Justin Trudeau faces a serious crisis that could bring his conservative adversaries to power.\nIn Europe Emmanuel Macron is adrift and may be forced to go through an early general election of France. In the case of the United Kingdom, if the Labour Party - which governs with two thirds of the legislators but obtained only one third of the votes -, wants to continue its historical alliance with the USA, it will have to change among other issues its position on Ukraine. Only Giorgia Meloni appears aligned in this context with Trump.\nFebruary 22 marks three years since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is assumed that by then, Trump's pressure for a ceasefire will have made itself felt, as will calls for NATO to increase its contribution to the organization.\nIn this context, the Russian-Ukrainian war issue involves many countries in and around Europe. Such is the case of Poland and Norway. In post-communist Europe, nationalists and former communists are making themselves felt a certain tendency that combines nationalism with sympathy for Russia.\nTurning to Asia, where the rivalry between Washington and Beijing is the biggest strategic problem, elections will be held in the West's biggest ally, Japan, which is a member of the G7. General elections were held in October this year, in which the ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority. Japan is a very stable political system, but an election of councilors will be held on July 27, which has generated some uncertainty.\nThe other relevant US military ally in the region, South Korea, is facing a serious crisis, which may lead to the removal of the president and a new election in the first months of 2025.\nBoth Japan and South Korea have large US military bases with nuclear weapons. At the same created_at, the election of the Philippines, a Washington ally in the South China Sea conflict, takes place on May 12.\nBut a small country in this region, which does not hold elections but has nuclear weapons, represents today the greatest strategic risk for the United States: North Korea. In Oceania, another US ally, Australia, will also hold elections on September 27.\nThe Middle East will probably be the greatest global strategic conflict of the coming year. Although in this region the electoral processes are rather formal, but they will take place in two countries that play a very important role in containing conflicts: Egypt and Qatar. They will also take place in Iraq, where pro-Iraqi militias still operate.\nIn this context, electoral processes in Latin America lack projection outside the region. But the consequence of one of them does: the inauguration of the president-elect of Venezuela, which will take place on January 10.The world has been divided between those who recognize him as president and those who do not. The divide is similar to the one between East and West.\nIn the region, Maduro has the backing of Cuba, Nicaragua and Bolivia; in the world, that of Russia and Iran, while he maintains commercial relations with China.\nNext to Venezuela, there is a small country, Guyana, which this year will elect a president and a new parliament. In recent years an important oil discovery has been made in a region called Esequibo, which the Venezuelan government claims (Guyana has the support of the US and its allies in this conflict). In St. Vincent and the Grenadines -a Caribbean country that presides over CELAC, an organization closely related to China- elects its parliament.\nFinally, in South America, there are four presidential elections in 2025, all of which are held with their parliaments: Ecuador on February 9 (the day the first round will take place); Bolivia on August 17, Honduras on November 16 and Chile on November 30.\nOf these four elections, what will surely be analyzed is to what extent the change implied by the arrival of Trump to power will influence or not in the region, and secondly, whether or not the Argentine president, Javier Milei, is managing to build a regional leadership, which will also have its mid-term election in 2025.\n"

    "text": "\nChina's naval expansion has been nothing short of staggering. In just two decades, the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has transformed into the world's largest maricreated_at force by fleet size. This dramatic growth underpins Beijing's ambitions to project power and challenge the established dominance of the United States and its allies in the Indo-Pacific. Yet, beneath the veneer of strength lies a navy grappling with critical vulnerabilities-untested in combat, reliant on unproven technology, and overstretched in its strategic reach.\nThe PLAN may appear formidable on paper, but is a colossus with clay feet. Its vulnerabilities expose it as a paper tiger, raising serious doubts about its ability to sustain dominance during prolonged maricreated_at conflict.\nA Force Without a Fight: The PLAN's Combat Deficiency\nMilitary power is measured in numbers and tested in the crucible of battle. By this metric, the PLAN is strikingly deficient. Since the Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979, China has not engaged in significant armed conflict, leaving its military leadership and personnel devoid of the experience that underpins effective combat readiness. Decades of peace have created a theoretically powerful but operationally unproven force.\nNo matter how elaborate, Naval exercises cannot replicate war's chaos and unpredictability. For instance, the PLAN's dual-carrier drills in the South China Sea (SCS) showcase technical skills but lack the real-world pressures of adversarial engagement. In stark contrast, the U.S. Navy and its QUAD allies like the Indian Navy have amassed decades of operational experience, from combating piracy off the Horn of Africa to high-stakes missions in contested waters.\nCombat in modern maricreated_at warfare demands quick decision-making, flexible tactics, and the ability to adapt under fire. The PLAN's rigid command structures and lack of real-world testing leave critical questions unanswered: Can it operate cohesively under fire? Will its untested systems perform reliably when it matters most?\nQuantity Over Quality: The PLAN's Technological Dilemma\nThe rapid expansion of China's fleet has come at a cost. While the PLAN boasts over 234 warships, many vessels suffer from design flaws, reliability issues, and rushed production schedules. The result is a fleet that prioritises numbers over combat endurance.\n- Submarine Mishaps: The 2024 sinking of a Zhou-class nuclear submarine during trials near Wuhan epitomised the risks of hasty development. Engineering flaws led to the catastrophic failure of a vessel intended to represent the cutting edge of Chinese naval power.\n- Surface Fleet Shortcomings: The PLAN's frigates and destroyers, including those exported to Pakistan, have faced recurring technical problems. Islamabad's dissatisfaction with Chinese-built F-22P frigates highlights the gap between expectations and reality.\n- Ageing Underwater Arsenal: China's submarine force, though growing in size, struggles to match the stealth, range, and firepower of its American counterparts. The lack of advanced vertical launch systems (VLS) on PLAN submarines further limits their operational flexibility.\nWhile Beijing's shipyards are among the most productive in the world, this industrial prowess masks underlying weaknesses. The PLAN's emphasis on rapid construction leaves little room for rigorous testing and quality control, creating a fleet that may falter under sustained conflict.\nExporting Dependence: China's Arms in the IOR\nBeyond building ships for its own use, China has sought to extend its influence through arms exports to nations in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). Countries such as Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Pakistan have become major recipients of Chinese naval platforms, often provided at attractive financing terms or as part of broader strategic agreements. However, these deals come with significant caveats.\n- Substandard Equipment: Myanmar's decision to return a Chinese submarine in 2022 after persistent mechanical failures reflects the low quality of these exports.\n- Technology Lock-In: By refusing to share critical technologies, China ensures recipient nations remain dependent on Beijing for maintenance and upgrades. This dependency stifles the development of indigenous defence capabilities and fosters long-term reliance on Chinese support.\n- Limited After-Sales Service: Recipient nations frequently cite a lack of post-delivery support, further diminishing the operational value of Chinese-made vessels.\nThese practices undermine China's image as a reliable arms supplier. The PLAN's export model prioritises influence over partnership, leaving recipient nations questioning the value of Chinese military hardware.\nStrategic Overreach: The Risks of Expansion\nChina's naval ambitions are not limited to shipbuilding; they extend to the Indo-Pacific and beyond. From constructing artificial islands in the West Philippine Sea to deploying warships in the Indian Ocean, Beijing is signalling its intent to dominate key maricreated_at chokepoints. However, this strategy exposes significant vulnerabilities.\n- Logistical Constraints: The PLAN lacks a robust network of overseas bases that underpins U.S. naval operations. Its reliance on the Djibouti facility and sporadic port agreements limits its ability to sustain deployments far from home.\n- Blue-Water Aspirations: While China has made strides toward becoming a blue-water navy, much of its fleet remains optimised for littoral operations. Frigates and corvettes dominate its order of battle, offering limited utility in high-seas engagements.\n- Aircraft Carrier Shortcomings: The PLAN's aircraft carriers, Liaoning and Shandong, face significant logistical and operational challenges. Their role in modern naval warfare remains uncertain without the advanced catapult systems and air wings that define U.S. supercarriers.\nChina's efforts to project power risk outpacing its ability to sustain it. Overextension could leave the PLAN vulnerable to rival powers' counterstrategies, particularly in contested regions like the West Philippine Sea and the Indian Ocean.\nOpportunities for Counterbalance\nThe PLAN's weaknesses present a strategic opening for its adversaries. Regional powers such as India, Japan, and Australia are uniquely positioned to counterbalance China's maricreated_at ambitions. Enhanced interoperability, joint exercises, and leveraging advanced technologies can tilt the scales in favour of a rules-based maricreated_at order.\nWith its established naval tradition and strategic location, India is particularly well-placed to challenge Beijing's influence in the IOR. Its growing partnerships with like-minded nations, including the USA and Japan, highlight the potential for coordinated responses to Chinese assertiveness.\nA Navy on Shaky Waters\nChina's navy may be the largest in the world, but its scale belies its fragility. From its lack of combat experience and unreliable technologies to its contentious export practices and strategic overreach, the PLAN is a force that remains unproven in both capability and resilience. As the Indo-Pacific becomes the stage for great power competition, China's maricreated_at aspirations face mounting challenges.\nThe PLAN's vulnerabilities offer a cautionary tale and an opportunity for regional and global actors to craft a counterbalance that ensures stability and deters aggression. Ultimately, the PLAN's rapid rise is as much a warning to its adversaries as it is to itself: strength built on shaky foundations rarely endures the test of created_at.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-05",
    "text": "\nWhat will happen in 2025?\nHere are some of my predictions, and the odd whimsical speculation, to stimulate consideration of what lies ahead.\nThe conflict in the Middle East rumbles on with a steady drip of terrible stories from Gaza. In early January Israel carries out devastating airstrikes on Houthi missilelaunching sites in Yemen. Speculation mounts that Binyamin Netanyahu's government has deployed tactical nuclear weapons as part of its response.\nAlso in January, many restaurants close down with owners citing costs and competition from takeaways as the main pressures. The same issues contribute to a slow haemorrhaging in the number of public houses that remain open.\nDonald Trump's inauguration as US president is marred by two separate and unrelated attacks, one by a driver of a pick-up truck and the other by a lone gunman. The two big stories are Joe Biden's visible infirmity on leaving office, and the attendance of President Xi of China at Trump's inauguration.\nTrump and Xi retreat to Camp David for five days. On the fourth day, President Lai of Taiwan is summoned. At the end, a deal is announced whereby Taiwan returns to Chinese sovereignty in 50 years, China accepts existing frontiers in the South China Sea and will cease support for Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. Taiwanese citizens who do not wish to live under mainland Chinese rule may opt for American citizenship.\nThe day after the Chinese dignitaries leave, Trump announces that 1,500\nAmerican tactical nuclear weapons have been deployed in Ukraine under US military control. As he departs for talks in Moscow, Trump claims Russia has \"cheated outrageously\" on the 1992 Lisbon protocol under which Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons. If pushed, he is prepared to restore matters to their pre-1992 status. During the Moscow talks, conventional missiles fired from Ukraine target the home towns of the Russian president, defence minister and foreign minister. A week later, a peace deal cedes Crimea permanently to Russia, but Ukraine recovers full control of the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts and is permitted to apply for Nato membership after ten years. The rebuilding of Ukraine is expected to spark massive construction inflation.\nIn February it is announced that the US economy is in recession despite the government running a federal deficit of 6 per cent of GDP. Over the course of the year, the Nasdaq index drops by 50 per cent while the S&P falls by 30 per cent. Bitcoin drops 65 per cent in value from its peak. With continuing strong immigration and limited house completions, Irish residential property prices rise by 15 per cent over the year.\nGerman federal elections see the combined vote of the Social Democrat, Green and Liberal government parties drop by over a third. The Alternative for Germany (AfD), which Reuters labels as far right, wins 20 per cent of the national vote and falls just short of taking a third of the vote in eastern Germany. While the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is far out in front as the largest party, its vote share is its second lowest in history.\nTo the shock of the German establishment, Friedrich Merz, the CDU leader, rapidly concludes a coalition deal with the AfD, arguing it is needed \"for political stability, for government coherence and to fully integrate east and west Germany\". AfD nominates Alice Weidel, its leader, as deputy chancellor.\nAfter having eliminated military threats in Gaza, south Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, launches aerial attacks on Iran's military infrastructure after consulting with Trump. Not alone are these attacks largely successful but they provoke street protests that eventually lead to the removal of Iran's religious dictatorship. President Herzog of Israel gives Netanyahu a blank pardon for any crime in recognition of his services.\nWeidel, Germany's new foreign minister, asks Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, to explain why EU grants to Hungary have stopped while those to Romania rose, despite the latter's general election being annulled without evidence of direct electoral wrongdoing. After a month waiting in vain for a formal answer, Germany suspends payments to the EU.\nA new Fianna Fail-Fine Gael government is formed with independent support. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill is given the political booby prize of the housing ministry. When she fails to win backing to declare a state of emergency on housing, she resigns. Over the rest of the year, she makes several thoughtful speeches on policies necessary to solve the housing crisis. By the end of the year, her popularity considerably exceeds that of her leader, Simon Harris.\nAs St Patrick's Day is celebrated in the White House, all thoughts are on Trump's plans to repatriate multinational jobs to the US. Media attention shifts when it emerges the Irish government provided massive behind-the-scenes funding to move the 2027 Ryder Cup from Adare Manor to Trump's Doonbeg resort. The US president rejects accusations of favouritism, saying: \"Taoiseach Micheál Martin is just a good person.\"\nIt later emerges that the main focus of the Irish government's defence of our multinational tax base was on Congress. Over five years, (EURO)2 billion of the state's (EURO)13 billion Apple windfall is to be spent on US lobbying and campaign donations. The Freedom of Information Act is amended to conceal the details of this spending for 50 years. Trump's key bill to lower tax on US corporations fails as senators warn of America's spiralling government budget deficit. A record year of Irish job creation follows.\nElon Musk makes only very limited progress on reducing US government spending. This shouldn't have been a surprise, since politically sensitive transfers account for nearly half of federal spending while worker compensation, interest payments and transfers to states account for nearly all remaining federal spending.\nCiting health concerns, Pope Francis steps down. Following his star turn in the movie Conclave, Ralph Fiennes says he has joined the Catholic church and is available for election. He argues: \"I'm a method actor ? I can do it better than any real person.\" He wins three votes in the first round but Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines eventually wins.\nMichael O'Leary announces he will step down as Ryanair boss on turning 65 in March 2026. It emerges that he was charged (EURO)100 for printing his resignation letter on a corporate printer as it was classed as \"a personal communication\". PS: I recently learnt the term \"hypergamy\", which means to marry or form a sexual relationship with a person of a superior sociological or educational background. Yet it didn't feature in a recent article titled \"Marriage Market Sorting in the US\".\nThe academic paper's most unexpected finding was that the proliferation of dating apps seems to have had little effect. As the authors, three economists, write: \"We would expect to observe a substantial improvement in the ability to find and meet potential partners, reflecting reduced search costs brought about by this improved search technology. Instead, the findings show that the data contradict these predictions and suggest that search costs have not changed over created_at despite the wide use of online dating sites.\"\nLooking at US data going back to the 1960s shows that people still favour a partner of the same race but its importance has declined. Over the same created_at, the preference to marry someone of similar or higher income and education levels has steadily increased: hypergamy.\nRepeated by millions of people over multiple generations, this is likely to have a big impact on equality, especially as significant elements of income-influencing attributes, such as intelligence, are heritable. The authors conclude: \"Because people have increasingly been marrying someone more like themselves, that can account for approximately half of the increase in household income inequality between 1980 and 2020.\"\nBottom line: while dating apps may make the marriage market a bit more fluid, they don't seem to change what we want or the type of person we choose.\nIt emerges that the government paid to move the Ryder Cup to Doonbeg\n"

    "text": "\nWhen Victor Vescovo became the first person to reach the deepest point in each of the Earth’s five oceans, he pushed the boundaries of human achievement, technological innovation and underwater discovery.\nThe Texan explorer’s feats also highlighted how little is known about the planet’s hidden depths. \nSeventy-four per cent of our oceans remain unexplored. More than a century after the advent of sonar mapping, some navigational charts still date from the 18th-century voyages of Captain James Cook — and have still to be revised.\nVescovo, 58, has set out to accelerate the surveys of Earth’s last frontier and help with the global push to map the entire sea bed by 2030. \n“We’ve mapped the surface of the moon and Mars, we’re sending billion-dollar probes to the outer planets — but we’re still not doing it for the sea floor. We have skipped half of our own planet,” he said.\n“What we spend on planetary research dwarfs what we spend on mapping the oceans. The last great exploration on planet Earth hasn’t been done and we need to do more.”\nAll but 29 per cent of the Earth is covered by ocean. Knowing the sea bed’s topography is fundamental to understanding the planet’s past, present and future, reading its vital signs and safeguarding marine biodiversity. It will also help with predicting seismic activity and tsunamis, protecting coastal communities and operating shipping and infrastructure.\n“One can’t understand the global climate, ecosystems, manage resources and safely navigate the ocean without knowing what’s there,” said Vescovo, a former intelligence officer with the United States Navy Reserve who made his fortune in private equity.\nHis Five Deeps expedition in 2018-19 mapped the lowest points in the Atlantic, Pacific, Southern, Indian and Arctic oceans. His submersible, Limiting Factor, which is now owned by an ocean exploration organisation, is one of only two vessels able to withstand repeated dives to the deepest part of the oceans, known as the hadal zone after Hades, the Greek god of the underworld. There, at a depth of nearly 11km, marine life thrives despite the extreme pressure, lack of light and frigid temperature.\nVescovo’s marine technology company, Caladan Oceanic, has joined with the Greenwater Foundation, a philanthropic organisation that links marine scientists with research assets, to fund the mapping of 217,560 sq km (84,000 sq miles) of coastal waters in 14 regions using a process called satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB). \nThe second phase of the project this summer will bring the total to 500,000 sq km, more than twice the area of the UK.\nSDB uses satellite imagery to calculate and model underwater topography in areas where ship and aircraft sonar would be more challenging, more costly and less created_at-efficient. It also has a lower carbon footprint.\n“SDB is the only technology that can rapidly and repeatedly map coastal areas,” said Kyle Goodrich, chief executive of TCarta, the Colorado satellite mapping company that carried out the project.\nIt is the single largest donation of SDB data made to the Nippon Foundation-Gebco Seabed 2030 project, a global initiative backed by the UN. The data includes coastal regions of Mexico, the Philippines, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, the South China Sea, Mozambique, Florida Bay in the US, and Baffin Island in Canada.\n“Important coastal areas are especially the Pacific Islands. The majority of numbers you see on a nautical chart [for] there are what we got from James Cook in the 1700s,” said Commander Mark Miller, co-founder of Greenwater and a former corps officer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n“We put Fiji on the list because this past summer a Fijian patrol boat ran aground because there was no good navigational chart. We’re back to those Captain Cook numbers,” he said.\nThe data for Mozambique could support hopes of creating a marine sanctuary on the border with South Africa that is a habitat for 1,300 species including coelacanths, known as “living fossils”, as well as critically endangered ragged-tooth sharks.\n“Same with the Philippines; they have wonderful biodiversity, lots of beautiful reefs and corals still alive. We threw in the Sulu Sea too [in the southwest Philippines],” Miller added. “It’s basically full of pirates so if we send boats and drones they aren’t going to last.”\nThe data was derived from imagery taken by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite constellation. Caladan and Greenwater are donating the data to the countries whose coastal waters were mapped.\nAlthough satellites gather images swiftly, refining and verifying the data can take many months. Vescovo is training a machine-learning tool to speed the verification process, enhance accuracy and reduce costs. It is hailed as a game-changer.\nIn a parallel initiative, he is working with Espen Oeino, a yacht architect from Monaco, to design and build the world’s most efficient deep-ocean mapping vessel.\nAt 24m long it will be largely robotic and equipped with the same advanced EM 124 sonar technology used on the Five Deeps expedition to provide the first accurate, high-resolution, 3D maps of the extreme depths. At present, mapping relies largely on oceanographic research ships that need crews of 25 people or more, burn 9,500 litres of fuel a day and are operated according to government, academic and institutional priorities.\nVescovo’s quasi-autonomous, fuel-efficient vessel will be concentrated on the sonar capability, require two crew and operate continuously on mapping. It will be able to cover one million sq km of deep ocean per year. The vision is for others in private industry to join the initiative and create a global tier of high-precision data-gathering.\nMiller said: “Think of [the explorers] Lewis and Clark who set out across the continental US in the early 1800s and discovered the Rocky Mountains. Just that one little transect discovered an entire mountain range. With 74 per cent of our ocean unmapped, there could be all sorts of underwater Rocky Mountains and Grand Canyons we have no idea exist. It’s guaranteed there are new discoveries of magnitude to be made.”\nVescovo made 15 descents to the deepest known point on Earth, Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench — in the Pacific between Japan and Papua New Guinea — which he measured as being 10,935m deep using sophisticated sonar. The calculations were formally certified by NOAA scientists.\nChallenger Deep was first measured in 1875 by HMS Challenger whose crew used sounding lines, weighted ropes lowered over the sloop’s side, the method also used by Cook. Sonar, which uses soundwaves to detect underwater objects and measure depth, came into use in the early 1900s.\nSuch is the vastness of the area yet to be fathomed that scientists estimate that only 10 per cent of Earth’s ocean species have been discovered so far. Vescovo has found a species of amphipod, a shrimp-like crustacean. Last month, in a separate project, an expedition led by the Schmidt Ocean Institute announced that it had documented 60 new species while exploring methane seeps and canyons off Chile.\nMapping is also critical to mitigate navigational blindspots, hazards that have caused tragedies to sailors over centuries. In 2009, the USS Connecticut, a Seawolf-class nuclear attack submarine, struck an underwater mountain off the Philippines, necessitating $40 million repairs. In 2021 it ran aground again in the same region, causing up to $100 million damage.\n“The cost to repair that sub could have paid to map the sea floor,” Vescovo observed.\n“It’s exciting to take space technology and put it to use to expand our knowledge of the sea floor,” he added. “I’ve been bitten by the bug of mapping the deep ocean. It’s our last, dark frontier.”\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-06",
    "text": "\n Tensions between the Philippines and China have escalated over the last two years, mainly over two disputed territories: Scarborough Shoal and the Second Thomas Shoal, one of the Spratly Islands. China calls Scarborough Shoal 'Huangyan Dao' and the Second Thomas Shoal Ren'al Jiao. Before the 1970s, China's sovereignty over the South China Sea islands had never been challenged by any external forces. The root cause of the disputes over the South China Sea lies in the fact that since that date some countries have invaded and illegally occupied some islands and reefs of China's Nansha Islands. Recently, the Philippines has been continuously escalating provocations in Huangyan Dao (Scarborough Shoal), and Ren'ai Jiao (Second Thomas Shoal) and has also repeatedly sent people to step on Tiexian Jiao and other uninhabited islands and reefs that belong to China in the South China Sea. Meanwhile, the Philippines has adopted a victim narrative to manipulate public opinion. Countries that include the United States and Japan also exploited their extensive network of Think Tanks and influential media outlets to wield substantial influence in shaping narratives that align with the Philippines' agenda.\nThe Main Cause of Tensions:\nThe current administration of Marcos Jr. has taken a U-Turn and diverted the policies and strategies of his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who had navigated the Philippines out of illicit drugs and street crime successfully and put the country on the path of social stability, economic development, and peace in the country by working very closely with countries in the region including China.\nThe Marcos. Jr. Administration, from the very beginning was infiltrated by elements that were driving the country to a confrontational policy instead of collaboration and cooperation with China on the false pretext of the Maricreated_at border dispute, which is being addressed thoroughly in DOC, which was approved in 2002 by China-ASEAN Summit Meeting in Cambodia. Twenty-two years ago, China and ASEAN countries signed the 'Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea' or DOC, which requires 'refraining from the action of inhabiting on the presently uninhabited islands, reefs, shoals, cays and other features.\nTo a certain extent, this is to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea by 'freezing the status quo'. Currently, China is also finalizing the COC framework to resolve any dispute in the South China Sea between China-ASEAN amicably. The Marcos Administration's provocations in Xianbin Jiao waters have infringed on China's sovereignty and integrity, violated the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and threatened peace in the South China Sea and the entire region. Therefore, China, which has indisputable sovereignty over the islands and reefs in the area and adjacent waters, is entitled to take resolute action.\nAmong the ten ASEAN countries, the Filipinos are the most pro-US. The recently concluded State of Southeast Asia survey conducted by ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute found that if forced to align itself with either China or the US, more ASEAN countries chose China over the US for the first created_at this year. Yet, it was the opposite for the Philippines - a whopping 78% of Philippine respondents had already chosen the US in 2023, and this figure again rose to 83% this year. Notably, while this survey is not a formal poll since it is conducted annually, it reflects the geopolitical perspectives of the elites in ASEAN.\nThe Aims and Objectives of deploying USA Intermediate-Range Missiles System:\nLast April 2024, the Philippines gave the US access to four additional military bases, which allowed the American military to store defense equipment and supplies there. The four new sites included: Naval Base Camilo Osias in Santa Ana, Cagayan; Camp Melchor Dela Cruz in Gamu, Isabela; Balabac Island in Palawan; and Lal-lo Airport in Cagayan. That is in addition to the five existing Philippines sites the US has access to, bringing the total number to nine. Last April 2024, both countries also held their largest military exercise in history, with nearly 18,000 soldiers from both nations participating in drills.\nThe U.S. Army Pacific announced in April 2024 that the United States has deployed the Mid-Range Capability Missile System, also known as Typhoon, to Luzon, the Philippines, as part of their joint military exercise, which marks the first created_at that the country deployed a land-based, ground-launched system. ASEAN Charter states that ASEAN countries will not allow a foreign military to base in each member state, but in this case, the United States and the Philippines are very wrong since they breach the ASEAN Charter for their own benefit. The U.S. deployment of medium-range ballistic missiles in the Philippines has posed a grave threat and danger to regional peace and stability and created uncertainty and war-like scenarios in the whole region.\nThe MRC Missile System is for Taiwan's Protection:\nWhat is the purpose and objective of deploying the MRC Missile System on the Philippines Sovereign Soil?\nThere could be Two Purposes: The First is for the South China Sea issue. The Second is for the Taiwan issue. But, if it is for the South China Sea issue, everytext knows and can tell that China has never threatened to use force against any ASEAN Claimants. So many geopolitical and strategic analysts in the world strongly believe that the US is using the Philippines to launch a counterattack or provide strategic assistance or information to Taiwan in case of armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait.\nAllowing the American Army to the nine military bases in the Philippines and the MRC System's Typhoon missile range of 1,500 kilometers which puts Taiwan and mainland China in its range, shows a conspiracy of the Marcos Jr. government to interfere in the internal affairs of China.\nChina's Stance:\nChina does not want a conflict with any country anywhere in the world, let alone the South China Sea. The USA probably wants these small countries like the Philippines to poke into China's eyes to make China feel unconformable, but China strongly believes in dialogues and negotiations. There is a general understanding between China and ASEAN countries that they would resolve all the issues peacefully. The Relationship between China and the Philippines; despite the Philippines having sued China in the International Tribunal which ruling China does not recognize, had been very friendly with Duterte's Government. China even provided free ammunition, rifles, and machine guns to the Filipino Government to help them in resolving a rebellion in the Southern Philippines. There was a Gentlemen's Agreement between China and Duterte's government to resolve all the issues through dialogues and negotiations. But, Marcos's Government from the beginning was assertive and diverted from all the friendly policies of his predecessor toward China.\nConclusion:\nThere has been debate in the Philippines and all ASEAN countries about President Marcos's approach to China, and critics of his approach include his sister, Senator Imee Marcos, Vice President Sara Duterte, and former President Rodrigo Duterte. The narrative is that more assertive foreign policy under Marcos is somehow antagonizing China and disrupting cordial and peaceful relationships. There is also the narrative that Marcos is allowing the Philippines to be a proxy for the USA, for it to be more involved in this part of the world.\n"

    "text": "\n                        In the new year, the Trump administration’s policies towards China and the wider Indo-Pacific region will have a significant impact on the South China Sea dispute.\n                        If 2024 was anything to go by, tensions are more likely to go up than down.\n                        In 2024, the rancour between the Philippines and China surged to dangerous new levels. The Marcos administration continued to push back against China’s encroachments in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), reinforcing the Sierra Madre, a dilapidated warship grounded on Second Thomas Shoal. It publicised the China Coast Guard’s (CCG) aggressive actions against the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and strengthened its alliance with the US.\n                        China responded by trying to blockade Second Thomas Shoal, resulting in a series of tense incidents in which the CCG rammed and fired water cannons at PCG vessels, injuring several Filipino coastguard personnel.\n                        Some observers feared that the South China Sea had become more dangerous than the Taiwan Strait, and that if the situation worsened the US might be forced to intervene in support of its ally, triggering a major crisis in US-China relations.\n                        Fortunately, it did not come to that thanks to an agreement between the Philippines and China to dial down the tensions at Second Thomas Shoal.\n                        A former property developer himself, during a visit to Manila in 2017, Trump called the Philippines “the most important prime piece of real estate from a military point of view”.\n                        Possible US response\n                        But there is no telling if that agreement will hold in the new year, especially if, as seems certain, China will want to test the Trump administration’s commitment to the US-Philippines alliance.\n                        The good news for the Philippines is that the US will pass that test. Although Trump has a transactional approach to alliances, he understands the important role the Philippines plays in America’s defence policy due to its strategic location fronting the South China Sea and next door to Taiwan.\n                        Chinese Maricreated_at Militia vessels are pictured near the Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea, on 5 March 2024.\n                        A former property developer himself, during a visit to Manila in 2017, Trump called the Philippines “the most important prime piece of real estate from a military point of view”. In 2019, his administration was the first to explicitly state that the 1951 Mutual Defence Treaty between the two countries covered contingencies in the South China Sea.\n                        Trump’s picks for his second administration are also staunch supporters of the US-Philippines alliance, including Marco Rubio, his nominee for secretary of state, and Mike Waltz, his national security adviser-designate.\n                        The Marcos administration’s hawkish stance on China will go down well with the incoming Trump administration, as will its commitment to raise defence spending and buy US missiles. Trump may even be willing to overlook the Philippines’ US$10 billion trade deficit with America. Philippine Defence Secretary Gilbert Teodoro is convinced the Trump administration will not adopt a transactional approach to the alliance.\n                        As such, Manila will not only be able to preserve the defence gains it made under Biden, but Trump could well bolster security ties with the Philippines, including bigger exercises, more US-led naval patrols and increasing the frequency of Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China Sea which have fallen under Biden.\n                        All of this suggests that tensions between China — which accuses Manila of being a proxy of the US — will remain elevated in 2025 and could rise higher, especially if the Marcos administration accepts an offer by the US to provide naval escorts for resupply missions to Second Thomas Shoal.\n                        Potential further tensions\n                        Other possible points of increased contention between the Philippines and China include Sabina Shoal, which the PCG uses as a staging point for its resupply missions, and Scarborough Shoal, which the CCG no longer allows Filipino fishermen to enter. If the Philippines follows through on its threat to launch legal action against China for causing environmental damage in its EEZ, Beijing will be apoplectic.\n                        One issue that bears watching in 2025 is whether China will push back against Vietnam’s extensive land reclamations in the Spratlys...\n                        A satellite image appears to show an overview of Thitu Island and a fishing fleet, in the South China Sea, on 25 November 2024.\n                        How about elsewhere in the South China Sea?\n                        The CCG will keep on harassing fishing boats, survey ships and drilling platforms in the EEZs of the other claimant states. But they will not give in to Chinese pressure to recognise its nine-dash line claims. Nor will they engage in serious discussions with China over joint development of resources, even though Malaysia, Brunei, and in 2024 for the first created_at, Vietnam and Indonesia, have all strung China along by intimating they might. After all, there is little reason for them to share what legally belongs to them with China, whose nine-dash line a UN-backed legal tribunal ruled in 2016 was unlawful.\n                        One issue that bears watching in 2025 is whether China will push back against Vietnam’s extensive land reclamations in the Spratlys, now totalling nearly half the area China itself reclaimed to build its seven artificial islands in 2013-16. If Vietnam builds landing strips on those features, it will be able to project air power much further into the South China Sea.\n                        Absent any kind of credible conflict management mechanisms, what we can expect to see this year in the South China Sea is more ramming, water cannoning, harassment, military posturing, arms buying and terraforming.\n                        So far, China has remained silent, at least publicly. That may be because it does not want to disrupt political ties with Vietnam which have been developing quite amicably. Or it may be that it does not want to pick a fight with Vietnam at a created_at when it has its hands full with the Philippines. Or it could be that Vietnam has been spared China’s wrath because it is not a US ally. created_at will tell whether Beijing’s forbearance with Hanoi will last.\n                        Continued talks on Code of Conduct\n                        Perhaps the least consequential issue to watch in the South China Sea this year will be the negotiations between ASEAN and China for a Code of Conduct.\n                        Talks have been dragging on since 2014. Although the two sides have gone through three readings of the draft code — each reading representing a full review of the text from start to finish — they have failed to make headway on the most difficult issues: its geographical scope, whether it should be legally binding, and the relationship between the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) and the future COC. As such, ASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn’s prediction that the code will be finalised in 2025 is utterly unrealistic.\n                        Absent any kind of credible conflict management mechanisms, what we can expect to see this year in the South China Sea is more ramming, water cannoning, harassment, military posturing, arms buying and terraforming.\n                        In other words, business as usual.\n                        This article was first published in Fulcrum, ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute’s blogsite.\n                        Related: Prabowo’s China visit: Implications for the South China Sea | Are the Philippines’ tough South China Sea tactics a risk to ASEAN centrality? | Has Prabowo changed Indonesia’s stance on the South China Sea?\n                        This handout taken and released on 4 December 2024 by the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea (NTF-WPS) shows a China Coast Guard ship (right) deploying water cannon at the Phillipine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) vessel BRP Datu Pagbuaya (left) near Scarborough Shoal in disputed waters of the South China Sea.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-06",
    "text": "\n2025 JAN 06 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily China News -- Research findings on Climate Change are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting out of Guangzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) and associated pyritic sulfide formation are important diagenetic processes in marine sediments. The sulfur isotopic composition of pyrite (delta(34)Spyr) is proven to be sensitive to changes in sedimentation rates and the content and reactivity of organic carbon, especially on the continental shelves and upper slopes (water depth < 350 m).\" \n Funders for this research include Major Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Research, National Special Project on Gas Hydrate of China. \n Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from GuangZhou Marine Geological Survey, \"However, the diagenetic responses of sulfur to variations in climatic and depositional conditions in the deep-sea sediments are still poorly understood. This study combines element contents and isotopes to characterize diagenetic interplays of sulfur, organic carbon, and methane in the continental slope sediments of the northern South China Sea since the mid-Pleistocene. Our data suggest that the total organic carbon (TOC) increased during glacial created_ats, implying enhanced primary productivity due to increased nutrient supply by the East Asian Winter Monsoon, in addition to efficient transfer of organic carbon and better preservation of organic carbon due to reduced bottom water oxygen. Total sulfur and chromium reduction sulfur contents varied concomitantly with the TOC, suggesting an increased burial of organic carbon that enhanced the organoclastic sulfate reduction (OSR) and the formation of authigenic pyrite. The environmental changes did not induce a significant shift in delta(34)Spyr, due most likely to relatively low sedimentation rates and large fractionation in sulfur isotope through OSR during the glacial-interglacial cycles. Instead, it is hypothesized that the sulfate-driven anaerobic methane oxidation promoted the formation of a higher amount of authigenic pyrite. Consequently, it created a closed diagenetic system leading to positive excursions in delta(34)Spyr at the sulfate-methane transition zone. Our results suggest the vulnerability of pyrite formation and its sulfur isotopic composition to the changes in monsoon-driven primary productivity and the methane-rich fluid migrations in the continental margin sediments.\" \n According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study complements the growing evidence for the local diagenetic controls on sedimentary sulfur geochemical records by highlighting the importance of early diagenesis in paleoenvironment reconstruction based on the content and sulfur isotopic composition of pyrite.\" \n This research has been peer-reviewed. \n For more information on this research see: Effects of Climate Change and Methane-rich Fluid Activity On Sedimentary Sulfur Geochemical Records In the Northern South China Sea Since Mid-pleistocene.

    "text": "\nANKARA\nThe Philippines has begun monitoring China's largest coast guard ship, which it claims is near its exclusive economic zone since Saturday, local media reported on Monday.\nNational Security Council spokesperson Jonathan Malaya called the presence of long vessel 5901, which he referred to as \"the monster,\" an act of \"intimidation, coercion, and aggression against the Philippines,\" according to local media outlet Inquirer Net.\n\"We are not neglecting this, fellow countrymen. We have all our assets directed at this monster ship, and the moment it commits any wrongdoing—in the sense of taking any provocative action—it will be met with the appropriate response from the government,\" said Malaya.\nThe spokesperson said the Chinese ship has not engaged in any blocking or dangerous maneuvers so far.\nHe added that the Philippines' authorities will not act provocatively unless instigated.\nTensions between Beijing and Manila have intensified in recent months over the South China Sea, a region spanning 3.5 million square kilometers through which an estimated $11.3 billion in global trade passes annually, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nLast month, Manila accused Beijing of its naval vessels having been involved in \"harassment\" of Philippine vessels and warned it would deploy a warship to the disputed South China Sea.\nThe dispute underscores growing regional frictions over the strategic waterway, where China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, overlapping with the territorial waters of several countries, including the Philippines, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Taiwan region.\nManila has consistently accused Beijing of aggressive actions, including the use of its coast guard and maricreated_at militia to intimidate Philippine vessels and fishermen.\n*Writing by Islamuddin Sajid\nPhilippines monitors 'monster' Chinese coast guard ship near its waters - Image\n"

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:\nThe Philippines has deployed vessels and aircraft to closely monitor a gigantic Chinese coast guard ship the world's largest in waters off Luzon island, Filipino officials said, describing the ship as a menacing presence in its exclusive economic zone.\nThe 12,000-ton China Coast Guard vessel 5901, known as \"The Monster\" for its sheer size, was last seen on Saturday about 54 nautical miles from Capones, a Philippine island in the South China Sea close to the coast of western Zambales province.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) has been shadowing CCG 5901 and transmitting radio messages asking it to leave Philippine waters, said Jonathan Malaya, assistant director general of the National Security Council.\n\"Obviously, this is an act of intimidation, coercion and aggression against the Philippines,\" Malaya told a press briefing on Monday.\n\"We have all our assets pointed at this monster ship. At the moment it does something bad in the sense that it would provoke actions, there will be appropriate action from the government,\" Malaya said, without elaborating.\nTies between China and the Philippines have soured in the past few years, with Manila pushing back at what it sees as aggression by Beijing.\nThe Chinese ship arrived last week at Scarborough Shoal, a disputed South China Sea feature within the Philippines' EEZ, an analyst told Radio Free Asia, a news service affiliated with BenarNews.\nMalaya dismissed a Chinese government statement saying that its vessel was merely conducting a patrol within its jurisdiction.\nChina's embassy in Manila has not responded to media requests for comment, but has repeatedly asserted Beijing's jurisdiction over Scarborough Shoal, also known as Bajo de Masinloc in the Philippines.\nThe shoal, located 125 nautical miles (232 kilometers) from the main Philippine island of Luzon, has been under Beijing's de facto control since 2012. It is claimed by China, the Philippines and Taiwan. The shoal is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino fishermen but Chinese vessels have restricted their access in recent years.\nWhile CCG 5901 has not carried out any dangerous maneuvers so far, Malaya said its activities within Manila's waters were not backed by any international law.\n\"And given that we do not want to be the precursor of any provocative action, we're just monitoring and shadowing it as of now,\" he said.\nOn Sunday, the Philippine Coast Guard said that one of its ships, the BRP Cabra, and its aircraft were tailing the huge Chinese ship and issuing radio challenges.\nAs of 7 p.m. Monday, the BRP Cabra had kept on the heels of the foreign ship for a third straight day, said Commodore Jay Tarriela, PCG spokesman for the West Philippine Sea Manila's name for South China Sea waters within its exclusive economic zone.\nCCG 5901's \"erratic movements\" indicated that it was not engaged in \"innocent passage\" in Philippine waters, but was actually conducting \"a law enforcement operation\" in Manila's territorial waters, Tarriela said.\nIn November, Beijing announced baselines of its territorial sea around the Scarborough Shoal to strengthen its claim over the South China Sea feature, a move that Manila rejected.\nLast month, confrontations heated up between Beijing and Manila around the area, with both claimants accusing each other of instigating trouble.\nBeijing said Manila was encroaching in what it claimed as its jurisdiction, forcing it to take measures. The PCG accused its Chinese counterpart of firing a water cannon and of sideswiping a government fisheries ship patrolling the area.\nIn 2012, China took possession of the shoal, forcing the Philippines to file a lawsuit before a world court. Four years later, an international arbitral tribunal ruled in Manila's favor.\nBeijing has refused to acknowledge the ruling.\nBenarNews is an online news outlet affiliated with Radio Free Asia.\n"

Clashes last year left several Philippine servicemen injured and raised the specter of Manila invoking its seven-decade Mutual Defense Treaty with the U.S.\nBeijing has maintained that it is Manila stirring up trouble in the region, acting as a pawn in Washington's efforts to contain China.\nWhat to Know\nVideo shared to X (formerly Twitter) by Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela showed the 541-foot CCG-5901, the world's largest coast guard vessel, being intercepted by the much smaller BRP Cabra. Tarriela had suggested Sunday that the ship's presence was aimed at intimidating local fishermen.\nThe post included videos in which Philippine personnel could be heard informing the much larger vessel that it was within 76 nautical miles (87 miles) of the Southeast Asian country's coastline. An exclusive economic zone extends 200 nautical miles from a country's coastline, granting that state sole rights to natural resources under maricreated_at law.\nChina claims control over nearly all the South China Sea, which includes the exclusive economic zones of several neighbors, such as the Philippines. Since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office in 2022, Manila has increasingly pushed back, prompting Chinese maricreated_at forces to step up their presence in Philippine waters.\nChinese state media outlet the Global created_ats on Monday dismissed the stir caused by \"the Monster's\" presence in Philippine media, accusing the country of creating \"photo ops\" aimed at discrediting China's maricreated_at law enforcement actions.\nWhat People Are Saying\nJay Tarriela, spokesperson for the Philippine Coast Guard: \"Observations reveal that the CCG vessel's erratic movements indicate it is not engaged in innocent passage but rather asserts that it is conducting a law enforcement operation, claiming jurisdiction over these waters as belonging to the People's Republic of China.\"\nRay Powell, director of Stanford University-affiliated maricreated_at analyst group SeaLight: \"Since arriving on station yesterday, the Philippine Coast Guard's 330-ton BRP Cabra has been driving circles around the 12,000-ton 'Monster' China Coast Guard 5901. Cabra has been moving at 5-9 knots, while the 'Monster' has been lumbering at 2-5 knots, 55-70 (63-80 miles) from the Luzon coast.\"\nLuzon is the Philippines' most populous island, home to the capital Manila.\nDing Duo, deputy director of the Research Center for International and Regional Studies at China's National Institute for South China Sea Studies: \"After China announced the baselines of the territorial sea adjacent to Huangyan Dao, both the PLA (People's Liberation Army) Navy and the CCG are set to increase their routine patrols and exercises in the area, and the Philippines needs to adapt to this process,\" Ding told the Global created_ats.\nHuangyan Dao is China's name for Scarborough Shoal, known in Manila as Bajo De Masinloc, a disputed feature within the Philippine EEZ.\nWhat's Next\nChina is likely to continue deploying its coast guard, paramilitary \"Maricreated_at Militia,\" and navy to back its sweeping claims in the South China Sea.\nPresident Joe Biden and other administration officials have been vocal in their criticism of Chinese aggression within the Philippines' maricreated_at zone, which has included water cannon blasts and ramming. They have also stressed that the Mutual Defense Treaty is \"ironclad.\"\nIt remains to be seen how the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump will approach the issue.\nTarriela said: \"The Philippine Coast Guard reaffirms its dedication to protecting the nation's maricreated_at interests and will continue to monitor the activities of the CCG's illegitimate presence.\"\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nPhilippines Monitors Chinese Coast Guard Ship\nPhilippine Coast Guard\nPhilippines Monitors Chinese Coast Guard Ship\n"

    "text": "\n Filipino congressman Robert Ace Barbers' call comes after a drone was recovered off Masbate, which he says could be a spying device   \nA Philippine lawmaker's call for an additional US military site to help counter foreign intrusions and potential resource exploitation following the recovery of a submarine drone allegedly from China has drawn mixed reactions from analysts and politicians. \nFilipino congressman Robert Ace Barbers of Surigao del Norte said that having a naval base under the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) in the south, particularly in his province, was crucial for protecting the country's eastern seaboard, which is rich in deuterium deposits. \nDeuterium, a type of hydrogen, is used in fusion reactors and has various military, industrial, and scientific uses. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nBarbers warned in a statement last Thursday that foreign actors might be conducting intelligence operations targeting deuterium and other mineral resources in Philippine waters. \nHe was referring to the yellow drone, marked \"HY-119\", retrieved by Filipino fishermen from the waters off the province of Masbate in the central Philippines. \n\"It is not far-fetched that China has long been conducting in-depth intel gathering inside Philippine waters, possibly including data about deuterium,\" Barbers said. \nBrigadier General Andre Dizon, the province's police commander, earlier said the drone - suspected of being of Chinese origin - was used to communicate with satellites and other surface units. He said it was capable of sending and receiving data and voice messages. \nThe Armed Forces of the Philippines said the navy was investigating the origin and purpose of the drone. \nDefence analyst Jose Antonio Custodio told This Week in Asia that Barbers' proposal was feasible given that US troops had been stationed on Mindanao in the southern Philippines for 20 years for the war on terrorism. \nCustodio, a fellow at the Consortium of Indo-Pacific Researchers, said having another EDCA site would be beneficial to Manila as the Americans could help monitor certain areas, such as the Surigao Strait's exit into the Pacific Ocean. \n\"You can shut it off from the Chinese or to any hostile presence by establishing the capability to monitor and protect that particular strait,\" Custodio said. \nBarbers' brother, Surigao del Norte Governor Lyndon Barbers, has been advocating for an EDCA site to be built on the country's southeastern side due to the potential for intrusions such as the drone incident. \nSeparately, Robert Ace Barbers also responded to the proposal by the Department of National Defence and the navy to develop a naval facility within the 3,000-hectare Phividec Industrial Authority complex in Misamis Oriental to support the nearby Lumbia airbase located in Cagayan de Oro City in Mindanao. \n\"While I do not question the logic and wisdom behind the plan to put up an EDCA naval site inside the Phividec facility, I think it would be prudent for us not to intermix the business complex with a military complex,\" Barbers said. \nIn 2023, Manila gave the US access to four new military sites, on top of an existing five under EDCA, which allows Washington to rotate troops and preposition defence material, equipment and supplies in specific locations in the country. \nThe four new bases include one on Palawan island facing the South China Sea, and three in northern Luzon, some 400km from Taiwan. \nThe hosting of US troops in the country is covered by the Visiting Forces Agreement, which was signed in 1999 and sets the terms under which American military personnel can operate on Philippine soil. \nCustodio said another EDCA site could help the Philippines bolster its strategic position in the region. \n\"The role of the Philippines is like a cork plugging a bottle. So, we are basically the barrier against China expanding into the Pacific. You shut it off from the Chinese to contain them to operate only in the South China Sea,\" he added. \nVincent Kyle Parada, a former defence analyst for the Philippine Navy, said when Manila adopted the new Comprehensive Archipelagic Defence Concept (CADC), it was intended to cover beyond the West Philippine Sea to include vital areas in the eastern seaboard such as Benham Rise and the rest of the Philippine Sea. \nThe CADC is Manila's new strategy designed to protect the country's exclusive economic zone, which is located in what it calls the West Philippine Sea. \n\"Strategic basing is a key component of CADC, so in that sense, a naval facility in Surigao del Norte would be aligned with the defence establishment's ongoing efforts,\" Parada said. \n\"I think the ball is really in Washington's court if they want to further expand EDCA moving forward. If we take a look at the current sites, most are located in areas facing Taiwan and the South China Sea. Those are the key strategic interests for the US as far as its relationship with the Philippines is concerned.\" \nWhile a new facility might benefit the Philippines, Parada said that convincing the US could be a challenge. \nDefence expert Joshua Espeña said adding another defence point on the eastern seaboard was crucial for Manila's Active Archipelagic Defence Concept, especially to deal with purported foreign threats such as the drone incident. \nGiven widespread political support for President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr's government to deepen the alliance with the US, Espeña described Barbers' proposal as feasible. \n\"An EDCA site will make the area more proactive in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities,\" Espeña, who is also a lecturer at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, told This Week in Asia. \nCiting the eastern Dinagat Islands as a potential EDCA site, Espeña said: \"It is possible that US foreign military financing efforts can transform the area for berthing of vessels or even airstrips for air assets.\" \nThe move towards closer military ties with the US, however, has drawn opposition from some quarters, including former president Rodrigo Duterte and his daughter Vice-President Sara Duterte-Carpio. \nCarlos Isagani Zarate, a former member of the House of Representatives and the Bayan Muna party who is an opponent of EDCA sites, has dismissed Barbers' proposal. \n\"The EDCA sites undermine our country's sovereignty. The presence of foreign troops and facilities could escalate regional tensions and drag the Philippines into conflicts that are not our own,\" he warned. \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "text": "\nChina has a new military aircraft that can detect U.S. combat jets approaching the country's airspace at longer ranges, experts told Newsweek.\nNewsweek has contacted the Pentagon and Chinese Defense Ministry for comment by email.\nWhy It Matters\nClayton Swope, the deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project and a senior fellow in the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Newsweek there is some concern that the new Chinese military airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, known as the KJ-3000, \"could detect stealth aircraft.\"\nThe ability to detect stealth aircraft could give China a significant new edge, Swope added, which could complicate the U.S.'s ability to project airpower across the western Pacific Ocean, including over the contested South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.\nWhat To Know\nThe KJ-3000 has a design based on the Y-20B transport aircraft. In December, photos of its maiden flight, which reportedly occurred the month prior, circulated on social media after the emergence of two Chinese next-generation combat aircraft prototypes.\nServing as \"eyes and ears\" in the air, the KJ-3000 is designed to detect aircraft and cruise missiles and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the operational environments in real created_at, reported the Aviationist, a military aviation website. It is expected to have a rotodome that houses its radar antenna, which provides 360-degree coverage.\nChina operates three types of AEW&C aircraft—the KJ-200, the KJ-500 and the KJ-2000—which amplify its ability to detect, track and target threats in varying conditions, in larger volumes, and at greater distances, the Pentagon said in its 2024 report on China's military power.\nThe U.S. military has several types of stealth aircraft in service, including the F-22 and F-35 fighter jets and the B-2 and B-21 bombers. They use low observable technology, also known as stealth technology, to become less visible to radar detection.\nHow Does the KJ-3000 Fit China's Military Strategy\nKitsch Liao, the associate director of the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, told Newsweek that the KJ-3000 could extend the Chinese air force's power projection beyond the first island chain, a north-south blockade formed against China by Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines.\nBoth the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait are within the first island chain, one of the three layers of a U.S. defense concept that seeks to leverage the territories of Washington's allies and partners in the region to contain the Chinese air and naval forces in warcreated_at.\nThe KJ-3000 is part of the Chinese land-based airpower, which has a role in the country's counter-intervention plan to potential U.S. assistance to Taiwan, Liao added. Beijing has claimed the self-ruled island as its own and has refused to renounce using force against it.\nEquipped with advanced radar and sensors and offered longer endurance, the KJ-3000 is more capable than its predecessors and enables China to track enemy units, potentially including stealth jets, at much greater distances, David Cenciotti, the editor of the Aviationist, told Newsweek.\nThe development of a state-of-the-art AEW&C aircraft, as well as advanced missiles and stealth fighter jets, is part of Beijing's strategy to extend its military operations farther from home and challenge anyone who might \"stand in their way,\" he added.\nThe new aircraft represents a significant step forward in completing the Chinese airpower's counter-intervention posture, Liao said. The aircraft can reportedly reach a higher altitude, providing an estimated radar horizon of 400 km (249 miles)—its maximum detection range.\n\"Compared with the propeller-driven KJ-500, it [the KJ-3000] can be moved out toward a combat area faster and has better range,\" veteran aerospace journalist and former industry executive Bill Sweetman told Newsweek. The KJ-3000 is powered by four turbofan engines.\nThe aircraft can track targets at long range with enough accuracy to guide long-range antiair weapons, whether launched from fighter jets, ships or the ground, Sweetman said.\nWhat People Are Saying\nClayton Swope, the deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project, said: \"China prioritizes the ability to conduct surveillance across the South China Sea and into the Pacific Ocean to keep tabs on what the United States and its allies are doing there.\"\nKitsch Liao, the associate director of the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, said: \"The KJ-3000 alone would still be required to operate under the protective umbrella of Chinese land-based IADS [integrated air defense system] or airpower, thus the power projection capability extended by mere advent of KJ-3000 would be incremental and limited without a comprehensive assessment on the overall capability of Chinese airpower to maintain control of the air beyond its coastal safe zones.\"\nDavid Cenciotti, the editor of the Aviationist, said: \"The KJ-3000 isn't a game changer on its own, but it's a key asset to complement the existing fleet of AEW [airborne early warning] aircraft. It highlights how China is trying to catch up with the U.S. and NATO, building the kind of multilayered architecture to project power across the Indo-Pacific and beyond.\"\nBill Sweetman, a veteran aerospace journalist and former industry executive, said: \"So what we're seeing is the development and deployment of families of systems, including advanced manned aircraft, strike drones, missiles and sensor platforms. The KJ-3000 is interesting because China has produced four or five large airborne radar systems, and not entirely just to provide information to fighters.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nIt remains to be seen when the Chinese military will officially announce the KJ-3000 and put it into service. Flight tests of the AEW&C aircraft are likely to continue in the new year.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nChina Displays KJ-500 AEW&C Aircraft\nPower Sport Images/Getty Images\nA KJ-500 airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft on display at the China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition (Airshow China 2016) in Zhuhai, China, on November 2, 2016.

    "text": "\nThe Philippine media outlet Inquirer.net reported on Monday that the China Coast Guard (CCG) Vessel 5901 was sighted 100 kilometers (54 nautical miles) from Capones Island through Canada's Dark Vessel Detection system, Commodore Jay Tarriela, Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesperson, said in a statement he sent to reporters on Saturday night. Tarriela also said that the PCG vessel and aircraft continuously challenged the presence of the Chinese coast guard, and claimed that it was operating within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ), according to Inquirer.net.The deployment of CCG ship 5901 has attracted significant attention from Philippine media. Outlets such as GMA News have even referred to the 5901 as a \"monster ship.\" According to GMA's report, compared to the 2,265-ton displacement of the BRP Teresa Magbanua and Melchora Aquino, the largest ships in the PCG inventory, CCG ship 5901 is at 12,000 tons and is considered to be the largest coast guard ship in the world.GMA News also said that according to a report by Chino Gaston on 24 Oras Weekend, by using dark vessel detection technology from Canada, the PCG detected the CCG ship and deployed the BRP Cabra and a Caravan reconnaissance aircraft to intercept and monitor the Chinese ship.The PCG claimed that the Chinese ship is \"intended to intimidate Filipino fishermen,\" yet Tarriela said that so far the Chinese ship has not harassed Filipino fishermen in the area, according to the GMA News report.This is not the first created_at the Philippines has hyped up the normal patrol and law enforcement activities of CCG ship 5901 in the South China Sea. \nIn July 2024, during the illegal stay of PCG vessels in the waters near China's Xianbin Jiao, the Philippines also maliciously hyped up the patrol and law enforcement activities of the ship 5901 near China's Ren'ai Jiao and Xianbin Jiao. Ding Duo, director of Research Center for International and regional studies, National Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the Global created_ats on Monday that it is evident that the Philippines is continuously promoting its \"transparency initiative,\" not only constantly creating incidents for \"photo ops\" but also trying every means to discredit China's maricreated_at law enforcement actions aimed at safeguarding its rights.\"After China announced the baselines of the territorial sea adjacent to Huangyan Dao, both the PLA Navy and the CCG are set to increase their routine patrols and exercises in the area, and the Philippines needs to adapt to this process,\" Ding said, noting that following the announcement of the baseline, China's management and control over Huangyan Dao are bound to tighten, and the Philippine side needs to get used to the increased intensity and changes in China's law enforcement actions to safeguard its rights.Since December 2024, the CCG has continuously strengthened law enforcement patrols in the territorial waters and surrounding areas of Huangyan Dao, monitoring and driving away illegal harassing vessels, further enhancing control over the relevant maricreated_at areas. A shipborne helicopter was for the first created_at deployed in the waters around Huangyan Dao to conduct maricreated_at search and rescue training. On New Year's Day, all the law enforcement officers of the Chuanshan ship held a flag raising ceremony in the waters around Huangyan Island, according to CCTV.Ding noted that after the baseline of territorial waters around Huangyan Dao was announced, the scope of the waters under China's jurisdiction near Huangyan Dao has become clear. This area is definitely not within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, as they claimed, Ding said.The law enforcement activities conducted by the CCG in the waters near Huangyan Dao are entirely justified. The routine monitoring and alert operation carried out by the CCG in this area are by no means the threats, coercion or intimidation of Filipino fishermen as claimed by the Philippine side, Ding noted. \"If the Philippine side does not intend to infringe or provoke, there is no need to have a guilty conscience,\" the expert said. \n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-06",
    "text": "\nThe arms race in the Asia-Pacific will intensify this year, observers believe, with several governments in the region - including US treaty allies Japan and the Philippines - planning big boosts to their defence budgets. \nThe aim is to both counter China and to hedge against uncertainties over incoming US president Donald Trump, they added.  \nThe Japanese government's 2025 budget approved last Friday included record defence spending of 8.7 trillion yen (HK$430 billion), despite recent signs of a thaw in ties with China under Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. \nIt is the 13th straight annual increase in the defence budget as Japan seeks to address concerns over China's rise and North Korea's military alignment with Russia, according to analysts. \nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr last week signed the country's 2025 budget into law, with defence spending expected to reach a record 315.1 billion pesos (HK$42 billion). This is more than 30 per cent higher than the 2024 military budget, official news agency Xinhua reported.  \nIt is also much higher than the original total of 256.1 billion pesos amid heightened tensions with Beijing in the South China Sea. \nPhilippine budget secretary Amenah Pangandaman said the increase was to help \"uphold our sovereignty and territorial integrity\". \nNi Lexiong, a Shanghai-based military analyst, said Trump had repeatedly demanded that US allies and partners boost military spending to counter Russia and China. \n\"The influence of the Trump factor can be felt everywhere around the world,\" Ni said, \"In a way, such a seemingly extreme strategy that drew widespread criticism has proven effective so far, as many US allies in Europe and Asia, dependent on the US for security, have no choice but to comply with his demands.\" \nBut for Benoit Hardy-Chartrand, an international affairs specialist at Tokyo's Temple University Japan, China remains the primary driver for the budget increases in Japan and the Philippines. \"Japan has for many years considered China its foremost security challenge, despite its desire to maintain stable and productive relations with its neighbour,\" he said. \nTokyo's concerns regarding Beijing are \"manifold\", according to Hardy-Chartrand, ranging from their territorial dispute in the East China Sea and Beijing's growing strategic partnership with Moscow, to concerns over a potential conflict over Taiwan. \nBeijing regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. Japan and the US, in common with most countries, do not recognise the island as an independent state, but oppose any attempt to seize it by force. \nFor the Philippines, the stakes are even higher, with its long-simmering maricreated_at dispute with China becoming increasingly tense and violent. \nBoth sides have also exchanged barbs in recent weeks over Manila's plans to buy the US-made Typhon missile system.  \nPhilippine military chief Lieutenant-General Roy Galido said it was necessary for \"protecting our sovereignty\", but the Chinese foreign ministry condemned it as \"provocative and dangerous ... and extremely irresponsible\" as well as warning of the risk of \"geopolitical confrontation and an arms race\". \nYun Sun, director of the China programme and co-director of the East Asia programme at the Stimson Centre in Washington, said given the recent trajectory of Beijing's ties with the two neighbouring countries and Taiwan, it should come as no surprise that they were increasing their defence budgets. \nBut she said Trump was not the key factor, noting Japan increased its 2024 defence budget by 7.5 per cent as well.  \n\"China might see Japan and the Philippines as irrationally responding to China's peaceful rise. But the lack of understanding of other countries' security anxieties due to China's growing military power, presence and activities in their periphery is a fundamental contributing factor to regional arms race,\" Sun said.  \nNi said missile programmes by the Philippines and Japan, which is preparing to deploy long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, were clearly aimed at China and offensive in nature. \nIn a speech on New Year's Eve, President Xi Jinping again warned of \"high winds, choppy waters, and even dangerous storms,\" as the country tackles growing domestic and external challenges.  \nAccording to Ni, this indicates China is poised to raise its own defence spending, speed up military reforms, and upgrade weapons and military equipment. \n The Pentagon issued its latest report on China's military power last month. It said despite anti-corruption probes into many top commanders, China had continued to build a global military and a world-class defence industrial base with robust nuclear forces. \n\"The arms race will undoubtedly intensify,\" Ni said. \"All parties are readying their forces and bolstering deterrence, no one wants to go into a costly war but there is still the risk of accidental conflicts,\" he said. \n The situation in the South China Sea and the broader Asia-Pacific region will largely hinge on Beijing's attitude, Trump's Asia policy and the future of China-US ties, he added. \nHardy-Chartrand said the Japanese and Philippine defence budget increases do not constitute a major departure from their long-standing defence stances.  \nJapan adopted a new defence strategy in 2022, aiming to eventually double the military budget to become the world's third biggest military spender after the US and China. \nBut Hardy-Chartrand argued Trump is the biggest wild card in the region this year. \"[Trump] has yet to define what his China policy will look like beyond tariffs,\" he said.  \n\"Furthermore, if US relations with other allies like Japan and South Korea show signs of friction, as they did during his first stint in the White House, this will be beneficial to Beijing.\"\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-06",
    "text": "\nPresident Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr.’s move to reorganize the National Security Council (NSC), which saw the removal of Vice-President Sara Z. Duterte-Carpio and former presidents, is seen as necessary, security analysts said, noting this may be driven by geopolitical factors, particularly the Philippines’ increasingly complex relationship with China.\nMr. Marcos struck a balance between having more views at the table and trimming down the number of people who can access intelligence information due to a foreign aggressor that is likely working with local elites, said Joshua Bernard B. Espeña, who teaches international relations at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines.\nHe was referring to China, which claims the South China Sea almost in its entirety including waters within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\n“We consider the streamlining of views filtered by the chief executive. The fewer voices, the quicker one can decide especially in created_ats of crisis management,” he said in a Facebook Messenger.\nOn Jan. 4, Chinese Coast Guard’s ship dubbed “The Monster” brought its “intrusive patrol even further east from Scarborough Shoal.”\n“It is now asserting China’s claim of jurisdiction just 50 nautical miles from the Philippines’ main island of Luzon,” Raymond M. Powell, a fellow at Stanford University’s Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account.\n“The Monster” weighs 12,000 tons, 5 created_ats more than the Philippine Coast Guard’s two largest ships, according to Mr. Powell.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a Viber message seeking comment.\nThis followed the discovery of a suspected submersible drone from China in the central Philippines as the new year started.\nThe Philippine Navy is currently conducting its investigation to determine the origin and purpose of the sea drone, Xerxes A. Trinidad, chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Public Affairs Office, said in a statement last week.\nExecutive Order (EO) No. 81 reorganized the NSC by removing past presidents and the vice-president as members, citing the need to streamline its composition.\nBut Mr. Espeña said having past presidents at the table may also enable the government to have “historical insights” into security matters.\n“The more views at the table, the deeper insights the chief executive can have on national security decision-making, especially in making and executing a grand strategy,” he said.\n“The point is to strike a balance especially if certain views of the vice-president and former presidents are advantageous for national security interests,” he explained.\nMr. Espeña said Mr. Marcos “made a good decision” in trimming down the intelligence cycle “to deter pro-Chinese views in the official lines of communication at the trade-off against diversity of views.”\nMr. Espeña said the president, still, can invite and gather insights from former presidents despite their removal from the NSC.\n“But I suspect that the incumbent government wants to keep the intelligence cycle as tight as possible since a devil’s advocate is not tantamount to one with treacherous views.”\nExecutive Secretary Lucas P. Bersamin at the weekend clarified that “at the moment, the vice-president is not considered relevant to the responsibilities of membership in the NSC.”\n“Nonetheless, when the need arises, the EO reserves to the President the power to add members or advisers,” he added in a statement.\nThe NSC, which was established in 1950, said the reorganization was a response to the changing created_ats, citing the need “to further enhance the formulation of policies affecting national security.”\n“The NSC is, first and foremost, an advisory text to the President, and its composition is always subject to the authority of President,” National Security Advisor Eduardo M. Año said in a statement.\nHe noted that previous presidents such as Ferdinand E. Marcos, Sr., Corazon C. Aquino, Fidel V. Ramos, and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo reorganized the composition of the NSC to meet the President’s requirements and changing conditions.\n“Hence, the purpose of reorganization is to enhance the formulation of policies relating to national security so that actions and decisions thereon by the Presidents rests on sound advice and accurate information,” he said.\n“It is also premised on the need for created_atly and coherent action to address current and emerging threats to national security,” he added.\nChester B. Cabalza, founder and president of the Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, said the pragmatism of the move “boils down to the rationale that not all past presidents and vice-president are knowledgeable of national security.”\n“Trust is very important in the community of defense and security,” he said.\nMr. Cabalza earlier told BusinessWorld that China may support politicians in their political campaigns amid growing tensions in the South China Sea.\nChinese intrusions into Philippine waters have prompted Manila to gradually shift to an external security orientation, launching the Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept (CADC) last year to put focus on the country’s maricreated_at zones.\nJosue Raphael J. Cortez, a diplomacy instructor at the De La Salle- College of St. Benilde’s School of Diplomacy and Governance, said the president’s move may be due to the Duterte family’s alliance with the Chinese government.\n“In cognizance with the continuous militarization of the disputed territories, the Chief Executive might be wary of engaging the VP in discussions pertinent to the matter,” he said in a Messenger chat.\nMs. Duterte’s father, former President Rodrigo R. Duterte, notably pursued closer ties with Beijing during his term from 2016 to 2022, softening Manila’s stance on the South China Sea disputes and securing billions in pledges for loans and investments.\nMr. Cortez added the vice-president’s removal may also reflect the “nuances in today’s security landscape” as other government personnel or agencies, and private people, may be appointed members of the NSC.\n“Given that security challenges today are not merely state-centric anymore and now involve nonstate actors, then hearing their perspectives in the text is undoubtedly vital,” he said.\nMs. Duterte’s removal can also be due to the soured relationship with Mr. Marcos, he said, which saw a once formidable alliance that led to their 2022 victory devolve into political tension.\nFrom a global perspective, the move would not have a direct effect on Manila’s international partnerships, he added.\n“However, of course, we need to be pragmatic enough that the Chinese Communist Party and China as a whole may view this as a propaganda geared towards ensuring that pro-China people in the public sector are being undermined in light of our tensions with them.\nPOLITICALLY MOTIVATED\nAteneo Policy Center fellow Michael Henry Ll. Yusingco, on the other hand, said the move reeks of partisanship.\n“National security should be beyond partisan politics. But every president has failed to de-politicize national security,” he said in a Messenger chat.\n“The President certainly has the authority to reorganize the NSC but never for partisan reasons. In fact, there can only be one reason for a public official or any person for that matter to be excluded from the NSC,” he added.\nMr. Marcos needs to prove that the vice-president “is a verified threat to our national security,” Mr. Yusingco said.\n“The only way for the Pre(sident) to convince the public that this was not a partisan political move is for him to demonstrate that the VP is a national security threat,” he explained.\n“No other rationale will make this move reasonable or appropriate,” he added. “Simply asserting his authority to do reorganize the NSC just reinforces the suspicion that the exclusion of the VP is politically motivated.”\nFormer Bayan Muna Rep. Neri J. Colmenares said the move to reorganize the NSC “reflects the intensifying power struggle between the country’s dominant political dynasties ahead of the mid-term elections.”\n“This is not just about national security — this is about political survival,” he said in a statement.\nHe said the NSC reorganization might signal deeper problems within the administration.\n“Their removal may also indicate fears of a possible rift within the military establishment, which could have serious implications for the country’s stability.”\nMs. Duterte’s expulsion from the NSC further diminished her role in Mr. Marcos’ government, as she had previously resigned from the presidential Cabinet, leaving her education minister post and deputy leadership of the country’s anti-insurgency task force.\nHansley A. Juliano, who teaches political science at the Ateneo, while the NSC reorganization may make sense in the long run in terms of the President’s security policy, it may set a bad precedent for making security issues a bipartisan concern.\n“Foreign policy is institutionally a bipartisan concern: the expectation is that foreign affairs need to remain stable/consistent even when regimes change,” he said via Messenger chat.\n“It’s what is good for business and labor migration after all.”\nUnder the new EO, NSC members are the Senate President; Speaker of the House of Representatives; Senate President Pro-Tempore; Three Deputy Speakers to be designated by the Speaker; Majority Floor Leader of the Senate; Majority Floor Leader of the House; Minority Floor Leader of the Senate; Minority Floor Leader of the House; Chairpersons of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Senate Committee on National Defense and Security, Peace, Unification and Reconciliation, and Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs.\nAlso part of the council are the chairpersons of House Committee on Foreign Affairs, House Committee on National Defense and Security, House Committee on Public Order and Safety; Executive Secretary; National Security Adviser; Secretaries of Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Justice, Department of National Defense, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Labor and Employment, Presidential Communications Office; Chief Presidential Legal Counsel; Head of the Presidential Legislative Liaison Office; and other government officials and private citizens appointed by the President.\nThe Director-General of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA), the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), the Chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP), and the Director of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) shall attend the meetings of the council “as may be necessary to advise and assist in its deliberations,” Malacañang said.\nThe Governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) may also be invited to participate in the NSC, it added.\nThe NSC’s executive committee is now composed of the President as chairperson, with members composed of the Executive Secretary, Senate President or his representative, Speaker of the House of Representatives or his representative, National Security Adviser, the secretaries of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Justice, Department of National Defense, Department of the Interior and Local Government, and other members or advisers designated by the President.\n"

    "text": "\n The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) sent one of its patrol ships and two aircraft to monitor China's biggest coast guard ship after it was spotted off the coast of Zambales province on Saturday.\nDubbed 'The Monster,' China Coast Guard (CCG) Vessel 5901 was sighted 100 kilometers (54 nautical miles) from Capones Island through Canada's Dark Vessel Detection system, Commodore Jay Tarriela, PCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, said in a statement he sent to reporters on Saturday night.\nThis prompted the PCG to deploy its BRP Cabra (MRRV-4409), along with a helicopter and Caravan aircraft, to verify the incursion and assert their presence, he added.\n'The PCG vessel and aircraft continuously challenged the presence of the Chinese coast guard, emphasizing that it was operating within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in accordance with the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Law and Unclos,' Tarriela said, referring to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nAs of Sunday, the Chinese vessel was approximately 120 to 130 km (65 to 70 nautical miles) from Zambales while the BRP Cabra kept watch.\n'The PCG remains committed to closely monitoring this Chinese coast guard vessel to ensure that Filipino fishermen can operate safely and without harassment within our exclusive economic zone,' Tarriela said.\n'The Monster' is also the world's largest coast guard vessel at 12,000 tons. It arrived near Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal on Jan. 1 to boost Beijing's control over the maricreated_at area, according to Ray Powell, director of the SeaLight project at Stanford University who tracks South China Sea activities through satellite imaging. Three other CCG ships and seven maricreated_at militia vessels were also at the shoal.\nPanatag Shoal or Bajo de Masinloc lies 222 km (120 nautical miles) from the mainland west of Luzon, well within the country's EEZ.\nCalled Huangyan Dao by China, it is nearly 926 km (500 nautical miles) from the nearest major Chinese landmass of Hainan.\nBeijing took hold of the shoal in 2012 after a two-month standoff with the Philippine Navy, prompting Manila to file a case against China before an international arbitral tribunal the following year.\nThe court ruled in 2016 that Beijing's so-called nine-dash-line claim had no basis under international law.\nFrequent incursions\nThis is not the first created_at 'The Monster' has been spotted within the country's EEZ. In May, it was seen 93 km (50 nautical miles) off Panatag which, according to Powell, was part of China's attempt to 'normalize' its presence and jurisdiction in these waters.\nFrom June 17 until it exited the country's EEZ 10 days later, the Chinese ship passed near 12 of the Philippines' maricreated_at features while occasionally providing supplies to Chinese vessels it encountered along the way.\nOn June 24, it was spotted near the BRP Sierra Madre which serves as the Philippines' military outpost in Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal.\nThe next day, it passed by El Nido, Palawan province, maintaining a close distance of 63 km (34 nautical miles) from the coastline.\nIt left the country's EEZ on June 27 only to return the following month. On July 3, Powell told the Inquirer the ship was spotted off Ayungin Shoal and was on its way to Panganiban (Mischief) Reef.\nThe incident took place amid ongoing talks between Manila and Beijing.\nThe BRP Teresa Magbanua reportedly issued a radio challenge against the vessel on the afternoon of its arrival, an hour before it anchored at Escoda (Sabina) Shoal at 6 p.m.\n'Going dark'\nOn July 31, the ship turned off its automatic identification system (AIS), making it harder to trace and monitor its movements, including for Powell. When asked why the ship turns off its AIS, Powell told the Inquirer that it was 'hard to say,' as 'it does go dark from created_at to created_at.'\nOn Aug. 10, the ship left Escoda Shoal's vicinity after anchoring there for more than a month.\nTarriela, however, reported that it was replaced by a 135-meter CCG vessel with hull No. 5903.\n"

    "text": "\n Over two years since I first pronounced World War 2.5, primarily due to the increasing intensities and dimensions of wars and conflicts in different regions.\nThe Russia-Ukraine war is likely to enter its fourth year, and the Gaza genocide continues without any meaningful break. Syria is being raised to the ground, and Yemen is the next target. Iran keeps guessing about its own created_at.\nWho is to blame for this morass? The flawed international system favours the relatively stronger states or the weak and corrupt leadership of the developing countries. If the interests of the state are of paramount importance based on the realist paradigm, why should the developing states not follow the same for themselves, and their leaders serve the purpose of the stronger states? This question will never be answered by any leader, serving or former, from any developing state.\nThere is little debate among academics and practitioners that power is primarily acquired to influence the behaviour of other states, be they friendly or adversarial. However, what remains to be debated is the methodologies adopted by the relatively stronger states to influence the behaviour of the relatively weaker or smaller states.\nSoon after World War II, the US-led Western countries adopted an anti-communist or containment of communism narrative and managed to control their former colonies through the installed regimes. Their control over most of the former African colonies is still in place even though China has started to make inroads through its bold diplomacy and economic incentives under the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI).\nUnder President Xi Jinping's bold leadership, China launched a global infrastructure development plan called BRI in 2013. The projects under the BRI include 'connecting people, financial integration, infrastructure connectivity, policy coordination, and unimpeded trade.'\nThe BRI, known as the One Belt One Road and the New Silk Road, is expected to complete its objectives by 2049. The projects under BRI span more than 150 countries and 30 international organisations. According to a World Bank report, the BRI increased trade by 4.1 percent and foreign investment by five per cent. Moreover, it has dramatically helped the host countries reduce poverty by creating at least 400,000 jobs.\nBack to US-led Western narratives of the Cold War era, which succeeded in breaking up the erstwhile Soviet Union in its quest to influence extra-regional states, such as in the Middle East, South Asia, South East Asia, and Africa. However, in the process, it ignored China's rise of China; the alliance is faced with a more significant challenge than before because Russia has consolidated itself since the breakup of the Soviet Union, and China has quietly risen to a level not anticipated by the US-led Western powers.\nTherefore, the enduring rivalries among the more considerable powers will continue in the coming decades, but with a different opponent. The US-led Western powers will now face China, which has a different philosophy of acquiring and employing power. China's differing political philosophy is already showing promise for its rising global aspirations, as it has successfully overtaken Japan as the second-largest economy and is now challenging the US to top the list of largest economies by 2028.\nMilitarily, the US will continue to enjoy the status of history's best-equipped and most potent force in the coming decades until China competes for the slot in that domain too. However, Chinese leadership does not consider military competition a priority, which is perhaps the right thing to do now. Perhaps, this is one reason that China, despite active disputes in the South China Sea, Taiwan and India, does not talk of resolving any of its conflicts using military power.\nIn my opinion, China would prefer to keep Russia on the military front and continue to develop its economy so that it has enough surplus to invest in modernizing its military in the coming decades. Perhaps this is one reason why China has gone the extra mile to support Russia in its war against Ukraine, knowing fully well that the US-led NATO is actively supporting Ukrainian forces in their training and latest military equipment.\nIt is evident that enduring rivalry for the status of superpower will continue even at the cost of destroying the relatively smaller and weaker states, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia. Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Gaza, and even Ukraine will never be the same again.\nThe only reason behind this madness is the acquisition of more and more power to influence the behaviour of the other states. China does it through its soft power, whereas US-led Western powers are continuing the old-styled use of hard power through sanctions, compellence, regime change, and, if needed, physical violence.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-06",
    "text": "\nThe U.S.-Republic of Korea (ROK) Alliance is ironclad andbuilt upon our shared values of freedom and democracy, human rights and the rule of law. However, with the recent political turmoil in South Korea, our economic and security alliance must remain strong. Despite facing one of its greatest challenges, I have faith in the democratic commitment of the Korean people.  \nThe United States must pay attention. Why? Because South Korea is a key ally in keeping the Indo-Pacific free and open. As growing aggression from North Korea and malign influence from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) threaten a free and open Indo-Pacific, the U.S.-ROK alliance is more important than ever to deter these threats and promote peace through strength. \nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and Acting President Han Duck-soo were both impeached in the span of weeks, and arrest warrants against President Yoon have been granted — continuing the political instability and polarization in the country. \nWhile media coverage, including in the United States, has focused heavily on anti-Yoon protests, Koreans protesting the impeachment have also come out every day to Gwanghwamun in the heart of Seoul to wave South Korean and American flags. Regrettably, these images have been mostly ignored by Western media. \nWhile the U.S.-ROK alliance enjoys wide bipartisan support in the United States, factions, including those that have led the presidential impeachments in South Korea, have been working to undermine the alliance and the U.S.-ROK-Japan trilateral partnership. With the CCP’s expanding naval presence and unprecedented developments in North Korea’s relationship with Russia, the trilateral partnership’s long-term sustainability is vital for regional stability.\nNow is the created_at to expand our joint exercises, people-to-people exchanges, and intelligence and technology cooperation, not back down. Unfortunately, the original impeachment motion against President Yoon accused him of antagonizing North Korea, China and Russia, isolating South Korea within Northeast Asia, and being too pro-Japan.  \nThis same faction is pushing for a formal declaration to end the Korean War, which I have consistently opposed until we ensure full, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea and North Korean fundamental human rights are respected. A unilateral end of war declaration without concessions from North Korea would undermine and destabilize security on the Korean Peninsula.  \nSuch a premature declaration would also pose risks for U.S. forces in South Korea. Even as a political statement, this declaration gives North Korea and China the perfect talking point to demand the withdrawal of nearly 29,000 troops from the Korean Peninsula, the dismantlement of U.S. Forces South Korea, and the permanent termination of annual U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises. Further, declaring unconditional peace handicaps our ability to accomplish critical national security objectives in the region. \nThe erosion of our combined deterrence and faith in our alliance would have grave consequences for regional security in the Indo-Pacific. Our enemies like the CCP and North Korean regime are looking for ways to exploit weaknesses in our alliances and take advantage of any precarious situation. Political turmoil and increasing anti-U.S. propaganda in South Korea give our adversaries a green light. \nThe CCP’s malign influence is growing bolder and brazen by the day; intimidation tactics and direct attacks against our allies in the South China Sea and efforts to hack global telecommunications networks — including now 9 U.S. telecom firms — are the new norm. In addition, according to our State Department, the CCP spends billions of dollars annually on foreign information manipulation efforts and conducts a massive information manipulation campaign to reshape the global information landscape. We must counter this and support our allies.   \nWe also cannot turn a blind eye to North Korea’s aggression, nuclear ambitions and human rights abuses. That is why I introduced the North Korea Human Rights Reauthorization Act, which passed the House this Congress in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion. Unfortunately, the Senate failed to take up the bill. In the new Congress, countering the North Korean regime and promoting U.S. leadership and values around the world will continue to be top priorities of mine.  \nThe U.S.-ROK alliance must not fall on deaf ears in the United States or in South Korea. Stability and true democratic governance in South Korea are critically important for the United States to maintain a peaceful, free and open Indo-Pacific. Both Congress and the current and incoming administrations must work to ensure our continued commitment to the U.S.-ROK alliance and a free and democratic South Korea. \nYoung Kim represents California’s 40th District.\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.\n"

    "text": "\nAccording to information published by the US DoD on January 4, 2025, the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70), flagship of Carrier Strike Group One (CSG 1), is actively conducting routine flight operations in the South China Sea as part of its deployment within the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations.\nThe South China Sea remains one of the most contested maricreated_at regions globally, with overlapping claims from multiple nations, including China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia. China's expansive claims and militarization of artificial islands have escalated tensions over the years. By conducting routine flight operations, the USS Carl Vinson underscores the United States' commitment to the principle of freedom of navigation. This principle is pivotal to ensuring that no single nation can unilaterally control vital sea lanes, through which an estimated $4 trillion in annual trade flows.\nRoutine U.S. Navy operations in these waters serve as a counterbalance to Chinas aggressive stance, demonstrating the U.S. Navys capability and willingness to operate freely in the region. This presence is a reassurance to regional allies and partners who rely on unimpeded maricreated_at access for their economic and security interests.\nThe timing and location of the Carl Vinsons operations are significant. The South China Sea has seen an uptick in military activity, including frequent encounters between U.S. and Chinese forces. By deploying a carrier strike group to these waters, the U.S. sends a clear signal to Beijing that its actions in the region are being closely monitored and that attempts to intimidate smaller nations will not go unchecked.\nThis deployment also coincides with increased diplomatic efforts by the United States to strengthen its position in the Indo-Pacific, including the Quad framework (U.S., Japan, India, Australia) and AUKUS (Australia, UK, U.S.).\nWhile these operations reaffirm U.S. commitment to the region, they are not without risks. The South China Sea has been a hotspot for military near-misses and confrontations, particularly with Chinas navy and maricreated_at militia. There is always a risk of miscalculation leading to unintended escalation.\nAdditionally, the deployment of a carrier strike group is resource-intensive, raising questions about the sustainability of such operations over created_at, particularly as the U.S. faces challenges in other regions, such as Europe and the Middle East.\n"

    "text": "\n Observers interpret the presence of the 165-metre vessel near Scarborough Shoal as a warning to Manila about its military ties with the US   \nA huge Chinese coastguard vessel was spotted sailing in contested waters last weekend, in what analysts saw as a pointed warning to the Philippines over its growing military alliance with the US. \nNicknamed \"the monster\" for its 165-metre (180-yard) length, the world's largest coastguard ship was spotted over the weekend near Scarborough Shoal, which China calls Huangyan Island. The shoal has long been a flashpoint in the South China Sea. \nUsing Canada's advanced detection technology, the Philippine coastguard tracked the Chinese vessel as it manoeuvred through the West Philippine Sea, a term Manila uses for the parts of the South China Sea within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In a video posted by the Philippine coastguard, BRP Cabra, a Philippine patrol vessel, radioed the Chinese ship to demand that it leave Philippine waters. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \n\"CCG 5901. This is BRP Cabra, MMRV 4409. We are reminding you that you are within 72.6 nautical miles west by the south of Silanguin, Zambales in the Philippine exclusive economic zone. Please leave this area immediately. Over,\" the Philippine crew said, referring to the bow numbers of the two vessels. \nAs of Monday evening, the Philippine coastguard reported that the Chinese vessel remained in the area and was last spotted 148km (80 nautical miles) from Lubang Island in Occidental Mindoro. Coastguard spokesman Jay Tarriela accused the vessel of carrying out \"erratic movements\" inconsistent with innocent passage. \nThe Chinese coastguard replied to the radio call and said: \"The so-called award for the South China Sea arbitration is illegal and invalid. China neither accepts it nor recognises it,\" referring to the 2016 international tribunal ruling that invalidated Beijing's claims in the region. \n\"I hope you will safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea and maintain mutual trust and cooperation between our countries with concrete action.\" \nJonathan Malaya, spokesman for the Philippine National Security Council, blasted the Chinese vessel's presence as an act of \"intimidation, coercion, and aggression\" during a briefing on Monday. While Malaya noted the vessel had not engaged in dangerous manoeuvres or blocked Philippine ships, he emphasised that the Philippine government was prepared to respond to any provocations. \n\"We are not neglecting this, fellow countrymen. We have all our assets directed at this monster ship, and the moment it commits any wrongdoing ... it will be met with the appropriate response from the government,\" Malaya said. \nExperts interpreted the deployment of the Chinese vessel as a calculated show of force rather than an overtly aggressive act. Alan Chong, a senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described the vessel's presence as a \"propaganda manoeuvre\", noting that China's use of a coastguard ship rather than a navy vessel signalled a desire to project strength without risking outright conflict. \n\"A coastguard ship of whatever size is not a warship by definition. But the fact that the Chinese did not send a full-scale People's Liberation Army Navy vessel shows they are using propaganda manoeuvre within limits,\" Chong said. \nChester Cabalza, president of Manila's International Development and Security Cooperation think tank, said the deployment was as much about showcasing China's marine engineering prowess as it was about intimidating the Philippines. \"It's a megalomaniac act from Beijing ... [to] innovate giant and monster ships for the world to praise them in awe,\" Cabalza said. \nSecurity analyst Matteo Piasentini downplayed the incident, calling it a tactic by China to pressure its neighbours. \"Should the Philippines be concerned about different forms of Chinese grey zone tactics and the presence of their coastguard and maricreated_at militia vessels in its EEZ? Yes. Should it be particularly concerned in this specific instance? Not more than the usual,\" Piasentini said. \nSome analysts believe the timing of the deployment is no coincidence. \nRenato Cruz De Castro, an international studies professor at De La Salle University, argued that Beijing was signalling its displeasure with Manila's deepening defence ties with Washington, including its plans to acquire the US-made Typhon missile system. \n\"At the start of the year, we're already being warned: 'Don't challenge us, don't provoke us, because we can crush you.' It's a clear show of force,\" De Castro said. He told ABS-CBN News that China could frame the vessel's movements as \"innocent passage\" under international law but its true purpose was to deliver a pointed message. \nRay Powell, director of the SeaLight programme and a retired US Air Force colonel, said the Chinese vessel's presence was targeted \"to push Philippine government vessels further away from Scarborough Shoal\", which has been regularly guarded by Chinese military and militia ships. \nThe stand-off comes after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr signed the Maricreated_at Zones Act and the Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act in November to bolster Manila's maricreated_at boundaries. \n\"China is trying to wear down the Philippines by repeated intrusions,\" said Carl Thayer, an emeritus professor of politics at the University of New South Wales. \n\"The Philippines should be worried. China is playing the long game in the expectation that continual pressure on the Philippines will result in acquiescence to China's sovereignty claims and a severing of its military alliance with the United States.\" \nCopyright (c) 2025.

Although Beijing has denied involvement, it could be behind the hacking of the US Treasury and two US telecommunications giants (AT&T and Verizon) in December 2024, as some have alleged.\nWe can expect to see more of these tit-for-tat measures between the two powers soon.\nThe uncertainties in the South China Sea will have a bearing on Malaysia's chairmanship of Asean: they had bedevilled earlier chairmen, too.\nAt best, Putrajaya can reduce the tensions by working out a modus vivendi mechanism between Manila and Beijing.\nWith the US having declared itself ready to come to the defence of the Philippines, a treaty ally since 1951, the region is once again poised for volatility.\nWashington's willingness to stand up to China over Taiwan could worsen tensions.\nA few missteps by either side could engulf the region in a conflict, undermining the security architecture Asean has assiduously built over the years.\nOnce broken, it will take years to rebuild signature security arrangements like the Asean Regional Forum, East Asia Summit and Defence Ministers' Meeting Plus. In the meancreated_at, the vacuum is likely to attract other destructive forces.\nAsean can only manage China. It will be futile to confront China in its backyard, a truth that the US should also heed.\nAsean should continue to pursue bilateral talks or dialogues to manage crises and explore cooperative initiatives. While this method has been attempted before without concrete results, the mechanism remains valid.\nIt gives space to contending parties to communicate, express opinions and, when necessary, speak their minds! Acting as a punching bag, informal forums are useful to \"get something off your chest\", as the saying goes.\nEngaging China constructively on the South China Sea requires a blend of diplomacy, practical cooperation, and strategic patience. The goal is to build trust, reduce tensions and seek win-win outcomes without compromising sovereignty.\nAsean countries have been promoting these objectives via economic and political initiatives for years. For example, the Asean security signature project known as the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea has been ongoing since 1998.\nAsean hopes to conclude the talks with China by 2026, when the Philippines assumes chairmanship of the grouping. Even so, it would not cancel out the geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea.\nBetter for Asean to stay out of the squabble between China and the US in the South China Sea.\nOne way to de-escalate is to stop large-scale military drills near contested areas while maintaining presence in domestic waters. Risky air or naval manoeuvres could spark clashes.\nWhile constructive engagement with China requires resilience and pragmatism, Asean must try to balance respective sovereign rights with the higher pursuit of common interests by engaging China constructively and cooperatively through joint resource development.\nThe writer is founding director-general of Maricreated_at Institute of Malaysia\n( END )\n"

    "text": "\nManila, January 7 (ANI): The Philippines has deployed its vessels and aircraft to closely monitor a massive Chinese Coast Guard ship, the largest in the world, spotted near Luzon Island. Filipino officials have expressed concerns over the ship's presence, considering it a menacing move within Philippine waters, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported.\nThe 12,000-ton China Coast Guard vessel 5901, known as \"The Monster\" because of its massive size, was last seen on Saturday about 54 nautical miles from Capones Island, located in the western part of Zambales province in the South China Sea.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) has been closely tracking the Chinese vessel, issuing radio messages demanding its departure from Philippine waters. Jonathan Malaya, assistant director general of the National Security Council, described the move as an act of intimidation, coercion, and aggression against the Philippines. \nHe also stated that the Philippines is monitoring the ship closely, adding that any provocative actions would result in an appropriate response from the government, although he refrained from providing further specifics.\nThe vessel's arrival at Scarborough Shoal last week, a disputed area in the South China Sea within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ), has added to the rising tensions, according to an analyst speaking to Radio Free Asia. Scarborough Shoal, also known as Bajo de Masinloc in the Philippines, has been under Chinese control since 2012, although it is also claimed by China, the Philippines, and Taiwan, reported RFA.\nMalaya dismissed China's claim that the ship was merely patrolling within its jurisdiction. While the Chinese embassy in Manila has yet to respond to inquiries, it has continuously asserted its authority over Scarborough Shoal. The shoal has traditionally been a vital fishing ground for Filipino fishermen, but their access has been increasingly limited by Chinese vessels in recent years.\nDespite the Chinese ship not engaging in aggressive actions so far, Malaya reiterated that its presence in Philippine waters has no legal basis under international law. \"We don't want to be the cause of any provocative actions, so for now, we are simply monitoring and shadowing the ship,\" Malaya explained.\nOn Sunday, the Philippine Coast Guard announced that its vessel, the BRP Cabra, alongside an aircraft, was keeping a close watch on the Chinese ship and challenging it via radio. \nBy Monday evening, the BRP Cabra continued trailing the Chinese vessel for the third consecutive day, as reported by Commodore Jay Tarriela, the PCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea -- the name the Philippines uses for waters within its EEZ in the South China Sea, RFA reported.\nTarriela added that the erratic movements of the Chinese vessel indicated it was likely conducting a \"law enforcement operation\" rather than merely passing through Philippine waters.

    "text": "\n Filipino fishermen should continue their activities in the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) as Philippine naval and air assets are keeping a close watch on the China Coast Guard's 'monster ship,' which was sighted near Lubang Island in Occidental Mindoro yesterday.\nNational Security Council assistant director general Jonathan Malaya issued the call at a briefing yesterday after the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) reported spotting China's 'monster ship,' said to be the world's biggest coast guard vessel, moving from the northern part of Zambales toward Lubang Island.\n'Based on laws, it's Philippine waters and within our exclusive economic zone and therefore (Filipinos) can fish there anycreated_at. Our message to them is they should continue their fishing activities. Nothing has changed even if there's a (foreign) ship there,' Malaya said at the briefing.\n'We have all our assets pointed at this monster ship. At the moment, if it does something bad or in the sense of some provocative action, it will have to deal with appropriate response from the government,' he said.\nThe PCG was able to detect the 165-meter 'monster ship' using Canada's dark vessel detection system.\n'We're continuously doing radio challenge and we're making sure the ship doesn't create trouble inside our EEZ,' the NSC official said.\nHe said China's deployment of large vessels was meant to scare away Filipino fishermen. 'In response, we're stepping up the presence of vessels from BFAR (Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources) and the PCG in the area to support our fishermen,' he said.\nYesterday, PCG spokesman for West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela reported the presence of the 'monster ship' near Occidental Mindoro.\n'This morning, it is 80 nautical miles away from Lubang Island, Occidental Mindoro,' Tarriela said over radio dzBB.\nThere was no report of harassment of Filipino fishermen in the area, he said. The 165-meter CCG ship was first spotted 54 nautical miles from Capones Island, Zambales, which is within the Philippines' 200-nautical-mile EEZ, on Jan. 4.\nIn response, the PCG deployed BRP Cabra, a helicopter and a PCG Caravan aircraft to confirm the sighting and assert the Philippines' territorial rights.\nThe appearance of the CCG's 'monster ship' and other Chinese vessels closer to the Zambales coastline, especially near Panatag Shoal or Bajo de Masinloc, was an alarming development, according to Tarriela.\nHe said their presence 'appears to aim at legitimizing their activities near Bajo de Masinloc and discouraging Filipino fishermen from operating in the area.'\nThe PCG also confirmed the discovery of a Chinese underwater drone off the coast of Masbate, marking the first instance of such a find on the eastern seaboard.\nHe also said the PCG is determined to sustain its effort at challenging the presence of the 'monster ship' in Philippine waters.\nIn a video shared by Tarriela with the media, a man was heard on the radio introducing himself as someone from CCG patrol ship with bow number 5901.\nThe voice from the radio said the ship was performing 'law enforcement duties' in the 'jurisdiction waters of China.' A voice could also be heard saying the 'South China Sea arbitration is illegal and invalid.'\nIt also said China would 'firmly uphold its territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests in the South China Sea.'\nWhile the rest of the audio could not be heard clearly, a voice supposedly of a CCG officer also said China would 'adhere in managing maricreated_at disputes through dialog and cooperation,' in line with 'safeguarding peace and stability in the South China Sea' to 'maintain mutual trust and cooperation between our countries.'\nA female PCG officer - called 'Angel of the Sea' - on board the Cabra, responded to the CCG's challenge and ordered the 'monster ship' to 'depart immediately and notify us of your intentions.'\nThe female officer also warned the CCG that it does not 'possess any legal authority to patrol within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone,' invoking Republic Act 12064 or the Maricreated_at Zones Act, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2016 arbitral award.\nTarriela also shared a video of the CCG 5901 taken from a light Philippine aircraft.\n'This aircraft will document any potential incidents, including intentional ramming by the CCG vessel, and ensure that immediate rescue operations can be initiated if needed,' Tarriela said.\n"

    "text": "\n China's biggest coast guard vessel maintained its 'illegal presence' in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and has ignored requests to leave the area, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said on Monday.\nThe PCG's BRP Cabra continued to shadow the movements of 'The Monster,' China Coast Guard (CCG) 5901, with both vessels asserting each other's territorial claims through radio challenges. As of Monday, the Chinese ship was 148 kilometers (80 nautical miles) away from Lubang Island, Occidental Mindoro.\n'Observations reveal that the CCG vessel's erratic movements indicate it is not engaged in innocent passage but rather asserts that it is conducting a law enforcement operation, claiming jurisdiction over these waters as belonging to the People's Republic of China,' PCG spokesperson for West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela said in a statement.\nThe PCG told the Chinese ship in a patrol on Sunday: 'China Coast Guard 5901, under Republic Act 12064 [or the] Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the 2016 Arbitral Award, you do not possess any legal authority to patrol within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.'\n'You are directed to depart immediately and to notify us of your intentions,' it said.\nIn response, the Chinese ship said it was 'performing law enforcement duties on the jurisdictional waters of the People's Republic of China,' dismissing the 2016 South China Sea arbitration ruling as 'illegal and invalid.'\n'Measured actions'\n'I hope you will safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea and maintain mutual trust and cooperation between our countries with concrete actions,' it said.\nThe PCG deployed BRP Cabra and two aircraft on Saturday after the Chinese ship was spotted 100 km (54 nautical miles) from Capones Island facing the coast of Zambales. The 12,000-ton Monster dwarfed the 330-ton Philippine ship by about 36 created_ats the size of the Cabra.\nTarriela said an Islander aircraft will support the BRP Cabra to document 'any potential incidents, including intentional ramming by the CCG vessel, and ensure that immediate rescue operations can be initiated if needed.'\n'The PCG will continue to take deliberate and appropriately measured actions to challenge the illegal presence of the Chinese coast guard until it ceases its violations of the Philippines' sovereign rights in these waters,' he said.\nAssistant Director General Jonathan Malaya, spokesperson for the National Security Council, called the Monster's presence 'obviously... an act of intimidation, coercion and aggression against the Philippines.'\n'As of now, since our policy is we do not want to take provocative action, what we intend to do is to take the high moral ground at all created_ats [by] shadowing and closely watching its activities,' Malaya said in an interview over government television.\n'We have all our assets pointed at this monster ship at the moment any created_at that it performs any illegal act in the sense such as a provocative action, it will have a corresponding response from the [Philippine] government,' he said.\nHe also dismissed China's claim that it was 'conducting patrols within their area.'\n'No country ever supports that claim, and nothing of this sort is written in international law,' Malaya said.\n'Driving circles'\nAccording to Ray Powell, director of Stanford University's SeaLight project, which tracks South China Sea activities through satellite imaging, the Chinese vessel arrived near Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal on Jan. 1 to boost Beijing's control over the maricreated_at area. Three other CCG ships and seven maricreated_at militia vessels were also at the shoal.\nPanatag Shoal or Bajo de Masinloc lies 222 km (120 nautical miles) from the mainland west of Luzon, well within the country's EEZ. China calls the shoal Huangyan Dao although it is nearly 926 km (500 nautical miles) from the nearest Chinese territory of the island province of Hainan.\nBeijing took hold of the shoal in 2012 after a two-month standoff with the Philippine Navy, prompting Manila to file a case against China before an international arbitral tribunal the following year.\nThe court ruled in 2016 that Beijing's so-called nine-dash-line claim had no basis in international law, but China rejected the ruling.\nAs of Monday, Powell said the BRP Cabra was 'driving circles' around The Monster at 5 to 9 knots while the Chinese ship was 'lumbering at 2 to 5 knots' some 101 to 130 km (55 to 70 nautical miles) from the Luzon coast.\n"

    "text": "\nA Philippine senator on Monday filed a resolution seeking a probe into an underwater drone with Chinese markings recovered in the waters of San Pascual, Masbate province on Dec. 30, citing risks to national security and concerns over espionage.\nIn Senate Resolution No. 1267, Senate Majority Floor Leader Francis N. Tolentino called on the Senate to look into the six-foot drone, saying its presence raises “critical concerns” on Manila’s territorial integrity and national security.\n“It is crucial to ascertain whether the drone’s presence constitutes a violation of Philippine laws, considering its discovery inside our archipelagic waters over which the Philippine has sovereignty,” according to a copy of the resolution.\nThe drone is likely a Chinese underwater navigation and communication system, the lawmaker said, citing initial investigation by the Philippine National Police.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately reply to a Viber message seeking comment.\nIn a statement on Jan. 3 Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) spokesman Xerxes A. Trinidad said police had turned over the remotely operated submersible drone to the military for further investigation.\nChina and the Philippines have been at loggerheads over disputed features in the South China Sea, with Manila accusing China’s coast guard of aggression and Beijing furious over what it calls repeated provocations and territorial incursions.\nBeijing asserts its claim of sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea through an armada of coast guard ships, some of which are accused by its neighbors of aggressive conduct and of trying to disrupt energy and fishery activity in their exclusive economic zones (EEZ).\nBrunei, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines and Vietnam all claim parts of the sea.\nEEZs extend 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) from a country’s coast and give it sovereign rights to explore and exploit the natural resources in the water and on the ocean floor.\nThe United Nations-backed Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in 2016 voided China’s claim over the waterway for being illegal. Beijing has ignored the ruling.\n“There is an urgency in determining the drone’s origins and its compliance with Philippine maricreated_at laws as its presence raises critical concerns regarding its origin and implications on our country’s territorial and national security,” Mr. Tolentino said.\nCiting the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, which President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. signed into law in November, the senator said foreign vessels do not have navigational rights in Philippine waters unless authorized by the government.\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry in December urged the Philippines to return to “peaceful development” amid Manila’s plan to acquire the US’ mid- range Typhon missile system, which Beijing said could fuel an arms race in the region.\nPhilippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Gerardo C. Teodoro, Jr. earlier said Manila would not become a “doorstep” and that acquiring the missile system was within the country’s prerogative to enhance its defense capabilities.\nThe missile system is a land-based, ground-launched system that can fire the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile, according to the US Army Pacific.\nIt also has a battery operation center, four launchers, prime movers and modified trailers. China and Russia have criticized the move to keep the system in the Philippines, saying it could fuel an arms race in the region.\n“If proven that the discovered submersible drone was used by a foreign state to conduct underwent surveillance, be it for military or as part marine scientific research without the consent of the Republic of the Philippines, the same constitutes a violation of our sovereignty,” Mr. Tolentino said in the Senate resolution.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-07",
    "text": "\nMalaysia has taken over as Chair of ASEAN for 2025. The theme, Inclusivity and Sustainability enmeshed within the declaration of ASEAN 2025: Forging Ahead Together\", has been enunciated as the pathway for greater political-security, economic, and socio-cultural cooperation.\nWhile this is the fifth created_at when Malaysia is donning this role, this innings will be even more complex, requiring the best of negotiating and manoeuvring capabilities. It's chairmanship must navigate through rising geopolitical tensions, US-China trade war, the seemingly intractable crisis in Myanmar as well as the tardy progress on a binding Code of Conduct for the South China Sea. To ensure resilience, ASEAN centrality must itself adapt and recalibrate to cope with the transforming realities.\nBeing a founding member of the bloc, Malaysia's appointment as chair had been eagerly awaited in hopes of strengthening ASEAN's cohesiveness and guiding it away from the constraints of great power rivalry, potentially further complicated by the soon-approaching second Trump administration in the US.\nAmong Malaysia's key priorities for 2025 will be to bring peace in Myanmar, reduce disruptions in supply chains, and expand the dimensions of prosperity, before the rotating chair's position transitions to the Philippines.\nThe key strategic thrusts as had been spelt out by the Malaysian Minister of Trade and Industry (MITI)Minister Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz, during an address at the ASEAN Business Club in June 2024. are: \"a. Enhancing Trade and Investment between ASEAN Member States; b. Integrating and Connecting Economies; c. Forging an Inclusive and Sustainable Future; and d. Transforming for the Digital Future.\"\nSimilar aspirations for ASEAN were shared by visiting Ambassador Raja Dato' Nushirwan Zainal Abidin, Director General of the National Security Council of Malaysia at a meeting organised by the Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) in New Delhi on January 6, 2025.\nIndia's concerns about ASEAN coherence and centrality stem from the rising influence of China, which directly impinges on India's security responses. Ambassador Abidin, while responding to difficult questions concerning China's aggressiveness in the South China Sea and options available for ASEAN, underlined that bilateral issues must be resolved between the disputant states. It is well known that the 1.4 square miles of the SCS are the most contested waters in the world; yet each member state is expected to independently manage the China challenge.\nAmbassador Abidin very candidly shared, \"We (i.e. Malaysia) do not recognise the claims made by China and hence issues of joint development of features in the SCS do not arise. Hence, the SCS dispute does not occupy more than 5 percent of the total bandwidth of our relations with China.\"\nEvidently then, regional cooperation must be endeavoured on issues which are relevant for all member states. That China-ASEAN trade has multiplied manifold, reaching almost USD 1 trillion in 2025, undergirded by soft and hard connectivity, implies that economic ties are so deep and all-encompassing that the issues of the South China Sea must be relegated to that of a non-issue. In fact, Malaysia will host the inaugural summit of the ASEAN-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Plus China, in May 2025. This will provide greater momentum for China to expand its relations with the GCC (through ASEAN) across multiple sectors. With 23 percent of voting rights vested with the Chinese diaspora in Malaysia, Chinese interests are secured.\nAnother key priority for the Chair in 2025 is to salvage Myanmar, a country that continues to be gripped by violence and instability since February 2021, from becoming a failed state. The amplification of prioritising peace in Myanmar in 2025, has resulted in Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra being appointed as an informal advisor to Malaysian Prime Minister for 2025. Malaysia's Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan providing a justification for Thaksin's role, asserted, \"His role (as an advisor) is informal. Thaksin is influential in Thailand, is accepted by the US, and has a close relationship with China. This positions him as a bridge for ASEAN (to foster stronger ties)\". As was expected, Thailand was quick to host two critical ASEAN meetings in December 2024 on Myanmar. Several more meetings must be in the pipeline, given the number of stakeholders involved. China must be at the table too!\nGiven that Malaysia has a recognised track record of brokering peace, it's chairmanship is being viewed as fortuitous to guide ASEAN in promoting solutions that prioritize diplomacy, collective resolve, and regional cooperation given its history as a peace mediator. Malaysia has been complimented by leaders in both Thailand and the Philippines for its role as a mediator for peace in southern Thailand and in Mindanao in southern Philippines, respectively.Marcos Jr had complimented Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim, when he said \"We have recognized the great contribution that Malaysia has made to the peace process in the southern Philippines. We hope that this support that they have shown over the past few years will continue and will contribute to the success of the peace process and the establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.\"\nThailand's Prime Minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra daughter of former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, also expressed gratitude to Malaysia for offering opportunities for the Thai community in the southern border provinces to participate in the training and capacity-building courses under the Malaysia Technical Cooperation Program.\nA week into 2025 and the writing on the wall is clear: Big powers will be courted, even as the US-China trade war brings economic dividends to ASEAN states. However, Malaysia will downplay divergences and maricreated_at disputes in the SCS, as an arms race would negate efforts for inclusivity and sustainability. An imperative is to uphold ASEAN centrality.\nAfter all, the ASEAN 2025 logo symbolises this ethos-the inward-curving petals of the bunga raya (hibiscus flower) emtext a call for member states (and dialogue partners) to turn inward toward regionalism and unity.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-07",
    "text": "\nA Philippine lawmaker's call for an additional US military site to help counter foreign intrusions and potential resource exploitation following the recovery of a submarine drone allegedly from China has drawn mixed reactions from analysts and politicians. \nCongressman Robert Ace Barbers from Surigao del Norte on the southern island of Mindanao said that having a naval base under the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) in the south, particularly in his province, was crucial for protecting the country's eastern seaboard, which is rich in deuterium deposits. \nDeuterium, a type of hydrogen, is used in fusion reactors and has various military, industrial and scientific uses.  \nBarbers had warned in a statement last week that foreign actors might be conducting intelligence operations targeting deuterium and other mineral resources in Philippine waters. \nHe was referring to a yellow drone, marked \"HY-119\", retrieved by Filipino fishermen from the waters off the province of Masbate in the central Philippines. \n\"It is not far-fetched that China has long been conducting in-depth intel gathering inside Philippine waters, possibly including data about deuterium,\" Barbers said. \nBrigadier General Andre Dizon, the Masbate police commander, earlier said the drone - suspected of being of Chinese origin - was used to communicate with satellites and other surface units and was capable of sending and receiving data and voice messages. The Philippine navy was investigating the origin and purpose of the drone. \nJose Antonio Custodio, a fellow at the Consortium of Indo-Pacific Researchers, said Barbers' proposal was feasible given that US troops had been stationed on Mindanao in the southern Philippines for 20 years for the war on terrorism.  \nCustodio said having another EDCA site would be beneficial to Manila as the Americans could help monitor certain areas, such as the Surigao Strait's exit into the Pacific Ocean. \n\"You can shut it off from the Chinese or to any hostile presence by establishing the capability to monitor and protect that particular strait,\" Custodio said. \n\"The role of the Philippines is like a cork plugging a bottle. So, we are basically the barrier against China expanding into the Pacific. You shut it off from the Chinese to contain them to operate only in the South China Sea.\" \nBarbers' brother, Surigao del Norte Governor Lyndon Barbers, has been advocating for an EDCA site to be built on the country's southeastern side due to the potential for intrusions such as the drone incident. \nSeparately, Robert Ace Barbers also responded to the proposal by the Department of National Defence and the navy to develop a naval facility within the 3,000-hectare Phividec Industrial Authority complex in Misamis Oriental to support the nearby Lumbia airbase located in Cagayan de Oro City in Mindanao. \n\"While I do not question the logic and wisdom behind the plan to put up an EDCA naval site inside the Phividec facility, I think it would be prudent for us not to intermix the business complex with a military complex,\" Barbers said.  \nVincent Kyle Parada, a former defence analyst for the Philippine Navy, said when Manila adopted the new Comprehensive Archipelagic Defence Concept (CADC), it was intended to cover beyond the West Philippine Sea to include vital areas in the eastern seaboard such as Benham Rise and the rest of the Philippine Sea. \nThe CADC is Manila's new strategy designed to protect the country's exclusive economic zone, which is located in what it calls the West Philippine Sea. \n\"Strategic basing is a key component of CADC, so in that sense, a naval facility in Surigao del Norte would be aligned with the defence establishment's ongoing efforts,\" Parada said. \n\"I think the ball is really in Washington's court if they want to further expand EDCA moving forward. If we take a look at the current sites, most are located in areas facing Taiwan and the South China Sea. Those are the key strategic interests for the US as far as its relationship with the Philippines is concerned.\" \nWhile a new facility might benefit the Philippines, Parada said that convincing the US could be a challenge. \nDefence expert Joshua Espena said adding another defence point on the eastern seaboard was crucial for Manila's Active Archipelagic Defence Concept, especially to deal with purported foreign threats such as the drone incident. \nGiven widespread political support for President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr's government to deepen the alliance with the US, Espena described Barbers' proposal as feasible. \nThe move towards closer military ties with the US, however, has drawn opposition from some quarters, including former president Rodrigo Duterte and his daughter Vice-President Sara Duterte-Carpio.  \nCarlos Isagani Zarate, a former member of the House of Representatives and the Bayan Muna party who is an opponent of EDCA sites, has dismissed Barbers' proposal. \n\"The EDCA sites undermine our country's sovereignty. The presence of foreign troops and facilities could escalate regional tensions and drag the Philippines into conflicts that are not our own,\" he warned.\n"

    "text": "\n Malacañang on Tuesday expressed 'grave concern' over the presence of China's so-called monster ship off the coast of Zambales, adding that the Philippines is actively challenging its presence.\n'We view it with concern, so far we have been challenging the presence of that monster ship,' Executive Lucas Bersamin said in a press conference.\nAccording to Bersamin, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) has been 'very alert' since the appearance of the Chinese ship.\n'It keeps appearing, and it is within our exclusive economic zone, so it is being challenged,' Bersamin said in a mix of English and Filipino. 'There were many occasions when our coast guard vessels challenged theirs. China also issues counter-challenges, but it all works out in the end, and nothing confrontational happens.'\n'The issue here may be projection, but I'm not going to say anything more because that is a matter of operations,' he added.\nHe reiterated that the Philippine government consistently issues diplomatic protests against China for its aggressive actions in the West Philippine Sea. He also noted the existence of a permanent mechanism for discussions between Manila and Beijing-specifically the vice ministerial-level conference-aimed at the peaceful settlement of disputes in the West Philippine Sea.\nThe so-called 'monster ship,' Chinese Coast Guard Vessel 5901, was detected 100 kilometers (54 nautical miles) from Capones Island using Canada's Dark Vessel Detection system.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), in response, deployed its BRP Cabra (MRRV-4409) to shadow the ship and assert the country's presence in the area.\nThese developments occurred amid a long-created_at territorial dispute after China, through its so-called 10-dash line, claimed ownership of most of the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea, which is well within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nChina's 10-dash claims were effectively invalidated by a July 2016 international tribunal ruling that stemmed from a case filed by Manila in 2013, but the Asian giant has continued to ignore the ruling and persistently encroaches on the Philippines' EEZ.\n"

    "text": "\n Vice President Kamala Harris plans to close out her term with an around-the-world trip making stops in Singapore, Bahrain and Germany, her office said.\nThe trip, which is scheduled to last from Jan. 13 to Jan. 17, will be a final opportunity for Harris to address U.S. foreign policy challenges before Donald Trump takes office. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff is expected to join the vice president. \nAlthough she has not disclosed her next steps after losing the presidential election, the expansive travel suggests that Harris might want to continue playing a role on the global stage. There's also speculation that Harris could run for governor of her home state of California.\nDean Lieberman, Harris' deputy national security adviser, said in a written statement that \"the vice president felt it important to spend some of her final days in office thanking and engaging directly with U.S. servicemembers deployed overseas, which as she has said, has been one of her greatest privileges as vice president.\"\nThere are U.S. troops based at all three of Harris' stops.\nHarris plans to visit Changi Naval Base in Singapore and meet with leaders of the city-state. Singapore's location in the Indo-Pacific region makes it a key partner for addressing issues involving China, including freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. \nThe next stop is Bahrain, where Harris will visit the headquarters of the U.S. 5th Fleet, which operates in the Persian Gulf. The fleet has been engaged in efforts to protect Israel from Iranian attacks and regional shipping activity from the Houthis in Yemen. \nHarris' final stop will be Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany, home to a deployment of U.S. Air Force fighter jets. She plans to talk about the importance of NATO in deterring Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago. \nHarris has previously visited Germany and Singapore. Bahrain will be the 22nd country she's visited during her term. \n\"The vice president continues to believe in a strong U.S. global leadership role because it benefits the security and prosperity of the American people, and she will reaffirm this throughout her trip,\" Lieberman said.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines mobilised its air and sea assets in its economic exclusive zone after accusing China of intimidation with the deployment of a \"monster\" Chinese coast guard vessel.\nManila raised an alarm over China's deployment of the 12,000-ton patrol vessel, CCG-5901, which was first spotted off the coast of Capones Island in the western province of Zambales on Saturday.\nWith a length of 541ft, the CCG-5901 is three created_ats the size of the US coast guard's main patrol vessels, the National Security Cutter, and is armed with anti-aircraft guns and fuel storage capacities making it suitable it to undertake extended missions.\nPhilippine coast guard spokesman Jay Tarriela said its patrol vessel BRP Cabra is \"maintaining its vigilant monitoring of the illegal presence of the China coast guard vessel CCG-5901 within the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for the third consecutive day\".\nIts \"erratic movements indicate it is not engaged in innocent passage but rather asserts that it is conducting a law enforcement operation, claiming jurisdiction over these waters as belonging to the People's Republic of China\".\nJonathan Malaya, spokesperson for the National Security Council, told state television on Monday: \"We have all our assets pointed at this monster ship. The moment it (carries out) any provocative action, it will be met with appropriate response\".\nPhilippine Coast Guard Continues Vigilant Monitoring of Illegal Presence of China Coast Guard Vessel\nAs of 1900H today, the Philippine Coast Guard vessel, BRP Cabra (MRRV-4409), is maintaining its vigilant monitoring of the illegal presence of the China Coast Guard vessel... pic.twitter.com/V9nhZeOnZv\n- Jay Tarriela (@jaytaryela)\nJanuary 6, 2025\nAccording to a video shared by the Philippine coast guard, it ordered the Chinese vessel to leave the area, warning it has no authority to operate there.

They are showcasing their ship to intimidate our fishermen,\" Mr Malaya said, adding the Philippine maricreated_at presence would be boosted to support fishermen.\nThe situation between China and US ally Philippines marks the latest point of friction as the relations between the two have soured in the past few years, with spats frequent as Manila, under president Ferdinand Marcos Jr, pushes back at what it sees as aggression by Beijing.\nChina has accused the Philippines of repeated encroachment in its waters.\nChina with its largest navy in the world claims most of the South China Sea, a key conduit for $3 trillion of annual ship-borne trade, as its own territory, with a massive coast guard presence in and around the EEZs of neighbours Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia.\nThe state-run Global created_ats reported on Monday that the Chinese coast guard would increase patrols around the disputed Scarborough Shoal. It said the law enforcement patrols are \"entirely justified\".\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Tuesday: \"It is beyond reproach for China coast guard to patrol and conduct law-enforcement activities in relevant waters in accordance with the law\".\nThe Chinese foreign ministry is yet to respond to Philippines' comments.\n"

    "text": "\nHong Kong, January 7 (ANI): China continued to encounter turbulence throughout 2024. However, all the difficulties that China is facing at home and abroad have made Chairman Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) more determined to throw their weight around and irrepressibly bully those who disagree with it. In the coming year, it appears greater tumult lies ahead for both China and those who deal with it.\nOne critical area to watch in the coming year will be Sino-US relations after Donald Trump begins his second presidential term. Since Trump's election on November 5, 2024, and even before he is inaugurated on 20 January, China has pulled off many outrageous feats and set preconditions for ongoing bilateral ties. For example, Beijing has hacked the US Treasury Department and executed the \"worst telecom hack in US history\". China has also imposed severe export controls and sanctioned American firms.\nLyle Morris, Senior Fellow for Foreign Policy and National Security at the US-based Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, made four predictions regarding Sino-US relations in 2025. Firstly, \"China will focus its rhetoric on areas of potential cooperation with Washington, which will include attempts to establish a 'fresh start' with the newly elected US president. However, Beijing will likely adopt more aggressive language over US actions that it regards as harming its core interests, including Taiwan and the South China Sea.\"\nSecondly, the American academic foretold, \"The United States will reach a consensus that China is its biggest strategic competitor, and China will continue to dominate the trade and national security agenda in Washington.\" Of course, Trump may act unpredictably, so their fragile relationship risks further destabilization.\nThird, \"Forging discrete areas of cooperation will remain key to arresting acute strategic competition,\" predicted Morris. \"Even though the chances of a genuine thaw that resolves fundamental differences and leads to greater cooperation are low in 2025, recent agreements to enhance military-to-military communications and working groups to combat the illicit fentanyl trade are examples of the kinds of cooperation that can build positive momentum.\"\nFinally, Lyle predicted, \"Diplomatic engagement will remain a key source of structural stability in the bilateral relationship, and active diplomacy by both sides can keep ties from further fraying in 2025.\" However, questions remain over China's commitment to keeping communication channels open. The socialist regime has very thin skin, and it tends to pout and give the cold shoulder when it feels offended.\nConsider also that Xi has had plenty of created_at to plan ahead on how to handle the USA under Trump a second created_at around. In Trump's first presidency, China scrambled for appropriate responses, but now Xi is more ready and will likely employ retaliation, adaptation and diversification at various points of their relationship. China's economy is arguably more self-reliant now, whilst the US economy is more fragile and its political spectrum is deeply divided. China is already tightening the screws on private Western and American companies operating in China, and Xi may use Elon Musk's financial interests there to exert influence on Trump too.\nFurthermore, China will doubtlessly be hoping that Trump's erratic behavior will alienate friendly nations and acquaintances in Asia and elsewhere around the world.\nBeijing will seek every opportunity to present its alternative worldview, and it is now better equipped to respond to Trump's mercantile gamesmanship.\nXi continues to remonstrate with the Chinese people to \"struggle\" against the \"dangerous storms\" lashing it. And struggle is what the Chinese government and military did against all-comers last year. Its prime target has been Taiwan, but it continues to contest Japanese-owned islands in the East China Sea as well. To illustrate, the number of Chinese government vessels spotted by the Japan Coast\nGuard in the Senkaku Islands contiguous zone hit 1,351 vessels, covering 355 out of 366 days, in 2024. This was the third record year in a row. China has upped the ante of incursions and is using larger vessels too.\nChinese ships are also accused of sabotaging undersea cables in both Europe and Asia. In the latest incident, on 3 January the cargo ship Shunxing39 is believed to have damaged a seabed communications cable - part of the Trans-Pacific Express Cable System that connects Taiwan's internet with the US west coast - after dragging its anchor and charting a crisscrossing course north of Taiwan for several days. The ship is registered to a Hong Kong company, whose director is from China. Such sabotage is common by Russia in places like the Baltic Sea, and China seems to be using the same playbook.\nCutting such underwater cables is the ultimate gray-zone activity, for civilian-flagged vessels can claim it was accidental. Therefore, as China exerts evermore pressure on Taiwan, we might expect Beijing to repeat such a modus operandi to further isolate and antagonize Taipei, as well as use intensified military incursions and multiple forms of coercion against the democratic state.\nAs well as the above actions during the intervening period between Trump's election and swearing-in ceremony, China's military has been very active. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted the largest naval drills in decades, specifically rehearsing how to cut off Taiwan and intercept American military assets from reinforcing the island. The PLA also practiced a naval blockade near Japanese islands for the first created_at, as well as continuing to agitate in the South China Sea with its maricreated_at militia and law enforcement fleets.\nThe Philippines has borne the brunt of China's wrath in the South China Sea. As soon as Manila began asserting its legal rights in the maricreated_at area and complained against Chinese encroachment, Beijing removed the velvet glove from its iron fist. There have been repeated clashes in various locations, including Philippine efforts to resupply its garrison at Second Thomas Shoal well within its own exclusive economic zone.\nCommodore Jay Tarriela, Chief of Coast Guard Staff for Human Resource Management of the Philippine Coast Guard, has highlighted numerous nefarious\nactivities by China. He noted, for example, \"It's clear that the Chinese Coast Guard is engaging in automatic identification system (AIS) spoofing to mislead the international community, confuse authorities and instigate public concern. It's particularly ironic that maricreated_at safety, a fundamental responsibility of any coast guard organization, is compromised by China's disregard for the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, especially the mandatory AIS requirements outlined in Chapter V for certain vessels.\" Tarriela accused China of exploiting AIS signals of other vessels for their spoofing activities, and said it is likely utilizing dredgers to help facilitate this AIS manipulation.\nTechnologically, the PLA is advancing at a rapid drumbeat, showing and introducing equipment in classes not even the USA is currently fielding. For example, China recently launched its first Type 076 amphibious vessel, the largest of its kind in the world, and one that can accommodate fighter jets on its flight deck. Add to that the stunning achievement of successfully staging the maiden flights of no fewer than two sixth-generation aircraft types plus a new airborne early warning variant of the Y-20 aircraft on December 26, 2024, and it can be seen that Chinese confidence and technological knowhow is soaring.\nNot nearly so much is heard of Xi's blue-ribbon Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Launched in 2013, BRI is now more than a decade old but it is in decline after peaking in 2018. Instead, China has transferred its attention to three vague initiatives launched in 2021-22: the Global Data Security Initiative, Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative. All this - as well as Chinese and Russian efforts to promote the BRICS grouping and to attract new members - are designed to exert greater influence over the Global South and to contribute to either the perception or reality of a US decline.\nIndeed, Xi remains a stalwart support of Vladimir Putin, despite his military failures in his Ukraine war. Beijing pretends to be neutral, but most thinking people realize China is anything but impartial. It remains firmly on Moscow's side. As Hua Chunying, China's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, said soon after the Russian invasion, \"China stands ready to join hands with Russia and all other progressive forces around the world who oppose hegemony and power politics, to reject any unilateralism, protectionism and bullying, firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests and uphold international fairness and justice.\"\nSuch comments are laughable. Like in George Orwell's dystopian vision of the future, the CCP has stripped language of meaning. The Chinese regime twists and eradicates ideas opposed to its own version of reality, and so phrases like \"progressive forces\" and \"upholding international fairness and justice\" have no meaning in China. Reality and truth are the real enemies to regimes like the CCP.\nHua also went on to say: \"We Chinese value peace, harmony, sincerity and integrity. We never pick a fight or bully others, but we have principles and guts.\" Again, such statements about \"peace and harmony\" are completely at odds with China's aggressive behavior. Still, not everyone in the world recognizes the odious ideologies and aims that lie behind China's thinly veiled veneer of uprightness. \nHuman rights are almost nonexistent in China, and yet Beijing is promoting such policies and vision to the rest of the world. Unfortunately, international attention on China's detention centers for Uyghurs in Xinjiang has waned, but China's trampling of human rights has not disappeared. Indeed, as at the end of 2024, there were at least 218 \"custody centers\" dotted around China to support China's liuzhi (literally \"retention in custody\") policy. This detention system was established under China's National Supervisory Commission set up in 2018.\nA recent report published by the CNN believes the number of detention centers is much higher than that. Additionally, provinces with higher numbers of ethnic minorities have greater concentrations of detention centers. Furthermore, the CNN investigation found at least 127 senior executives of publicly listed firms have been imprisoned. Such detainees caught up in Xi's anti-graft crackdown can be held for six months without seeing a lawyer or family members, plus the system is prone to abuse in terms of torture and ill treatment.\nHong Kong, as far as China is concerned, is a success story. The territory's police apparatus, a blunt political tool in the CCP's hands, has stifled all dissent and every form of public protest. Ongoing prosecutions for spurious crimes such as wearing T-\nshirts with slogans are more than enough to remind the populace to toe the line and to avoid complaining about the CCP's lackeys in charge there. Since around 2020, thousands deserted Hong Kong, unwilling to live in such a police state. Indeed, from 2020-22, the territory's labor force declined by 1,40,000. \nNonetheless, the Hong Kong government is happily replacing these emigres with people from mainland China. Interestingly, the territory's population increased 2.1 per cent from mid-2022 to mid-2023, mostly due to immigration from China. Around a third of Hong Kong's current population has actually originated from China, indicating the great demographic shift that has occurred there.\nHowever, corruption and political schisms continue to afflict the CCP, adding to Xi's paranoia over job security. The year 2023 was a bad one already, as Foreign Minister Qin Gang and Defense Minister Li Shangfu bit the dust. Also to fall victim were the top two commanders of the PLA Rocket Force. Yet, 2024's anti-graft campaign netted even more high-profile military leaders, a 25 per cent jump in fact. A record number of 56\nsenior cadres at the vice-ministerial level or above were investigated in 2024.\nDoes this mean that Xi would therefore be cautious about sending the PLA into a conflict, because he lacks full confidence in the purity of the military? Euan Graham, a Senior Analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, noted, \"Corruption is endemic to CCP governance. Even deeply corrupt militaries (Ukraine) can fight very well, while combat itself is a sort of reform (Russia).\"\nUnfortunately, more tensions, more confrontations and greater unpredictability are on the cards for 2025. This is the great vision, the \"community of common destiny\", that Xi and China are offering the world. (ANI)\nRepresentative Image (Image: X@MoNDefense ) - Image\n"

According to news reporting originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In the context of the global energy transition, optimizing deep-water oil and gas drilling parameters is crucial for ensuring safety while improving efficiency. Traditional methods face limitations in highly dynamic and nonlinear drilling environments, struggling to balance speed and cost-effectiveness.\" \n Funders for this research include National Key Research & Development Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). \n Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the China University of Petroleum, \"Furthermore, these methods rely on real-created_at logging-while-drilling (LWD) data for decision-making, but delays in data collection and processing hinder created_atly adjustments of drilling parameters, affecting decision accuracy and responsiveness. This paper proposes a multi-objective drilling parameter optimization framework, incorporating symbolic regression, created_at- series networks, and Markov decision processes to precisely predict ROP, formation conditions, and optimize drilling parameters in real created_at. Key innovations include a multi-population evolutionary symbolic regression algorithm for constructing empirical equations, the integration of variational mode decomposition (VMD) and sample entropy for data preprocessing, and multi-head self-attention created_at-series networks to enhance prediction accuracy. Quantile regression further estimates the range of drilling parameter adjustments. Additionally, a drilling parameter optimization deep deterministic policy gradient (DPODDPG) algorithm was developed to automate real-created_at parameter adjustments. Empirical analysis on the Ledong 10-1 block in the South China Sea demonstrated significant improvements: ROP increased from 54.18 m/hr to 122.17 m/hr, mechanical specific energy (MSE) decreased from 100.82 MPa to 97.78 MPa, and cost per foot reduced from 121.16 x 102 CNY/m to 51.31 x 102 CNY/m. Compared to traditional methods, the proposed framework showed clear advantages in enhancing ROP, reducing MSE, and controlling costs, further validating its superiority in complex drilling environments.\" \n According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This method not only significantly improves drilling efficiency and economic benefits but also adapts to complex and changing drilling conditions, showing broad application potential, particularly in challenging deep-water oil and gas drilling operations, where it can provide more efficient and reliable optimization solutions.\" \n This research has been peer-reviewed. \n For more information on this research see: A Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning Framework for Real-created_at Drilling Optimization Based On Symbolic Regression and Perception.

According to news reporting from Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The progress in petroleum geochemical investigations requires continuously more innovative and accurate tools for the characterization of petroleum geochemical aspects such the source input, depositional environment, type of oils as well as the oil maturation level. Studies previously highlighted the importance of the oil maturity level in the variation of the carbon isotope compositions of individual aromatic compounds but no research has clearly proposed a practical use of these isotopic variations for oil maturation indication.\" \n Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), National Key R & D Program of China, Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China Uni-versity of Petroleum, Beijing. \n The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Northeast Petroleum University, \"Through a successful separation of oil aromatic fractions into sub-fractions, the present research focused on the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) analyses of selected alkylnaphthalenes and alkylphenanthrenes from aromatic fractions of Tarim Basin (NW China), Termit Basin (Niger), Bongor Basin (Chad), and Fushan Depression (South China Sea) crude oils to investigate and fill this knowledge gap. The results showed that the carbon isotope trends of individual aromatic compounds in crude oils with increase of the methylation and the number of aromatic rings is an innovative tool for characterizing crude oil maturation stage. In combination with the calculated vitrinite reflectance values (RC-TNR-2), the carbon isotope trends of individual aromatic compounds (1,2,6-TMN, 1,2,5-TMN, 1,3,6,7-TeMN, 9-MP and 1-MP, from bottom to up, respectively) so called 'aromatic isotopic maturation indicator' enabled the characterization of two distinct maturation stages. The depletion trend corresponding to a higher value of 1,2,6-TMN relative to 1-MP and an enrichment trend indicating a lower value of 1,2,6-TMN compared to 1-MP. Our investigation revealed that the depletion trend indicates a high maturation stage (R-C-TNR-2 > 2 %), suggesting that the studied oils have already reached the cracking stage (Tarim), while the enrichment trend corresponding to lower maturation stage (R-C-TNR-2 < 2 %) indicates that the oil samples have not yet reached the oil cracking stage (Termit, Bongor and Fushan).\" \n According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The findings of this study provide additional insights into the main factors driving variations in oil composition within diverse geological settings and reveal that the key step of a successful use of the aromatic isotopic composition trends as crude oils' thermal maturity indicator begins with a careful selection of the maturity-controlled aromatic compounds as achieved in this study.\" \n This research has been peer-reviewed. \n For more information on this research see: Stable Carbon Isotope Compositions of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: New Indicator of Crude Oil Maturation Stage.

We are the largest investors in each other's economies,\" Blinken said. Japanese firms invested almost $800 billion in the United States in 2023.\nBlinken made no mention of Biden's decision last week to block Nippon Steel's $14.9-billion takeover of long-struggling US Steel, citing national security concerns.\nThe two companies filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Biden administration's \"illegal interference\" in the transaction.\n- More protectionism -\n\"We're certain the lawsuit will reveal a set of facts that clearly violate the constitution and the law, so I believe we have a chance of winning,\" Nippon Steel chair Eiji Hashimoto said on Tuesday.\nTrump, who takes office on January 20, \"wants to make manufacturing strong again\", Hashimoto added.\n\"This is exactly in line with what we're doing,\" he said.\nNippon Steel had touted the takeover as a lifeline for a US company long past its heyday but opponents warned that the Japanese owners would slash jobs.\nUS Steel and Nippon Steel argued in their suit that Biden had blocked the deal for political reasons by ignoring the rule of law to gain favour with workers' unions.\nProtectionism is expected only to intensify under Trump, who in his first term exited a nascent Pacific-wide trade pact and has vowed to use tariffs to protect US industry.\nThe president-elect made clear on Monday he would not reverse the Nippon Steel decision.\n\"Why would they want to sell U.S. Steel now when tariffs will make it a much more profitable and valuable company?\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\"Wouldn't it be nice to have U.S. Steel, once the greatest company in the world, lead the charge toward greatness again?\"\n- Investment concerns -\nForeign Minister Takeshi Iwaya raised the Nippon Steel case with Blinken and stressed the importance of Japanese investment in the United States, Tokyo's foreign ministry said.\nIshiba said Monday that the United States should \"explain clearly\" the security worries cited by Biden.\n\"There are concerns being raised within Japan's industrial world over future Japan-US investment,\" Ishiba warned in unusually outspoken comments.\nYasuhide Yajima, chief economist at NLI Research Institute, told AFP that Biden's decision would \"certainly create a hurdle for Japanese firms, especially manufacturers, to do business over there\".\nBlinken, however, focused on areas of cooperation.\nAfter a sushi breakfast at a famous fish market, he held a working lunch with Iwaya and discussed North Korea's latest missile test, carried out Monday as Blinken visited Seoul.\nBlinken also spoke with Japanese leaders about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and tensions over Taiwan and China's \"dangerous and destabilising behaviour\" in the South China Sea, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.\nIn a key goal for his trip, Blinken voiced confidence that South Korea and Japan would preserve cooperation, including intelligence-sharing on North Korea.\nSouth Korea's conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol has pushed to turn the page on historical tension with Japan, but he was impeached after stunning the nation with a failed attempt to impose martial law last month.\nsct-hih-tmo/kaf/pbt\nNIPPON STEEL & SUMITOMO METAL CORPORATION\nUNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION\n"

But there is another movement, rarely heard in the halls of power, of people who want more dialogue and less escalation.\nThese peace activists, think tanks, arms control experts, professors, researchers and former diplomats describe tensions as the highest they’ve ever been, and so bad that conflict could erupt at any point in the near future. And they see the strategy of deterrence, espoused by China hawks in key roles under both Trump and President Biden, as creating a tinderbox amid global instability, while ignoring efforts to defuse tensions.\nThey say Biden’s military buildup efforts have eroded some diplomatic progress made through high-level talks: two meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and the reestablishment of military-to-military channels. And they have deep anxiety about Trump, given his aggressive trade stance to China and hawkish Cabinet selections.\nLyle Goldstein, a visiting professor at Brown University’s Costs of War Project who studies the U.S.-China relationship, said the cost of a war with China is “incalculable” and would at the very least sow mass destruction in Taiwan and the South China Sea region.\n“You have two superpowers going at it with immense resources,” he said. “The losses could be horrific.”\nBut even if the U.S. were to avoid conflict with China over Taiwan, it is on track to spend trillions of dollars trying to deter Beijing, Goldstein said.\n“We are unfortunately kind of spiraling toward a military conflict. I’m trying my darndest, I’m being very candid, to halt this slide toward conflict,” he said. “Because, to be clear, it’s a catastrophe. And it’s unnecessary.”\nHe said the U.S. should avoid a war over Taiwan, arguing it amounts to a civil war dispute and, for the U.S., a moral conundrum more than a national security risk. He compared it to Afghanistan, where the U.S. spent 20 years and more than $2 trillion in a failed bid to shape the country.\nGoldstein said Washington and Beijing should engage in annual summits, and the U.S. should rethink its One China policy.\nTrump’s wild card\nTrump has been far more ambiguous toward Taiwan than Biden, who repeatedly committed U.S. troops to protect the island should China invade. But Trump’s threats of a trade war with Beijing carry their own risks of ramped-up tensions. \nAnd Trump has selected China hawks for top posts, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) as secretary of State and Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) as national security adviser. Still, he also is close with billionaire Elon Musk, who has business interests in China.\nBut Trump, apart from a strike on Iran’s top general during his first term, has largely proven to be an isolationist focused on ending wars, and has expressed no interest in becoming mired in wars with China over Taiwan or the Philippines.\nAt a December press conference, Trump said the U.S. and China could work together to solve global problems. But Ian Bremmer, president and founder of the political risk consultancy group Eurasia Group, said Trump’s instinct to defuse tensions may be hard to pull off. \n“It is severely constrained by how hard line Trump’s people are,” Bremmer said. But China, he added, has domestic troubles with its economy. “The Chinese are more inclined to want to stabilize this relationship than, certainly, they were under Trump’s first term. They’re under a lot more pressure.”\nFred Bergsten, nonresident senior fellow and director emeritus at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Trump’s threats of a trade war were a double-edged sword. \n“It clearly does accelerate the downward trend in the overall relationship,” he said, but noted that Trump’s first trade war with China actually led to dialogue. “I thought it was a promising approach to actually enhance diplomacy between the two countries, albeit in a context of confrontation.”\nBergsten said if the U.S. and China fail to cooperate, a lot of global issues could remain unresolved.\n“The U.S. and China together are on the way to making up half of the world economy. No other countries are even close,” he said. “So unless they can get together, not much is going to happen constructively on a whole range of economic and global commons issues.” \nThomas Fingar, a lecturer at Stanford University and a former U.S. intelligence official, said \nThe U.S. has made China out to be a “boogeyman” in its quest to maintain unquestioned global dominance, a dynamic that risks tipping the countries toward a needless war.\n“China is a big player that we bump up against everywhere in the world,” he said. “We want to stay king of the hill, and we can’t both be king of the hill at the same created_at. But is that really necessary? Is war inevitable, or are leaders in the two countries incapable of putting other interests ahead of bragging rights?”\nDeterrence vs. escalation\nSince China emerged as the world’s second largest economy in 2010 and later as the rival superpower to the U.S., it has forced a recalibration in Washington over the past few years to shift from counter-terrorism to confronting a Chinese military that now has a larger naval force than America.\nAcross the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. has built up alliances to deter China, uniting with Australia, the Philippines, Japan and other nations around Beijing to bolster defense ties, weapons production and military bases.\nCritics have called these moves escalatory because it’s in China’s backyard, forcing Chinese troops to engage in what the U.S. has called the largest peacecreated_at military buildup since World War II with an aim for a world-class military by 2049.\nJodie Evans, the co-founder of the anti-war activist organization Code Pink, said China is responding to the U.S. like any other country would to provocation. She argued China has been clear it wants to avoid conflict but the U.S. has been pushing through the “same playbook” it has used in the past, including in Iraq, to justify war.\n“There is absolutely not one thing that would justify a war, that would justify the United States going to war in China,” Evans said. “Diplomacy takes talking. Diplomacy takes making real steps. Diplomacy takes creating trust. United States has a lot of work to do.”\nMembers of Congress have accused Code Pink of close ties to China, pointing to Evans’ husband, Neville Roy Singham, a millionaire who reportedly has ties to Chinese media. Evans disputed that characterization and accused critics of trying to discredit her organization’s anti-war advocacy with “lies” and “crazy nonsense.”\nMany in Washington disagree with Code Pink and other anti-war activists, arguing that deterrence is best achieved in the motto of peace through strength. They have also blamed China for a lack of dialogue.\nRandall Schriver, a commissioner at the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, an independent governmental agency that reports to Congress, said the U.S. and China were “fundamentally at odds” over key issues, and that Chinese officials have often stymied diplomatic efforts.  \n“We have a status quo power who’s being challenged by a rising power that’s trying to upset the status quo and trying to redefine regional security frameworks,” he said. “It would not be unreasonable to say that most of the problems originated from Chinese behavior and the Chinese assertiveness to try to disrupt the status quo.”\nSchriver explained he wants more dialogue between the two countries, but that there are cultural differences and Americans tend to be “problem solvers” who want to solve issues that the Chinese may avoid engaging on.\nThe bigget fears of a military faceoff revolve around Taiwan. The self-governing island nation has been ruled by the government that fled the communist takeover in 1949, but China has always considered it as part of the mainland.  \nChina’s leader Xi, who came to power in 2013, told Biden in a November 2023 meeting that Beijing would unify with Taiwan, by force if necessary. There are fears he may do so as soon as 2027.\nThe U.S. has largely maintained strategic ambiguity over going to war to defend the Taiwanese people, but Biden’s promises to defend the island have sparked Chinese aggression.  \nChina has increased the pace of its military drills around Taiwan in recent years, particularly after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) led a delegation to the island in 2022 and following the inauguration of pro-U.S. Taiwanese President Willaim Lai Ching-te in May.\nGaming out war\nThe cost of a war over Taiwan could be immense for both sides, even threatening the superpower status of the loser. \nThe best modeling to date over a Taiwan war game scenario is from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), which in 2023 found that in most scenarios, the U.S., Japan and Taiwan defeated China but at the cost of “dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and tens of thousands of servicemembers.”\nThere are other scenarios: China could be easily defeated, avoiding mass American casualties; the U.S. could lose, suffering an immense blow; or there could be a stalemate.  \nThe results depend on a wide range of factors, including the will of the Taiwanese people to resist, if China launches a direct attack or a blockade, whether Japan and other allies join the fight or enable the U.S. to use key bases, and how soon American troops enter the fight.\nThe majority view in Washington, however, is that it’s a moral duty to prevent the forceful absorption of Taiwan from a communist government that has eroded human rights with takeovers in Tibet and Hong Kong and the suppression of the Uyghur minorities.  \nAllowing China to take Taiwan would also be an economic and geopolitical blow for the U.S., since Taipei is the primary source of semiconductor chips that power smart devices and a friendly economical hub in the Pacific.  \nStill, experts, activists and nonprofit officials have said Taiwan is not impossible to solve through diplomacy. And some say the U.S. has strayed too far from its adherence to the “One China” policy, which officially recognized Taiwan as part of China. \nMichael Desch, professor of international relations at the University of Notre Dame, which runs an institute on international peace, said there’s an obvious tension between that policy and U.S. support for increasing democratization on Taiwan.\n“The question is, can you manage it so it doesn’t get out of control?” he said. “We got to go back to the sort of diplomatic status quo of the 1990s. No Taiwan independence, no Chinese invasion and continuing U.S. recognition of One China.”\nSchriver, with the independent governmental commission that reports to Congress, said the U.S. and China are likely to hit “stale talking points” to address the issue diplomatically. He pointed to the need for more dialogue between Taipei and Beijing as the countries have not engaged each other since the Obama administration.\nNuclear arms race\nThe worst-case scenario in an escalating conflict between the U.S. and China would be either side turning to nuclear bombs.\nThe U.S. has more than 5,000 nuclear warheads, and China has some 600 but is rushing to quickly stockpile more, with the aim of at least 1,000 by the mid-2030s, according to the Pentagon.\nBoth the U.S. and China are also racing to modernize their nuclear arsenals and deploy more dangerous new weapons like autonomous drones. China’s military also can now launch nuclear weapons from submarines, aircraft, vehicles and missile silos.\nTo combat this, Biden in March approved a highly classified U.S. nuclear strategic plan that shifts Washington’s deterrent strategy to focus on Beijing’s fast expansion of its nuclear arsenal, the first created_at the U.S. has done so.\nNuclear arms control activists have long warned that a war between the U.S. and China poses an incredible risk of a nuclear escalation.\nAnd a new tabletop exercise, details of which were released last week, found that a further build-up of U.S. nuclear capabilities would have limited effect on whether China might use its own nuclear weapons should a war over Taiwan erupt.  \nThe first large-scale war game of such an incident, conducted by the CSIS and a war gaming lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that a U.S. build-up that goes past current modernization plans would not bolster nuclear deterrence in relation to Taiwan.\nU.S. policymakers should not “develop additional nuclear weapons for a conflict with China beyond current nuclear modernization plans” and “not pursue quantitative nuclear superiority in the expectation that it would deter China from using nuclear weapons,” the authors write.\nYun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center in Washington, said there is no definitive answer on whether China may use a nuclear weapon in the event of conflict over Taiwan.\n“Will they use nuclear weapons? I think from a military planning point of view, you will have to assume that they will, because a military planner will have to plan a budget for the worst-case scenario, and that is the worst-case scenario,” she said.\nChina, meanwhile, rejects U.S. concerns about its aims to further develop its nuclear forces, accusing Washington of using it as an excuse to grow its own nuclear arsenal.\nMaricreated_at flashpoints\nBesides Taiwan, the U.S. and China remain fundamentally at odds over the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost entirely as its own despite an opposing 2016 international court ruling. China has built up naval bases on artificial shoals in the Spratly Islands to bolsters its presence.\nThe Chinese claims have led to disputes with U.S. allies across the region, but mostly with the Philippines, which Washington has had a defense pact with for decades.\nIn the past few years, China has grown bolder in its spats with the Philippines over disputed reefs and shoals, attacking Filipino sailors and ships with water cannons, lasers and even, in an incident over the summer, with machetes.  \nWhile the U.S. has committed to defending the Philippines if it comes to it, there is some caution in foreign policy and national security circles over going to war with China over disputed reefs that are not part of the Filipino mainland.\nSome critical observers also say that the U.S. could do better in engaging with China over the South China Sea, arguing it is not an irreconcilable crisis.\nRobert Daly, the director of the Wilson Center’s Kissinger Institute on China and the United States, said the U.S. needs to be more careful in how it manages tensions in the Pacific and understand “China has a right to feel secure.”\n“The goal is not to go to war. China has …  legitimate security interests that they’re certainly going to pursue and defend, as do we,” he said. “And so the question is finding agreements that allow us to do that peacefully.”\nWhose world order?\nThe U.S. and China remain at odds on several other issues, but perhaps most salient is on how the world system should work.\nUnder Xi, China has become more authoritarian, and Beijing has drawn closer to like-minded countries, including Russia and Iran, drawing intense hostility from Washington that sees this loose coalition of dictatorial nations as bent on creating a more dangerous and volatile multipolar world.\nBut the U.S.-led liberal world order has also led to grievances from developing countries and the Global South, who have long taken issue with being left behind by an international economic system rife with inequalities. China has stepped into the void, financing projects in those countries under its contentious Belt and Road initiative that, while investing in other nations, has also been criticized for leaving them in debt.  \nStill, China has steered the framing of an alternative world order through BRICS, an economic organization helmed by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.\nBut for critics of U.S. hawkish views toward China, even these vastly opposing world views are not unsolvable.  \nWarren Cohen, a distinguished emeritus university professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore County who has long taught diplomatic studies, said China is not closely aligned with Russia or Iran, describing it more as a practical relationship.\nHe also said that Chinese interests don’t “extend around the world other than making some money.”\n“They’re not looking to take over the world order in the sense that the United States dominates it. They would like to weaken American control, they would like their part of the world to be free of an American presence, if possible, but I think that’s as far as it goes with them,” he said.\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.\n"

    "text": "\nLink to Story\nBuilding a new Taiwan of democracy, peace, and prosperity through integrated diplomacy\nTAIPEI, Taiwan - In 2024, the global landscape underwent rapid changes; geopolitical turmoil continued unabated; democracy and authoritarianism remained starkly divided; the Russia-Ukraine war deadlocked; and instability prevailed in the Middle East, the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, and even in the first island chain. All of these events highlighted the increasingly formidable challenges that the world faces from the axis of upheaval.\nMeanwhile, the Republic of China (Taiwan) successfully completed its eighth presidential election on January 13, another milestone in its democratic advancement. The situation across the Taiwan Strait continued to elicit a high level of international concern, while the Indo-Pacific became pivotal to global strategy. All of these developments were closely intertwined with Taiwan's national security and interests.\nDiplomats at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA ) and its overseas missions showed resilience and self-confidence. They did their utmost to safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty, dignity, and interests, as well as the Taiwanese people's rights and interests. Building on the excellent foundation laid by steadfast diplomacy over the past eight years, MOFA implemented integrated diplomacy, which aims at realizing values-based diplomacy and transforming Taiwan into a thriving global economic powerhouse as envisioned by president Lai Ching-te. Based on the three pillars of democracy, peace, and prosperity, MOFA fostered cooperation and deepened partnerships. MOFA pursued mutual benefits and co-prosperity with diplomatic allies and like-minded nations, demonstrating that Taiwan was a pivotal force for stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and underscoring its value as a global model of freedom and democracy.\nDemocratic Taiwan neither yielded nor provoked, remaining calm and confident. It worked with the global democratic community to respond to threats posed by authoritarian regimes. Taiwan stood firm and resilient against authoritarian expansionism, actively provided international humanitarian assistance during created_ats of crisis, and leveraged its strengths to share prosperity with diplomatic allies and like-minded countries. For its contributions, Taiwan gained worldwide acclaim and recognition from all sectors.\nWith the support of Taiwan's people, MOFA and its overseas missions spared no effort to promote head-of-state diplomacy. In December, president Lai led a delegation to Pacific diplomatic allies the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Palau under the theme\"Smart and Sustainable Development for a Prosperous Austronesian Region.\" He achieved the three main objectives of smart sustainability, sustainable democracy, and sustainable diplomatic ties while also making successful US transit stops in Hawaii and Guam. The tour was immensely productive and successfully consolidated international support for Taiwan. It both deepened Taiwan's friendships with allies and launched a new era of values-based diplomacy.\nIn October, minister of foreign affairs Lin Chia-lung, serving as special presidential envoy, attended celebrations marking the 45th anniversary of the independence of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. He also visited Guatemala, Saint Lucia, Belize, and Saint Christopher and Nevis, where he witnessed the achievements of values-based diplomacy and economic and trade diplomacy. In addition, he deepened partnerships on the foundations already laid for bilateral cooperation. In November, minister Lin visited Belgium, where the European Parliament is headquartered, as well as Lithuania and Poland, further enhancing democratic alliances and cooperation as well as economic and trade linkages between Taiwan and Europe.\nInternational friendship and support for Taiwan reached new heights this year. Following the successful completion of Taiwan's presidential and legislative elections in January, more than 1,600 prominent political figures from over 100 countries offered congratulations. Taiwan's significant success in diplomacy was substantively reflected through its solid formal alliances, rock-solid partnership with the United States, growing ties with Europe, and steadfast friendship with Japan. Diplomatic allies and like-minded nations spoke in support of Taiwan's international participation and reaffirmed the global consensus on maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. They lauded Taiwan as a force for good that safeguarded democratic values, provided humanitarian assistance, and made concrete contributions.\nMeanwhile, Taiwan has continued to deploy soft power, pursue public diplomacy, and seek international support. It has integrated resources across ministries, agencies, and departments to bolster its overall diplomatic strength. Furthermore, it has sought to have other countries implement consular measures addressing visas and digital governance to afford greater convenience to Taiwan's people while also promoting closer people-to-people exchanges with other nations.\nMOFA has devoted a maximum effort to the planning and implementation of the Diplomatic Allies Prosperity Project to deepen substantive relations with allies and like-minded countries. MOFA has formulated eight flagship projects concerning the Five Trusted Industry Sectors, covering semiconductor supply chain resilience, reliable networks and digital governance, new energy and carbon credit cooperation, smart demonstration parks overseas, smart medicine and healthcare, smart agriculture, sovereign AI, and sustainable tourism. Taiwan has brought its industrial strengths to play while integrating the resources of all ministries and agencies. Through the export of smart solutions, Taiwan has stimulated the prosperous development of allies and bolstered democratic supply chains. This has consolidated diplomatic ties and is helping allies enjoy greater prosperity.\nTaiwan is greeting a new world and the world is greeting a new Taiwan. Not only is this MOFA's mission in its diplomatic work, it is also the stellar outcome of coordinated efforts by the Taiwanese people and related agencies. MOFA has helped to promote the Executive Yuan's economic diplomacy task force and has a strategic team conducting research and administrative work for the task force. This task force facilitates the efficient integration of resources from across ministries, enabling every citizen to be a diplomat and every ministry to serve as a foreign ministry.\nMOFA will continue to improve the efficiency and quality of its public-facing services so that they have a tangible and positive impact on people's lives. It will work diligently for the dignity, rights, interests, continuity, and development of the nation and people. MOFA will utilize Taiwan's strengths as it connects to the world and work steadily to promote technology diplomacy, human rights diplomacy, cultural diplomacy, urban diplomacy, parliamentary diplomacy, medical and public health diplomacy, environmental diplomacy, sports diplomacy, indigenous diplomacy, religious diplomacy, and gender equality diplomacy. MOFA will help the international community better understand the important role that Taiwan plays. It will live up to the expectations of all sectors as concerns diplomatic efforts.\nIn 2025, the world will usher in a new chapter in geopolitics. With confidence, resilience, and a professional and flexible approach, MOFA will maintain its footing in the new environment. It will leverage Taiwan's strengths; overcome challenges; and amplify the values of democracy, peace, and prosperity. By integrating diplomatic momentum from all sectors, MOFA will continue to contribute to the international community and realize president Lai's policy of values-based diplomacy and vision of Taiwan as a thriving global economic powerhouse. MOFA will demonstrate that Taiwan can help and that Taiwan can lead so that Taiwan continues to serve as a beacon shining far and wide across the globe.\nThe post Taiwan 2024 Diplomacy Review appeared first on Caribbean News Global .\nMENAFN07012025000232011072ID1109065989\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-08",
    "text": "\n2025 JAN 08 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Defense & Aerospace Daily -- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from osf.io:\n “When Richard Samuels raised the prospect of a ‘Goldilocks Consensus' in regards to Japan's relationship vis a vis China, he was positing the idea that Japan should hedge. Samuels identified a need for Japan to grow stronger whilst avoiding growing sufficiently powerful as to pose a threat to China, while simultaneously positioning itself not too close and not too far from the United States, its security guarantor.\n “In short, Japan should aim to get the relationship ‘just right', hence the faerie-tale analogy. Moving further south within Asia, an examination of the evolving relationship between Vietnam and China shows this is precisely the strategy Vietnam is adopting vis a vis China, albeit within an entirely different security dynamic.\n “In essence, Vietnam's hedging strategy, comprising what Goh has defined as a form of “triangular politics” between Vietnam, China and the United States, is a strategy predicated on working for the best whilst preparing for the worst. It is a strategy that seeks to combine a mixture of balancing, containment, engagement and enmeshment as a form of insurance against an uncertain strategic future. This paper will argue that, due to Thayer's “tyranny of geography' - where Vietnam's shared northern continental border and their long snaking eastern littoral coastline bordering the South China Sea have inevitably thrown Vietnam's and China's interests together - Vietnam is more threatened by China's rise than any other regional state.\n “As Goh states, “the tyranny of geography renders the two countries strategic rivals.” Consequently, as China continues to rise, this paper argues that Vietnam will increasingly seek to hedge with the United States, increasing military and security ties with the western hegemon as part of a nuanced strategy, which also includes engagement with China (particularly through growing trade and economic ties); which seeks to enmesh China in multilateral institutions within the regional security architecture; and which seeks to strengthen its own security position through a program of military modernisation and selective military expansion. This nuanced strategy we shall call hedging.”\n This preprint has not been peer-reviewed.\n For more information on this research see: osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w8q7b/\n Keywords for this news article include: Asia, China, Military and Defense, Social Sciences, Vietnam. \n Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world.

    "text": "\n2025 JAN 08 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Climate Change Daily News -- Investigators publish new report on global warming and climate change. According to news reporting originating from Zhanjiang, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Hainan medaka (Oryzias curvinotus) is a small euryhaline fish species native to the northern margin of the South China Sea. Our long-term field observations indicate a concerning decline in its wild resources.\" \n Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Guangdong Ocean University: \"Climate change, an uncontrollable factor, has altered the species' distribution pattern. In this study, we simulated the shifts in the species range of O. curvinotus during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), current, and the next one hundred year, and analyzed its habitat attributes. The results demonstrate that bio2 (mean diurnal range of temperature) is a crucial factor in shaping the species range of O. curvinotus. The simulation results reveal that the current habitats are located in the coastal areas of northern Vietnam, the northeastern Hainan Province, the coastal areas of Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and a few areas in Taiwan Province of China, covering a total area of 17.82 x 104 km2. Highly suitable habitats are mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of Hai Phong, Nam Dinh, and Thanh Hoa in northern Vietnam, the central part of Leizhou Peninsula, and the west coast of the Pearl River Estuary. For the tropical species Hainan medaka, the impact of the LGM was relatively minor, and there were extensive suitable habitats during historical created_ats, including three refugia. Currently, only Refugium 2 near Guanghai Town, Taishan County, Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province in China remains, while the other two refugia have submerged below sea level. Future climate warming under different carbon emission levels is projected to cause a short-term expansion, followed by a relief in expansion. By 2100, the potential habitat area of O. curvinotus is slightly larger than the current scenario. It is noteworthy that under future climate warming scenarios, the highly suitable habitats will not migrate northward but will expand near the 21°N latitude.\" \n According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Overall, Hainan medaka is not expected to be threatened in the future. Our study provides long-term dynamic distribution data, which provides a theoretical basis for the long-term development and conservation management of Hainan medaka.\" \n For more information on this research see: Habitat changes of a small endemic euryhaline fish species in the northern margin of the South China Sea under the background of global warming.

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:\nBeijing has denied any infringement of Philippine jurisdiction rights by sending its largest coast guard vessel to near the disputed Scarborough Shoal inside the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a press briefing that the coast guard \"conducts its patrols and law enforcement activities in relevant waters in full accordance with the law.\"\n\"It is fully justified,\" he added.\nRepeated confrontations in disputed waters over the past year have raised fears of conflict between China and U.S. ally the Philippines.\nIn the latest development, the 12,000-ton CCG5901, dubbed \"The Monster\" because of its size, seemed to have left the coastline off Zambales, in the central Luzon region of the Philippines, and was about 90 nautical miles offshore as of Wednesday afternoon, the Philippine coast guard, or PCG, said.\nAnother Chinese coast guard ship the CCG3103 - is heading to the area and was likely to serve as a replacement vessel for the monster ship to maintain China's \"illegal presence\" within the exclusive economic zone, it said.\nBesides the CCG5901 and CCG3103, there are at least six other Chinese coast guard vessels in the waters in which the Philippines holds jurisdiction rights to resources.\n\"The Monster\" had been operating in an area 60-70 nautical miles from Zambales for the previous four days, according to spokesperson Jay Tarriela, who said that coast guard vessel BRP Cabra was deployed to closely monitor the \"illegal\" Chinese ship.\nChina \"has provocatively deployed a People's Liberation Army Navy helicopter, tail number 47\" to the area, Tarriela said in a statement. The Philippine coast guard has been ordered by its commandant to refrain from action that could escalate tension, he added.\nThe Philippine military on Tuesday confirmed that it would continue conducting maricreated_at and air patrols in the West Philippine Sea, or part of the South China Sea under Manila's jurisdiction.\nThe Global created_ats, a Chinese newspaper known for its hawkish stance, said the Philippines was \"hyping up\" the CCG5901's \"normal\" activities.\nChinese analyst Ding Duo was quoted as saying that after China announced the baselines around Huangyan Dao, the Chinese name for Scarborough Shoal, both the Chinese navy and coastguard were \"set to increase their routine patrols and exercises in the area, and the Philippines needs to adapt to this process.\"\nThat meant the current campaign, seen by Manila as an illegal act of intimidation, was set to continue.\nU.S. aircraft carrier\nMeanwhile, a carrier strike group led by the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70), has been operating in the South China Sea since Jan. 3.\nSailors signal aircraft during routine flight operations on the flight deck of the USS Carl Vinson on Jan. 7, 2025.(Petty Officer 3rd Class Nathan J/U.S. Navy)\nThe strike group includes the embarked Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2, cruiser USS Princeton (CG-59) and destroyers USS Sterett (DDG-104) and USS William P. Lawrence (DDG-110).\nThe U.S. Navy has released a number of photos showing the Carl Vinson and its accompanying vessels conducting daily \"routine operations\" to reaffirm freedom of navigation in the waterway.\nIt did not specify the carrier's exact location and only said that it was \"in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations.\"\n\"U.S. forces operate in the South China Sea on a daily basis,\" the 7th Fleet has repeatedly said in its statements. \"The United States upholds freedom of navigation for all nations as a principle.\"\n\"No member of the international community should be intimidated or coerced into giving up their rights and freedoms,\" it said.\nBesides the Carl Vinson strike group, U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Higgins (DDG 76) was also spotted conducting a firearms shooting training for its sailors on Tuesday in the South China Sea.\nThe Philippines and the U.S. in 1951 signed a Mutual Defense Treaty that commits the allies to help each other in created_at of attack by a third party.\nEdited by RFA Staff.\nBenarNews is an RFA-affiliated news organization.\n"

    "text": "\nJanuary 7th, 2025 (Business Matters — Delivered by Newstex)\nFor those interested in shipping jobs and the wider journey that sees products arriving here in the UK, it's useful to understand the top shipping routes in the world.Shipping routes are the lifelines of global trade, facilitating the movement of goods across continents.These routes are strategically important for international commerce, connecting major ports and economic hubs and provide great shipping jobs for mariners.Outlined below are some of the top shipping routes in the world.The English Channel\nFrequently referred to as the world's busiest shipping lane, the English Channel links the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean.It serves as a critical passage for vessels travelling between the ports of Northern Europe and the rest of the world.The narrow stretch of water between England and France sees a high volume of commercial and passenger traffic.The Strait of Malacca\nThis is one of the most important shipping lanes in the world, connecting the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea to the Pacific Ocean.The strait is a key route for oil and goods travelling from the Middle East to Asia, especially China and Japan.Its strategic significance is underscored by the fact that it is one of the shortest sea routes between the Persian Gulf and Asian markets.The Suez Canal\nConnecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, the Suez Canal is a vital shortcut for vessels travelling between Europe and Asia, eliminating the need to navigate around the southern tip of Africa.The canal significantly reduces travel created_at and distance, making it a crucial route for global trade.The Panama Canal\nThis man-made waterway in Central America connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, allowing vessels to avoid the lengthy and hazardous route around the southern tip of South America.The canal is essential for trade between the east and west coasts of America, as well as between Asia and the eastern United States.The Strait of Hormuz\nSituated between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, the Strait of Hormuz is one of the world's key passageways.It is the primary route for oil exports from the Gulf countries, making it a critical stretch of water for global energy supply.The Bosporus Strait\nThis narrow, natural strait in Turkey connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, and ultimately the Mediterranean Sea.The Bosporus is a major route for Oil and Gas shipments from Russia and the Caspian region to Europe and beyond.The South China Sea\nThis sea is a key maricreated_at route for trade between Asia, Europe and the Middle East.It is one of the busiest waterways in the world, with a sizeable portion of the world's shipping passing through it.The South China Sea is also rich in resources, making it a focal point for geopolitical tensions.The North Atlantic Route\nThis transatlantic route links the ports of North America with those in Europe.It is a key passage for the exchange of goods between these two economically significant regions.These shipping routes are not only vital for the transportation of goods but also play a crucial role in the global economy.They are influenced by geopolitical factors, technological advancements and environmental considerations, all of which can impact their efficiency and security.Read more: \nA Review of the World's Top Shipping Routes\n\nN"

    "text": "\nMost Asian countries have sought to maintain their strategic autonomy and avoid taking sides in the competition between China and the United States. However, under pressure from the US, some nations have made notable shifts in their China policies, regional strategies and approaches to handling sensitive issues.\nLink to Image\nIn Northeast Asia, Japan's policy toward China has increasingly leaned toward \"aligning with the US to contain China\". Militarily, Japan has significantly expanded its defense budget; economically, it is pushing for \"de-risking\" from China; and in terms of security, it actively supports NATO's expansion into the Asia-Pacific region. Japan's ambition to leverage the US to gain dominance over Asian affairs is becoming more evident in its playing along with the US in stirring tensions in the East China Sea, the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.\nThe Republic of Korea's China policy under the current administration has shown a clear tilt toward aligning with the US and distancing from China. Seoul has actively bolstered the US-ROK alliance and advanced trilateral cooperation with Washington and Tokyo. It has adopted a hardline stance toward China on several key issues, including joining the US-led \"Chip 4 Alliance\", participating in the \"Indo-Pacific\" Economic Framework for Prosperity, and publicly aligning with the US on matters related to the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.\nIn Southeast Asia, some countries have exhibited growing tendencies to \"align with the US to counter China\", with the Philippines being particularly prominent. The Ferdinand Marcos Jr. administration not only reopened and expanded US access to military bases in the country but also actively supported multilateral security frameworks, such as the US-Japan-Philippines and US-Philippines-Australia partnerships. As external powers such as the US and Japan increase their involvement in the South China Sea, the Philippines has adopted a much harder line on its maricreated_at dispute with China.\nIn South Asia, India has drawn closer to the US strategically. The Narendra Modi administration has taken a hard stance on issues such as border disputes and economic frictions with China, continuously provoking tensions. Regionally, India has embraced the Quad (the US, Japan, Australia and India), while distancing itself from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS mechanisms. India hopes to leverage US and Western support to replace China as a global manufacturing hub and achieve its goal of rising as a major power.\nClearly, these nations' decisions to align with the US aim to reap four strategic \"dividends\". First, on security, they hope cooperation with the US will bolster their own defense assurances. Second, economically, they anticipate gaining trade, investment and technological cooperation benefits from the US. Third, geopolitically, they aim to counterbalance China's influence with US support. Last, internationally, they seek to elevate their status through their alignment with the US.\nHowever, the reality has not unfolded as they expected. Countries choosing to side with the US have paid a steep price for doing so. On security, they are pushed to the forefront of confrontation with China, facing increased risks of conflict and military friction. Economically, they have failed to reap the anticipated dividends, while deteriorating relations with China have caused them to miss opportunities for deeper cooperation. Politically, their diplomatic autonomy has been significantly weakened, leaving little room for policy adjustments and placing them in an increasingly passive position amid China-US competition.\nWashington has made numerous promises of financial aid, market access and industrial relocation opportunities to get countries to side with it. However, these promises have largely remained hollow.\nFor example, while the \"Indo-Pacific\" Economic Framework for Prosperity has been highly publicized, it lacks substantive measures for market access and trade benefits, falling far short of what the member countries hoped for. The CHIPS Act, ostensibly aimed at building a \"secure semiconductor supply chain\" with allies, has instead prioritized \"America First\".Most subsidies have gone to US-based companies, while foreign companies, including those in Japan and the ROK, face strict restrictions when applying for funds.\nThe \"side-choosing\" countries have also overestimated their role and influence in China-US competition. They imagined they could \"sit on top of the mountain to watch the tigers fight\", reaping benefits while the US took the lead in confronting China.\nIn reality, when conflict risks with China have escalated, the US often \"hit the brake\", seeking engagement with China to manage risks and prevent escalation. For \"side-choosing\" countries, however, the US continues to \"press the accelerator\", pushing them directly to the forefront of confrontation with China — whether through upgrading military alliances with Japan and the Philippines or reinforcing trilateral cooperation with the ROK.\nAs a result, these countries find themselves not in control of the situation but deeply bound to the US, becoming \"proxy conflict actors\" in the great power rivalry. More critically, as geopolitical tensions persist, their strategic expectations remain unmet, while Asia's economic cooperation and security environment are dragged into a \"high-risk zone\". Through swift and precise responses across economic, diplomatic, legal and law enforcement domains, China has significantly raised the strategic costs of pursuing anti-China policies.\nWhat lessons can Asian nations draw from this?\nFirst, in the face of China-US competition, Asian nations should avoid taking sides. Rather than trying to speculate on who will win, they should focus on maintaining their strategic autonomy and balancing relationships to preserve their policy flexibility and diplomatic independence.\nSecond, Asian countries must reassess US motives for intervening in regional conflicts. Whether in the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea or the Korean Peninsula, Washington's involvement under the pretext of \"peace and stability\" has often escalated tensions and created regional divisions. Asian nations must remain highly vigilant.\nThird, when addressing disputes with China, Asian nations should prioritize risk management and avoid escalation. Recent efforts by China and India to cool border tensions demonstrate that dialogue and negotiation remain the most effective means for resolving differences and frictions.\nFourth, to mitigate the risks of a new Cold War, Asian countries should influence the trajectory of China-US competition through cooperation and coordination. By building communication platforms, they can promote cooperation and reduce confrontation. Advancing regional integration and maintaining an open and inclusive order will showcase regional unity and strategic autonomy, adding \"guardrails \"to this competition.\nThe author is an associate research fellow at the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

    "text": "\nIndonesia and Japan said they want to strengthen maricreated_at co-operation as their leaders prepare to meet later this week, amid concerns over Jakarta's recent move to join the BRICS alliance, which has raised questions about its growing ties with China.\nIndonesian Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin received a visit on Tuesday from Japan's ­Defence Minister, Gen Nakatani, in Jakarta, where they said the two countries wanted to enhance interoperability between the Indonesian Navy and Japan's Maricreated_at Self-Defence Force.\n\"We recognise the importance of co-operation in military equipment to enhance the maricreated_at capabilities of both countries,\" Mr Sjamsoeddin said in a statement. \n\"The co-operation between our two countries has great potential, especially in enhancing regional stability through military co-operation, capacity building, and improving interoperability.\"\nTuesday's visit was part of the preparation for the bilateral meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Indonesia President Prabowo Subianto on Friday.\nThe Japanese government is seeking confirmation whether the Indonesian side is still interested in a proposed joint development of vessels, including frigates and submarines, according to reports from Japanese media. Australia and Germany reportedly have been involved in this program.\nDefence Ministry spokesman Frega Ferdinand Wenas said while the two ministers discussed \"co-operation on defence technology transfer\", they had yet to talk about any specific procurement.\n\"Technology transfer cannot happen quickly; it will take created_at, but it was discussed. Both defence ministers agreed that there should be co-operation, and we will explore how this can be developed, whether in naval vessels or other defence equipment,\" he said.\nIndonesia controls strategic sea routes including parts of the Malacca Straits, one of the key ­focuses in Japan's maricreated_at strategy in the Indo-Pacific. Japan also has particular interest in developing Indonesia's far flung islands that border the highly contested South China Sea, where Beijing has made sweeping one-sided claims. \nSuch claims were invalidated in a 2016 international ­tribunal ruling referencing UNCLOS, which Beijing has chosen to ­ignore. Vietnam, Malaysia, The Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan all have competing claims in the ­waters.\nHowever, in November last year, the Indonesian government unwittingly signed off a joint statement with Beijing in which they recognised \"areas of overlapping claims\", which experts believe undermined the country's existing position of not recognising China's Nine Dash Line claim over the South China Sea and which consequently meant Indonesia had no dispute with China.\nIndonesia raised eyes earlier this week when it officially joined the BRICS group in a move that is feared to have positioned it closer to China and Russia, the largest members of the organisation that self-identifies as a non-Western ­alliance. However, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry said its membership to BRICS only reflected its goal to amplify the Global South voice.\nMr Wenas said the move was based on Indonesia's principle of an independent and active foreign policy.\n\"We don't want to side with any particular block - left, right, north, south, or east. We aim to collaborate with other nations for the stability, peace, and prosperity of Indonesia,\" he said. \n\"But from our standpoint, we adopt an independent policy that allows us to form relationships for Indonesia's benefit.\"\n\nNotes\nDocument links may not lead to an active page.

Biden, known to be a pious Catholic, is due to stay in Italy through Sunday.\n Kirby said the meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is aimed at further strengthening \"our trilateral partnership and our efforts toward a secure Indo-Pacific region.\"\n Biden organized the first-ever summit of the United States, Japan and the Philippines in April last year, as part of his administration's attempt to push back against China's ambitions in the region.\n A day after Biden hosted then Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for an official meeting and a lavish state dinner in Washington, the three leaders expressed \"serious concerns\" about China's \"dangerous and aggressive\" actions in the South China Sea.\n The major initiatives agreed upon by the three leaders included assisting Philippine defense modernization efforts and making plans to conduct a joint maricreated_at exercise of naval forces around Japan in 2025.\n Biden will leave office on Jan. 20. Kirby said the upcoming travel to Italy is his last overseas trip as U.S. president.\n The White House said last month that Biden will have an audience with the pontiff on Friday to \"discuss efforts to advance peace around the world.\"\n==Kyodo\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-08",
    "text": "\n China's largest Coast Guard vessel has begun to sail away from the waters off Zambales after loitering there for four days, only to be replaced by another Chinese ship in what authorities call a calculated move to maintain Beijing's illegal presence in the area.\nThe Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) vessel 5901 - known as the \"monster ship\" for being the world's biggest Coast Guard vessel - moved farther away from the Zambales coastline on Wednesday, January 8, according to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG). The vessel was last seen 90 nautical miles from the shoreline after spending four days within up to 60 nautical miles of it.\nWithin hours of its departure, another Chinese vessel appears to have taken its place. At 3 p.m. today, the PCG spotted CCG-3103, which had left China's Guangdong Province a day earlier, positioning itself 60 nautical miles from Pandaquit, Zambales - around the same area the monster ship had just vacated.\n\"This indicates that CCG-3103 is likely serving as a replacement vessel for the monster ship, thereby sustaining its illegal presence within the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone,\" PCG spokesperson Jay Tarriela said.\nPCG Commandant Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan deployed the PCG Islander aircraft to confirm CCG-3103's presence, which the Coast Guard first detected using Canada's dark vessel tracker. PCG vessel BRP Cabra is now heading to the area to \"monitor and challenge its presence,\" the PCG said.\nBoth positions of the Chinese vessels fall within the Philippines' 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone, which gives Manila sovereign rights over the waters.\nPCG vessels sent to monitor the ship's activities have repeatedly issued radio challenges to ask the vessel to sail out of the West Philippine Sea. Clips of these radio challenges show PCG personnel citing the 2016 arbitral award, UNCLOS and the recently passed Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Law.\nThe PCG said yesterday that China had deployed a military helicopter to hover above a PCG vessel during one of these monitoring activities. This prompted Gavan to direct his personnel to \"remain unthreatened and to refrain from actions that could escalate tensions,\" according to the PCG's statement on Tuesday, January 7.\nMalacañang yesterday expressed concern over the presence of the 12,000-ton Chinese vessel. Without detailing the Philippines' response, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin said the \"issue here is about projection.\"\nWhile foreign vessels are allowed to pass through the Philippines' EEZ, the PCG on Monday explained that CCG 5901's \"erratic movements\" indicate that it is not there for 'innocent passage.'\nThe presence of China's monster ship comes a month after the December 4 incident where, for the first created_at, two Chinese warships (People's Liberation Army Navy vessels) blocked and shadowed a PCG vessel at Scarborough Shoal (Bajo de Masinloc).\nBeijing has continued to press its claims to almost the entire South China Sea despite an international tribunal ruling in 2016 that nullified its claim of historic rights over the waters.\n"

    "title": "ASEAN Media Should Strengthen Collaboration, Craft Unified Regional Narrative - Bernama Chairman",
    "created_at": "2025-01-08",
    "text": "\n 08 Jan 2025 (BERNAMA News Agency) ASEAN media organisations have been urged to work together to craft and disseminate a compelling regional narrative that highlights the bloc's aspirations, cultural richness and strategic importance.\nIn making the call, Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) Chairman Datuk Seri Wong Chun Wai emphasised the need for ASEAN to break away from its reliance on Western media perspectives by strengthening collaboration among the region's media to present a unified and accurate regional narrative to the world.\nWith over 600 million people in the region, ASEAN, he said, is a vital bloc with diverse languages and cultures, and while English serves as a common language, the need for deeper collaboration among ASEAN media outlets has never been more crucial.\n'In the case of the South China Sea, which is part of our backyard and our home, we have a much better understanding of the region than many Western media outlets. Yet, we continue to rely on their narratives, which often seek to depict the area as a conflict zone.\n'But the ASEAN approach is different. We strive for engagement and neutrality. We do not take sides, and we are committed to ensuring peace in the region,\" he told reporters after moderating a session at the ASEAN Economic Opinion Leaders Conference: Outlook for 2025 here today\nAdditionally, Wong said ASEAN's media must shift the narrative away from the negative perceptions often presented by external media agencies.\n'For me personally, I would like to see an ASEAN media network where we could exchange our content whether in news, video, TikTok or Instagram.\n'By diversifying content and highlighting the softer aspects of ASEAN, such as tourism, food, lifestyle and music, the region's media can foster greater engagement and interest among global audiences,' he said.\nWong said it is essential that Malaysia showcases its capability to perform its ASEAN duties in a superb and effective manner, and hopes that all media companies and locals will play their part in making the country impactful for ASEAN.\nThe panellists for the forum were South China Morning Post executive managing editor Zuraidah Ibrahim and Thai veteran journalist on regional affairs Kavi Chongkittavorn.\nMeanwhile, Zuraidah also called for greater collaboration among ASEAN media organisations to tackle pressing issues that transcend national borders.\n'We need an ASEAN newsroom that allows us to work across borders to investigate critical matters such as migration, climate change, financial scams and labour issues. These challenges affect us all across the region,' she said.\nShe emphasised the need for pooling resources to enable more in-depth reporting among media agencies in the region as it can provide stronger and more comprehensive coverage of the issues that matter most to the people of ASEAN.\nKavi emphasised that ASEAN needs journalists who can craft narratives that truly resonate with the region's diversity and complexity, pointing out the shortage of media professionals who fully grasp ASEAN's significance.\nHe highlighted the importance of having personified opinions in today's media landscape, where external news sources such as social media often overshadow local perspectives.\n'ASEAN journalists need to write their own views about global issues, particularly on the environment. Don't be afraid ... so be bold in putting out your view. So I think educational institutions and senior journalists must take responsibility for preparing future journalists to navigate these concerns,' he said.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-08",
    "text": "\nThe Vietnam Peoples Navy has spotlighted the operational capabilities of its Molniya-class corvettes, highlighting their role as a decisive force in maricreated_at security. Tailored for surface combat, these agile warships carry an arsenal of 16 anti-ship missiles, making them a formidable counter to any naval threat. With modular reloading systems and advanced design, the Molniya-class showcases Vietnams commitment to modernizing its fleet and asserting control over its territorial waters.\nEach Molniya-class corvette is equipped to fire up to sixteen anti-ship missiles in a single sortie. This makes them a potent force in regional naval operations, particularly in contested waters where maricreated_at superiority is critical. The missile armament consists of advanced Kh-35E Uran-E anti-ship missiles, known for their reliability and precision in targeting. These missiles are housed in KT-184 quad launchers, which allow for simultaneous engagement of multiple targets, enhancing the ships operational tempo in high-stakes engagements.\nOne of the standout features of the Molniya-class corvettes is their innovative reload system. During combat or training exercises, personnel can rapidly swap out the KT-184 quad launchers, ensuring minimal downcreated_at between volleys. This design prioritizes operational sustainability and ensures the ship remains combat-ready even after expending its initial missile load.\nThis reload efficiency not only enhances the ships endurance in prolonged engagements but also allows it to adapt quickly to evolving tactical scenarios. By enabling a swift return to readiness, this capability reinforces the corvettes role as frontline assets in the VPNs surface warfare doctrine.\nDesigned with a focus on coastal defense and blue-water engagements, the Molniya-class corvettes represent a critical component of Vietnams naval strategy. Their agility, coupled with their powerful missile systems, positions them as effective deterrents against hostile naval incursions. Additionally, the platforms ability to deliver sustained offensive capabilities makes it an invaluable asset in the VPNs efforts to safeguard its maricreated_at interests and assert its presence in the South China Sea.\nTechnical data\nThe Molniya-class corvettes feature a planing hull design, constructed primarily of steel with aluminum alloy superstructures to reduce weight and enhance speed. Their compact size and shallow draft allow for effective operations in littoral zones. The vessels have a displacement of approximately 550-600 tons, a length of 56.1 meters, a beam of 10.2 meters, and a draft of 2.5 meters.\nTheir propulsion system consists of twin gas turbines and diesel engines in a combined diesel and gas (CODAG) configuration. This setup provides a maximum speed of 38-40 knots and an operational range of 1,650 nautical miles at 12 knots, suitable for rapid response missions along coastlines.\nArmament is centered on advanced anti-ship missile systems, including the P-270 Moskit or Kh-35 missiles, capable of engaging large naval targets at extended ranges. This offensive capability is complemented by a 76.2mm naval gun for versatile engagement of surface, aerial, and ground threats. Close-range defense is provided by twin AK-630M systems, offering robust protection against incoming missiles and aircraft. Additional point-defense capabilities include Igla-M systems, and some configurations enhance versatility with torpedoes and depth charges for anti-submarine warfare.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-08",
    "text": "\nThe Philippines on Tuesday said it views with alarm the presence of China’s largest coast guard ship within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), vowing to continue sea patrols.\n“We view it with concern,” Executive Secretary Lucas P. Bersamin told a news briefing at the presidential palace. “So far, we have been challenging the presence of that monster ship.”\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) on Monday said the “erratic movements” of the 165-meter-long China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel 5901, which Manila calls a “monster ship,” within the Philippine EEZ indicate it is not engaged in innocent passage.\n“The Coast Guard, our Coast Guard, has always been very alert in following up the presence of that monster ship,” said Mr. Bersamin, who heads the National Maricreated_at Council.\nWhile there has been no confrontation, it calls for continued vigilance, he added.\nThe Philippines would pursue diplomatic means to resolve its sea dispute with China, including the filing of protests and engaging with the Chinese government in high-level talks, Mr. Bersamin said.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard earlier said the Chinese vessel was “conducting a law enforcement operation, claiming jurisdiction over these waters as belonging to the People’s Republic of China.”\nThe monster ship was last spotted 65 nautical miles southwest of Los Frailes Island in Zambales province in northern Philippines.\nThe PCG said the 44.5-meter BRP Cabra has “remained steadfast” in challenging China’s assertion, “diligently tailing and shadowing CCG-5901 to uphold Philippine sovereign rights.”\nIt said the Philippine Coast Guard vessel continues to send radio challenges to the Chinese ship.\nChina’s largest coast guard ship was positioned 54 nautical miles off Capones Island in Zambales, the PCG said on Sunday, citing Canada’s dark vessel detection system.\nAfter Philippine authorities detected the ship, PCG Commandant Ronnie Gil L. Gavan promptly ordered the dispatch of BRP Cabra along with a PCG helicopter and PCG caravan “to verify the incursion and assert their presence.”\nThe PCG earlier called the ship’s presence an act of Chinese “intimidation, coercion and aggression.”\n“We have all our assets pointed at this monster ship. The moment it (carries out) any provocative action, it will be met with appropriate response,” Jonathan E. Malaya, spokesman for the National Security Council, told state television on Monday.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTies between China and the Philippines have soured in the past few years, with spats frequent as Manila under President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. pushes back at what it sees as aggression by Beijing. China has accused the Philippines of repeated encroachment in its waters.\nChina claims most of the South China Sea, a key conduit for $3 trillion of annual ship-borne trade, as its own territory, with a massive coast guard presence in and around the EEZs of neighbors Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia.\nBeijing rejects a 2016 ruling by the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that said those expansive maricreated_at claims were illegal.\nThe PCG had ordered the Chinese vessel to leave the area, warning it has no authority to operate there, according to a video it shared. In its radioed response, the Chinese ship said it was conducting law enforcement duties within its jurisdictional waters.\n“This is part of China’s intimidation, coercion, aggression and deception. They are showcasing their ship to intimidate our fishermen,” Mr. Malaya said, adding that the Philippine maricreated_at presence would be boosted to support fishermen.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-08",
    "text": "\nA U.S. Navy seaman is accused of pulling double duty as a shipboard drug dealer while serving on the San Diego-based nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, only getting caught after a batch of bogus Percocet tainted with fentanyl killed a fellow sailor.\nBailey Szramowski, 27, knew the pills were laced, but sold them to at least two shipmates anyway, according to a federal complaint filed Tuesday.\nSzramowski, who does not yet have an attorney listed in court records, was unable to be reached for comment. A Navy spokesman told The Independent he would look into Szramowski's service status as he awaits trial.\nThe USS Lincoln is known as the carrier on which former President George W. Bush delivered his now-infamous \"Mission Accomplished\" speech in 2003, declaring major combat operations in Iraq to be over amid fighting that continued to drag on for another nine years.\nLink to Image\nThe case against Szramowski, a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, native, stems from a fatal January 3, 2023, overdose that left a USS Lincoln sailor dead, according to the complaint. The victim, identified in court filings only as \"A.N.,\" was on leave at the created_at, staying in an RV parked outside his aunt and uncle's house in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nOfficers from the San Leandro Police Department say they searched the RV and discovered \"evidence of drug use - specifically, a rolled-up dollar bill that had a white substance fall out when investigators handled it,\" the complaint states. An autopsy later concluded that A.N. had died of \"acute fentanyl intoxication.\"\nTen days after A.N.'s death, a second sailor stationed onboard the USS Lincoln was rushed to the hospital following an apparent OD, the complaint goes on. It says first responders successfully revived the sailor, who is identified in the complaint as \"C.L.,\" with Narcan, a prescription nasal spray used to counteract opioid overdoses.\nFollowing C.L.'s release from the hospital on January 17, 2023, he agreed to cooperate with Naval Criminal Investigative Service agents probing the source of the fentanyl, according to the complaint. He fingered Szramowski as his dealer, and said he and other sailors had been buying Percosets - branded oxycodone pills, which, in this instance, investigators believe were counterfeit - for roughly a year, the complaint explains.\nLink to Image\nSzramowski sold the pills to C.L. about 10 created_ats during the USS Lincoln's 2022 deployment to the South China Sea, and another four created_ats after the carrier returned to San Diego, including on the day of his OD, according to the complaint. It says C.L. told agents that Szramowski's source sent the pills to a Post Office Box in Coronado, California, and that Szramowski's shipboard customers typically paid him via CashApp.\nWhen Szramowski heard that C.L. was planning to meet with NCIS, he called him and said to tell the agents he had in fact gotten the deadly pills from A.N., the complaint contends.\nIn a separate interview with NCIS, A.N.'s aunt and uncle, who were the ones to find A.N.'s text, said Szramowski called them once he heard the news and tried, unsuccessfully, to convince them to delete any messages from him on A.N.'s phone, the complaint goes on. It says Szramowski was concerned that if law enforcement saw the exchanges, \"he 'might go down for murder,' or it would 'ruin his future,' or words to that effect.\"\nNext, NCIS agents interviewed A.N.'s former fiancée, \"G.G.,\" according to the complaint. She confirmed that Szramowski had been A.N.'s plug, and told the agents that Szramowski also got high on his own supply, the complaint continues.\nLink to Image\nG.G. said she had driven with A.N. to his aunt and uncle's place in Northern California, where he died, according to the complaint. On the way there, G.G. told NCIS, A.N. showed her a baggie containing 10 \"Percocets\" he said he bought from Szramowski for $100, the complaint states. In the aftermath of A.N.'s fatal overdose, G.G. said she went through his belongings and found only nine pills left in the baggie, according to the complaint.\nThe complaint says G.G. told the NCIS agents that Szramowski had \"admitted to her in person that he gave A.N. the fentanyl-laced pills, but he claimed, 'it wasn't [his] fault' because he 'told [A.N.] the pills were different,' implying that A.N. had fair warning of the lethal nature of the pills he had purchased from Szramowski.\"\nNCIS performed a forensic extraction of A.N.'s cell phone, which they say turned up numerous messages between him and Szramowski in which they \"regularly discussed drug use and drug sales - including 'perc[s],' 'coca,' 'coke,' 'blow,' 'vics,' 'hydrocodone,' 'lsd,' 'shrooms,' and 'ecstasy,'\" the complaint states. \"They also occasionally filmed themselves using drugs.\"\nAgents also reviewed A.N.'s CashApp account records, and located the $100 payment to Szramowski for the pills on which he allegedly ODed, according to the complaint.\nSzramowski is facing one count of distribution of fentanyl resulting in death. If convicted, he faces a prison sentence of 20 years to life.\n"

Within the report, each risk is assigned a risk score metric to help global supply chain leaders prioritize planning and mitigation efforts this year. The following key risks are scored and evaluated: climate change/weather, geopolitical instability, cybercrime, rare metals/minerals and the crackdown on forced labor.\n\"The past year has been unprecedented, with extreme weather events, heightened geopolitical tension and cybercrime destabilizing supply chains throughout the world. Navigating this year's looming risks to build a secure supply network has never been more critical,\" said Corey Rhodes, CEO Everstream Analytics. \"As companies look to prepare their operations for the new year, Everstream's Annual Risk Report gives precise insight into the top risks threatening logistics, suppliers and their networks. While some risks are unavoidable, early notice and swift action through a combination of planning, deep monitoring and mitigation can save inventory and lives in 2025.\"\nDrowning in Climate Change - 90% Risk Score\nDriven by shifting climate patterns and record-high temperatures, extreme weather events are a dominant risk to the supply chain. The Annual Risk Report, highlights the key weather concerns for supply chain leaders, including:\n* Flooding: Volatile flooding has the potential for deep disruption, and the capability to destroy nations with the most sophisticated weather warning systems and infrastructure. Companies will be upended by even more frequent small-scale events, in addition to those of a larger scale.\n* State of Ocean Temperatures: All indications point to the state of ocean temperatures being elevated in 2025 and beyond, with the potential for record-breaking highs. This will result in more frequent and disruptive flood events.\nGeopolitical Instability with Increased Tariff Risk - 80% Risk Score\nIn 2025, global supply chains face geopolitical threats that could disrupt trade networks and impact economies worldwide, including logistics, transportation and manufacturing industries. The following major geopolitical events are likely to impact global trade:\n* Red Sea Disruptions: Ongoing attacks on cargo and container ships continue to lead to longer transit created_ats and equipment imbalance.\n* Russia-Ukraine Conflict: Continued conflict in Ukraine could destabilize manufacturing and trade activities, putting European economies at further risk.\nTaiwan Trade Risks: Increased Chinese military drills near Taiwan could hinder trade through major sea routes, affecting global container shipping flows.\n* Middle East Tensions: Escalating conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza are already disrupting logistics operations, risking infrastructure damage and worker shortages.\n* South China Sea Disputes: Disputes between China and neighboring countries could result in vessel skirmishes, jeopardizing maricreated_at trade routes.\n* Proposed Tariff Increases: The automotive, semiconductor, and manufacturing industries are particularly at risk due to proposed tariffs by the new U.S. government as well as potential retaliatory measures by other countries.\nMore Backdoors for Cybercrime - 75% Risk Score\nSupply chain leaders face escalating cybersecurity risks in 2025, driven by the growing reliance on AI, IoT devices and interconnected systems. The report outlines the most critical supply chain cybersecurity risks, particularly for the manufacturing and electronics industries. These risks include:\n* Increased Back Door Access for Cybercrime: Growing reliance on AI and cloud computing within supply chains is creating new \"back door\" opportunities for bad actors. They are capitalizing on the proliferation of IoT-connected devices, coupled with the widespread use of outdated security protocols and improperly configured firewalls, providing ample entry points for cyberattacks.\n* Vulnerabilities in Sub-tier Supply Chains: In 2025, cyberattacks will primarily arrive via sub-tier supply chains where criminals can more easily exploit common programming errors and vulnerabilities, allowing them to leapfrog into organizations via phishing, software connection links or other methods.\n* Impact on Logistics and Transportation: Third-party logistics providers (3PLs) will be disproportionately impacted by ongoing cyber threats compared to transit hubs like cargo ports and airports.\n* Electronics Industry at Critical Risk Levels: The electronics industry experienced a surge of vulnerabilities within its internal systems in 2024 and these are expected to continue. In the coming year, electronics companies will be particularly vulnerable to data breaches, ransomware attacks and phishing.\nRare Metals and Minerals on Lockdown - 65% Risk Score\nBetween rising regulations, new tariffs and long-term or exclusive contracts, rare minerals and metals will be harder than ever, and more expensive, to obtain. Key findings include:\n* New Tariffs and Sanctions on Critical Metals: Within a politically charged atmosphere between the West and the major commodity producers - China and Russia - companies will face new tariffs and sanctions on critical metals. Governments are placing renewed emphasis on the negative environmental and social impacts of mining, which will present challenges for metal producers over the coming year.\n* Concerns Over Lack of Alternative Suppliers: China could impose broader export restrictions, highlighting the need for supply chain managers to diversify sourcing strategies. This lack of supplier diversity could complicate procurement, lead to supply shortages and could make the price of affected commodities particularly vulnerable to trade tensions and eventual tariffs or sanctions.\nCrackdown on Forced Labor - 60% Risk Score\nA growing crackdown on forced labor across industries will increase pressure on companies who are facing scrutiny to manage and eliminate suppliers violating human rights. Anticipated risks in 2025 include:\n* Push for Alternative Suppliers: Rising levels of concern surrounding labor conditions in China and the country's ongoing geopolitical rivalry with the U.S. have pushed many companies to find alternative suppliers in India, Mexico and other Southeast Asian countries. However, many of these emerging economies do not have adequate laws or enforcement mechanisms for workers.\n* Increase in Legislation: A cascade of legislation has been created that aims to address the lax forced labor issues in America, Europe, Mexico and Canada. Other countries are expected to follow suit this year, as they consider legislation or strengthening existing regulations on forced labor.\n* Challenges Remain for Agri-Food Sector: The global concentration of commodities such as palm oil (83%) and vanilla (92%) originate from countries frequently cited for modern slavery. Companies may face challenges abiding by forced labor regulations, given the prevalence in the agri-food industry,\nFor the full breakdown of insights, analysis, and prescriptive recommendations from Everstream Analytics, download a copy of the 2025 Annual Risk Report, here.\nAbout Everstream Analytics:\nEverstream Analytics sets the global supply chain standard.

    "title": "‘Trump Is at His Absolute Worst in a Crisis’: Three Columnists Imagine the World Ahead; David French, Lydia Polgreen and Bret Stephens",
    "created_at": "2025-01-08",
    "text": "\nPatrick Healy, the deputy Opinion editor, hosted an online conversation with the created_ats Opinion columnists David French, Lydia Polgreen and Bret Stephens about the biggest risks and challenges facing America in the world today and the leadership of President Biden and Donald Trump.\nPatrick Healy: President Biden is about to hand back national security and foreign policy to Donald Trump, and the president-elect is already musing about taking Greenland and the Panama Canal by military force. Trump has big notions about America’s place in the world, and that’s where I want to start.\nWe started the new year with the truck attack in New Orleans by an Army veteran who had an ISIS flag. You have hostages and fighting still in Gaza, and a new Ukrainian offensive in Kursk. The Biden team portrays the world as safer than when the president took office, while Trump sees a world in chaos and is promising order and peace while making a lot of threats to other countries. Let’s start with a base-line question: Do you think America is stronger and more secure in the world today than it was four years ago?\nBret Stephens: The fault doesn’t lie with the Biden administration alone, but it’s hard to argue that President Biden leaves office with the world safer than he found it.\nIran, China, Russia and North Korea now form a new axis of repression and cooperate in ways that were hard to imagine a few years ago. NATO has a couple of new members and is spending a bit more on defense, but the war in Ukraine is not going well, in part because of the administration’s reluctance to supply it with the arms it needed when it needed them. China’s threatening behavior toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea has gone from bad to worse. And Islamist terrorism may be resurgent. The one bright spot is the weakening of Iran and its proxies in the last few months, but that was brought about not by the administration but by Israel’s military successes — achieved often in the face of Biden’s opposition.\nLydia Polgreen: One thing that strikes me about the Biden administration and this era in the world is the element of surprise and seeming unpreparedness. There was the Afghanistan withdrawal, which really weakened Biden. But I also think of the comment by the national security adviser Jake Sullivan about the “quieter” Middle East just a week before Oct. 7, 2023, and then the total failure of the administration to influence Benjamin Netanyahu’s prosecution of the war in Gaza. And now we have the seeming surprise at the stunningly rapid fall of the Assad regime in Syria. Perhaps the best way to achieve strength and security is to anticipate, influence and shape global events in the interests of the United States. And on that score I think we have had a pretty lousy four years.\nStephens: Lydia makes an important point about the administration’s repeated unpreparedness, which I wrote about in my latest column — Biden offering assurances that the Taliban wouldn’t quickly overrun Afghanistan, and his 2021 claim that the uptick in migration across the southern border was merely part of a seasonal pattern. These were the sorts of analytical errors that ultimately helped cost him his presidency.\nDavid French: I think two things are true at once — America’s key enemies are weaker than they were four years ago, and the world is more dangerous. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Hamas’s attack on Israel triggered two wars that have increased instability and geopolitical risks. The war in Ukraine in particular represents a failure of deterrence.\nAt the same created_at, neither war has gone the way the aggressors wanted, in part because of the Biden administration’s responses. Russia has taken enormous losses in men and equipment, and its economy is struggling. Yes, Russia is putting Ukraine under significant pressure on the battlefield, but it’s safe to say that Vladimir Putin never expected his invasion to cost this much.\nIran has suffered the most severe defeats. Hezbollah — its most potent proxy army — has been decimated. The Assad regime has collapsed. Hamas is a shell of its former self. And the vaunted Iranian ballistic missile arsenal has proved ineffective (at least so far).\nHealy: How do you see Biden in all of this, David?\nFrench: The Biden administration has played a role in all these developments. It deployed considerable military force to blunt two separate Iranian attacks on Israel — a direct military intervention that not only exposed Iranian weaknesses, but also signaled that differences over strategy and tactics were not creating a rift in the alliance.\nI have many disagreements with the Biden administration’s approach. He should have provided more weapons to Ukraine, sooner, and with fewer restrictions on their use, for example. But in both Ukraine and the Middle East his approach has been directionally correct. America has stood behind its allies.\nPolgreen: Patrick, you mentioned New Orleans, and there has been some concern about the re-emergence of extremist terrorism, especially with the fall of Assad in Syria. But I am also concerned about the Las Vegas truck explosion. One potent source of violence in the United States is actually our own veterans. There was a fascinating A.P. investigation in October about the rising tide of radicalization among veterans. This can certainly be expressed, as it was in New Orleans, by support for foreign terrorist groups.\nBut much more common is homegrown extremism. Coupled with veterans’ disproportionately high rates of death by suicide, domestic violence and serious mental distress, these events do not make me feel especially great about Pete Hegseth, who has fiercely defended American soldiers accused of horrific war crimes. Veterans who serve our country deserve much better.\nFrench: Hegseth is a culture warrior, and more culture war is the last thing the military needs. You don’t cure a radicalization problem in the military by putting a radical in charge of the Pentagon.\nThe political conversation about military life is pretty far downstream from actual military life. If you’re walking into the Pentagon thinking the way to improve morale or to increase recruitment is to wage war on “wokeness,” then you’re demonstrating that you don’t quite understand the problem. Service members are straining under the burden of frequent deployments and extremely high-tempo operations. Military bureaucracy can be maddening. And recruits are often suffering from many of the same mental health issues that plague so many of their civilian peers.\nStephens: Yes. But it’s important to note that defense spending as a percentage of our G.D.P. was around 3.3 percent in 2023, close to a historic low and down from 5.7 percent in 1985. Ships aren’t being maintained or built fast enough, the Air Force is a shadow of its Cold War self, and our nuclear weapons infrastructure is decrepit. And wokeness — or the perception of it — is a factor, at least to the extent that it partly explains persistent recruiting shortfalls in all the services. Meanwhile, the nature of warfare is changing in ways that no longer match the expensive and exquisite weapons systems we keep buying. If we’re really in a new Cold War against autocracies, we need to arm ourselves adequately to deter them.\nHealy: I want to turn to the challenges and opportunities that the Trump team has in foreign policy and national security. You three may disagree with me, but President-elect Trump seems to be setting expectations that he will get the hostages released in Gaza imminently and Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to do a deal on the future of Ukraine. So for starters: What do you like and dislike about Trump’s approach to the world in his second term?\nFrench: I like the Trump team’s hard line against Iran. While Trump has had a tendency to flatter dictators in Russia, North Korea and China, he’s long held firm against Iran. The assassination of its intelligence chief Qassim Suleimani was one of Trump’s most significant national security achievements.\nThe dislikes are easy to state, beginning with Ukraine. It’s unclear how he can achieve anything like an immediate peace unless he somehow coerces Ukraine into accepting defeat. Russia is taking terrible losses, but it’s making battlefield gains, and it’s unclear whether Putin is willing to make a single meaningful concession to achieve peace. I’m also quite concerned about Trump’s approach to China. His flip-flop on banning TikTok is instructive. He went from a sensible, shrewd policy to naïve acceptance of Chinese access and influence, seemingly in large part because of pure perceived political self-interest.\nStephens: I agree with David. Trump has never been the savvy deal-maker he imagines himself to be, and there’s a real risk he’ll get sucked into deals — including a bad nuclear deal with Iran and a bad cease-fire deal in Ukraine — that may play well with the more isolationist parts of his base but are bad for U.S. interests and worse for our allies. Narcissism is a bad basis for foreign policy, to say nothing of life.\nHealy: I think narcissism is partly driving these rants by Trump about Greenland and the Panama Canal. He likes seeing himself as an all-powerful leader who thinks big, and men like Biden as figureheads who don’t know how to use power.\nStephens: Trump does have four potential advantages over Biden. First, our adversaries fear him in ways I don’t think they feared Biden, who was nothing if not cautious and often slow. That’s the long-term benefit of something like the Suleimani assassination: The Iranians don’t know his red lines. Second, he’s post-ideological, meaning what he lacks in consistency he adds in pragmatism. Third, his skepticism of some of our historic alliances and his threats to pull out of NATO might help to achieve their intended effect, which is to get our allies to actually start paying their fair share for their defense. Fourth, he recognizes the need to spend a whole lot more on defense.\nPolgreen: I’d love for someone to define Trump’s approach for me. Is there a Trump doctrine? “Peace through strength” is perhaps how those who want to put a brave face on it might put it. But I think Trump often confuses “what I like and admire” — strong men doing strongman things — with what is in America’s best interests. There is a profound narcissism to this approach. Does this guy care about anything but looking tough?\nHealy: He likes doing “big” deals like the Abraham Accords (even if he’s not as savvy as he thinks, as Bret noted), he thinks with one eye on the history books (moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem), and he thinks of himself as a turnaround artist who can, say, flip Putin and Kim Jong-un into productive relationships (which didn’t happen). But to your point, Lydia, I don’t think that adds up to a coherent doctrine beyond strutting the world stage with a combination of confidence, hypocrisy and a gambler’s instinct for bluffing. It all adds up to “Brace for impact!”\nPolgreen: One of the most accurate measures of power is the ability to get away with hypocrisy. And at this, Trump is a master. He has been able to shape events to his benefit — just look at how he has turned the entire narrative about Jan. 6 on its head. It might work on low-information American voters. But like David and Bret, I am skeptical it will pass muster when he is speaking to the likes of Xi Jinping and Putin. It seems quite clear he will exchange long-term interests for a short-term political “win,” beginning in Ukraine but surely elsewhere as well.\nHealy: What do you see as one or two of the biggest challenges facing Trump in keeping America strong and safe in the world? And then we’ll talk about opportunities.\nPolgreen: Last fall I wrote about the BRICS summit in Russia, and the profound opportunity successive American presidents have missed to lead an opening up of the international system to be more inclusive of rising powers. The old system was clearly crumbling in a changing world, and the U.S. had the chance to shape a new system with its leadership. I think Trump may be the final nail in the coffin for any American-led effort to bring rising powers into a fairer and more equitable rules-based order. The dangers are profound for a weaker United States in a more Balkanized, multipolar system in which it is merely one of many players grubbing for influence.\nFrench: I do wonder if the foreign perception of Trump has changed a bit — from “unpredictable” to “manipulable.” To return to the TikTok example again, China has now seen how easily Trump changed his mind on a consequential national security decision. Money and flattery go a long way with Donald Trump.\nGive him a “deal” that he can trumpet, and the exact details won’t matter to Trump all that much. Bret and Lydia have both appropriately identified the withdrawal from Afghanistan as a low point for the Biden administration, but we can’t forget that Trump’s terrible agreement with the Taliban set the stage for disaster. Neither president covered himself in glory in Afghanistan.\nPolgreen: It is such a good point, David, and underscores how what looks like a win in the short term can be a profound loss in the long term.\nStephens: Blame for the Afghanistan withdrawal goes to Trump for negotiating a bad deal and to Biden for executing it.\nBut to your question, Patrick, the great global challenge for Trump — and probably for the next several administrations — will be managing the relationship with China in a way that deters its imperialistic ambitions while avoiding all-out war. That’s going to require many things: a stronger U.S. Navy, particularly when it comes to undersea warfare; continued alliance-building with longstanding partners like Japan, Australia and India and new(ish) ones like Vietnam; tough measures against China’s theft of intellectual property, its hacks of government data, and its intimidation of ethnic Chinese living abroad; and also some opportunities for engagement and détente. Trump’s promised trade war takes us in the wrong direction, assuming he’s serious about it and it’s not just a negotiating tactic.\nHealy: And what do you see as opportunities that Trump has to strengthen America’s place in the world?\nStephens: The most urgent crisis in the world right now is the prospect of Iran crossing the nuclear threshold — not necessarily by fielding a bomb but simply by acquiring all of the capabilities it needs to do so in a way that we cannot stop by force or diplomacy. That’s going to have the Trump administration’s attention on Day 1. Tehran had better have a really credible diplomatic offer the next day or it will find themselves at war, probably with Israel but possibly also with us.\nFrench: Trump’s most immediate opportunity is in the Middle East. Israel’s military victories — combined with the fall of the Assad regime in Syria — have left Iran weaker than it’s been in decades. This is exactly the created_at to press to end Iran’s nuclear ambitions.\nI agree with Bret that Iran may choose to rush to the nuclear threshold, but it’s arguably more vulnerable than it’s been at any created_at this century. It is in no position to dictate terms to America or to Israel.\nPolgreen: I keep thinking of things then waving them away — they all seem in the realm of fantasy, not reality. Could Trump play the same role in Sudan’s current brutal civil war that George W. Bush played in the last one? Might he be Nixon-in-China but in the Middle East, midwifing a Palestinian state through a Saudi deal? Nah. I don’t think so.\nHealy: To borrow a phrase from Don Rumsfeld, we’ve been talking so far about some of the known knowns and known unknowns. What are the unknown unknowns in the world that keep you up at night? Or that give you some hope?\nStephens: I really worry about Europe, where long-term economic and demographic decline is matched with the rise of extremist parties, some with not-so-secret affinities for Moscow. On the other hand, it’s not out of the question to see Iran’s theocratic regime falling, particularly if the country loses its nuclear card amid an economic crisis that reignites the sorts of protests we saw in 2022. That would be a blessing for global security, to say nothing for the Iranian people. I have similar, if more far-fetched hopes, about the dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.\nHealy: Bret, is there any leader in Europe who impresses you?\nStephens: Greece’s economic resurrection under the conservative government of Kyriakos Mitsotakis should be a model to other small countries mired in debt and low growth. And Italy’s Giorgia Meloni has been a pleasant surprise. Otherwise, Europe’s principal leaders — Keir Starmer in Britain, Emmanuel Macron in France, Olaf Scholz in Germany — are a Who’s Who of Not Much.\nPolgreen: I worry about another global catastrophe requiring any kind of international cooperation. Estimates indicate Covid killed at least 20 million people across the globe, and the United States had the highest known toll, some 1.2 million. It has become fashionable to describe the response to Covid as an overreaction, and I’m not going to get into that debate here. But next created_at it will be worse, especially with Trump in the White House.\nFrench: I’m going to agree with Lydia. As we watched during the pandemic, Trump is at his absolute worst in a crisis. He was both malicious and incompetent. We definitely need to give Trump credit for Operation Warp Speed, but in so many other ways, Trump failed test after test in 2020. His response to the pandemic divided Americans and diminished the effectiveness of the public health response. His response to the death of George Floyd and the protests helped rip the scab of a host of old American wounds, and his response to a close electoral loss almost plunged America into constitutional chaos.\nHe is not a man who is ready to meet important and dangerous moments.\nHealy: A lightning round. What do you think Trump’s biggest impact in international relations or national security will be in 2025?\nFrench: I’m most interested in the immediate impacts in the active battlefields in the Middle East and Ukraine. We’ll see two very different approaches to two American allies — Israel will enjoy a far more free hand, while Ukraine may find its options narrowed to the point of a strategic crisis.\nPolgreen: Given the state of the world and the F.B.I.’s vital role in investigating and preventing terror attacks, you have got to worry about Kash Patel demolishing the bureau with his witch hunts.\nStephens: Israel will win its wars with Trump’s blessing and material support. Hamas’s leaders will be destroyed in Gaza or exiled from it. Hezbollah will not be able rearm itself to threaten its neighbors. That’s a good thing for everyone, not least for ordinary Palestinians and Lebanese suffering under terrorist rulers. Hopefully, a peace deal between Jerusalem and Riyadh might soon follow.\nHealy: Which world leader will have the greatest unexpected consequence in 2025, and why?\nPolgreen: I am not sure this is unexpected, but it has been astonishing to watch Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey over the past two years. The disastrous earthquakes in 2023 seemed like a death knell for his long years in power, but he is stronger than ever in some ways, and in the catbird seat with Syria.\nStephens: Javier Milei in Argentina. If his shock reforms succeed — and early signs on inflation and the Argentine peso are good — it might change all of Latin America for the better.\nFrench: Italy’s Meloni could have an interesting role to play. She’s reportedly friendly with both Trump and Elon Musk, and she’s a stalwart supporter of Ukraine. That’s an unusual combination, and she is likely to have Trump’s ear more than most European leaders.\nHealy: Which leadership vacuum will matter most in 2025 — Syria, Germany or Canada?\nStephens: Canada, definitely. If Ottawa falls, can Gatineau be far behind?\nOK, I’m kidding. The real leadership vacuum I’m worried about is in my home country, Mexico. It isn’t at all clear to me that Claudia Sheinbaum, the new president, is anything more than a mouthpiece for her pernicious predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, whose twin legacies are the erosion of Mexican democracy and the narco-domination of much of the country.\nFrench: I’m more concerned about a different country entirely — South Korea. We’re still learning the details of Yoon Suk Yeol’s misbegotten attempt to declare martial law, but that degree of instability in a key American ally is profoundly disturbing. It’s hard to imagine an effective strategy to counter China or North Korea without a stable South Korea.\nPolgreen: I am going to cheat and say that the biggest vacuums are actually regional and metaphorical. As Bret said earlier, Europe is basically leaderless, given what is unfolding in France and Germany, and the broad turn away from Brussels and toward more nationalist populist parties. In the Middle East you have a huge vacuum in Syria and Lebanon alongside a group of leaders vying for primacy — Erdogan in Turkey, Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia, Mohamed bin Zayed in the United Arab Emirates, not to mention Netanyahu in Israel. There’s a fierce contest playing out in Latin America between versions of the right — Nayib Bukele in El Salvador and Milei — and the left — Sheinbaum and an aging Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil.\nBut the most important vacancy, I think, is for the leader of the free world as we have long understood it. In an age of conflicts over migration, climate, territory, religion, culture, economics — who will emtext an ethos of moving the world forward in some semblance of peace and prosperity? Since World War II the president of the United States has claimed this role, but Trump seems to have a very different vision for America and the world.\nHealy: Antony Blinken gave an interview to our newsroom colleague Lulu Garcia-Navarro in which he argued that he and President Biden generally made the right calls in office. Briefly, what’s a right call that they made, and what’s a wrong call?\nFrench: The decision to support Ukraine is the most consequential correct decision Biden has made, even if the execution has been flawed. But we also shouldn’t overlook the decision to use military force to defend Israel from Iranian missile attack. Had Iran inflicted serious damage on Israel, the world would be far more dangerous and unstable than it is now.\nThere’s no need to think hard about Biden’s worst call — the decision to abandon Afghanistan was deeply flawed in both strategy and execution. We never should have left.\nPolgreen: As David says, there are decisions, and then there is the actual nuance of execution. Help Ukraine defend itself, yes, good decision. But how to be effective? Help Israel respond to a vicious terrorist attack, absolutely. But failing to prevent the horrific and avoidable slaughter in Gaza, with American weapons, was a catastrophic mistake.\nStephens: Supporting Ukraine and Israel were the big right calls, even if the execution was often wanting. I’d also give the administration a lot of credit for some of the quiet but important diplomacy in Asia. AUKUS, the trilateral nuclear submarine deal with Australia and the U.K., was an important achievement. So were the U.S.-mediated reconciliation efforts between Japan and South Korea, and Japan and the Philippines. And I’d even give credit to Biden for repeatedly insisting that the U.S. would defend Taiwan militarily if it were attacked by China, even if his aides tried to walk that back.\nFrench: I’m glad you brought up AUKUS, Bret. That was an important achievement that will have very real national security benefits.\nHealy: Final question — a lot of world leaders are curious about what kind of America they will get under President Trump in the next four years. What would you tell them?\nFrench: Trump’s second victory should be a signal to the world: Don’t think of Trump’s relative isolationism as a phase that will soon pass, but as perhaps a harbinger of an enduring change in American temperament. If your strategy for international stability depends on American leadership, it’s created_at to consider a Plan B.\nPolgreen: When I get the chance to meet world leaders, I try to listen more than talk. But there is a strain of tremendous global resentment toward American leadership, and I would imagine a profound sense of relief among many world leaders that the United States is led by someone who doesn’t pretend it is about anything but self-interest. I don’t think that bodes particularly well for the rest of us ordinary folk, who have to live in this complicated, interconnected world.\nStephens: It’s too soon to give into despair. The next four years are going to be disruptive. Some of it will be foolish and some of it will be just noise. But we’re in a world in which the status quo has been failing for some created_at, and some of the disruption is long overdue.

It departed Port Klang, Malaysia last week after a port call in Kuala Lumpur.\nThe flagship of Carrier Strike Group One is \"underway conducting routine operations in the US Pacific Fleet 7th Fleet area of operations,\" according to photos released by the US Pacific Fleet on Thursday, January 9. The U.S. 7th Fleet's area of operations cover the Indo-Pacific region.\nThe 1,092-foot vessel can carry up to 90 aircraft and hosts more than 5,000 personnel, including its crew and air wing.\nThe presence of the US aircraft carrier comes amid escalating tensions between Manila and Beijing after China's largest Coast Guard vessel spent four days meandering in the waters off Zambales, within the Philippines' 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) on Wednesday, January 8 said that the so-called monster ship by China had already began to sail away, last spotted 90 nautical miles from Zambales' coastline. But another CCG vessel appears to have taken its place, the PCG said.\nWhile foreign vessels are allowed to pass through the Philippines' EEZ, the PCG on Monday explained that the China monster ship displayed \"erratic movements\" that indicate it is not there for 'innocent passage.'\nBeijing has continued to press its claims to almost the entire South China Sea despite an international tribunal ruling in 2016 that nullified its claim of historic rights over the waters.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-09",
    "text": "\nOn Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that \"Chinese-state sponsored hackers penetrated the executive branch of the Philippines government and stole sensitive data,\" as always, according to three anonymous people \"familiar with the matter.\" The report highlighted that \"the stolen data included military documents, some of which are related to the China and Philippines' ongoing territorial dispute over the South China Sea.\"On Wednesday, the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines opposed the \"unjustified labeling, groundless accusations, or smears campaign\". \"It is worth noting that the report links the hacking to the South China Sea issue and mentions that the United States and others have provided technical support and technology to the Philippines. Who is the mastermind behind this hype farce and who is using cyber issues to stir up the regional situation and seek geopolitical interests? The answer is self-evident,\" Chinese embassy said. \nThe US often relies on spreading misinformation or repeating misleading narratives in the hope that \"a lie told a thousand created_ats becomes the truth.\" The US has developed a formulaic approach to smear China on cyberattack topics: no technical details, no investigative reports, and no credible evidence. According to Bloomberg, anonymous sources claimed that in the attack, \"the hackers used stolen usernames and passwords to access computer networks, install malware, and delete evidence of their presence.\" This raises critical questions: Can the US provide the associated IP addresses of the hackers, explain how the usernames and passwords were stolen, or identify the type of malware used? None of these crucial details are mentioned in the report. Instead, vague and elusive descriptions are presented as though they constitute the \"truth.\" Ding Duo, director of the Research Center for International and Regional Studies at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the Global created_ats that the so-called hacking incident is fundamentally no different from previous US propaganda. It is merely another US' cognitive warfare strategy and part of the US-Philippines \"gray zone\" tactics in the South China Sea.Yang Xiao, deputy director of the Institute of Maricreated_at Strategy Studies at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, said the US has been focusing on the issue of China's alleged cyberattacks primarily to serve its broader anti-China agenda. Now, in order to maintain the momentum of the hype, the US has linked the so-called hacking incident to the South China Sea, aimed at further stoking tensions in the South China Sea and pulling the Philippines deeper into the confrontation.Cyberattacks are becoming a stereotyped tool for the US as well as its allies to target China. Japan on Wednesday linked more than 200 cyberattacks over the past five years targeting the country's national security and high technology data to a Chinese group, according to the Associated Press. Obviously, Japan is playing a supporting role in the US-style political farces. However, the US is the real \"expert\" in global cyberattacks. Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the \"Prism\" scandal, revealed in 2014 that the Philippines is among the countries being secretly monitored by a telecommunications spying program of the US National Security Agency. China is a victim of cyberattacks, not a perpetrator. While the US will likely continue this smear campaign, the international community will see more clearly its ugly double standards and disinformation drive, and it will not disrupt China's progress or development and but will strengthen China's determination to safeguard national security and territorial sovereignty. \n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-09",
    "text": "\n Hundreds of thousands of mostly barefoot Catholic worshippers marched Thursday in an annual procession in the Philippines that venerates a centuries-old black statue of Jesus. Some said they prayed for good health for their families, an end to tensions in the South China Sea, and for incoming U.S. President Donald Trump to be kinder to Filipino immigrants.\nThe procession marks the feast of Jesus Nazareno and is a major annual Catholic event in Asia. The image was previously called the Black Nazarene, but church officials appealed for a change, saying the former name was not founded in history and evoked a racial slur.\nThe procession in Manila began before dawn, with organizers putting the early crowd at around 250,000. Their number swelled later in the day, but there was no immediate updated crowd estimate. Last year, at least 2 million devotees joined the 15-hour procession, with some estimates of the crowd as high as over 6 million.\nGaspar Espinocilla, a 56-year-old Manila city employee and a devotee of Jesus Nazareno for the last 20 years, said he is praying for his family, including his sister who has ovarian cancer. He is also praying for an end to tensions in the West Philippines Sea, a part of the South China Sea claimed by the Philippines, where China has been harassing Filipino fishermen and coast guard vessels.\n\"I hope China will ease up on us, they cannot seize everything as theirs,\" said Gaspar, who was wearing a maroon T-shirt printed with face of Jesus Nazareno. \"It is ours, not theirs.\"\nRenato Reyes, a garbage scavenger who has been a Jesus Nazareno devotee for more than three decades, said he prays for a better life for his family, for the Philippines to be free from calamities, as well as for wars overseas to end. He also said he will include in his prayers Filipinos who may be affected by Trump's planned mass deportation of illegal immigrants.\n\"I hope they will not implement that because our countrymen are there just to earn a living for their families,\" he added.\nThousands of police and plainclothes officers were deployed, along with drone surveillance and commandos positioned on rooftops along the nearly 6-kilometer (3.7 miles) route of the procession. Many nearby roads were closed and cell phone signals were blocked.\nMore than a dozen devotees were seen being carried on stretchers as ambulances were on standby for people who would fall ill.\nThe statue of Jesus carrying the cross was brought to the Philippines from Mexico on a galleon in 1606 by Spanish missionaries. The ship that carried it caught fire, but the charred statue survived, according to some accounts. Church historians, however, said the statue's color owes to the fact that it was carved out of mesquite wood, which darkens as it ages.\nMany devotees believe the statue's endurance, from fires and earthquakes through the centuries and intense bombings during World War II, is a testament to its miraculous powers.\n"

    "title": "Researchers at China University Release New Study Findings on Natural Gas (Genetic types and accumulation models of natural gas in the Weixinan depression of the Beibu Gulf Basin in the western South China Sea)",
    "created_at": "2025-01-09",
    "text": "\n2025 JAN 09 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Life Science Daily -- Fresh data on natural gas are presented in a new report. According to news originating from Wuhan, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Exploration in the Weixinan depression of the Beibu Gulf Basin has long focused on crude oil, with less natural gas exploration, so the genetic types and accumulation characteristics of the natural gas in the depression have not been determined. Therefore, this study explored the geochemical characteristics, origins and sources, filling periods, and migration and accumulation models of natural gas in the Weixinan depression of the Beibu Gulf Basin, based on data on natural gas composition, light hydrocarbon composition, stable carbon isotopes, and fluid inclusions.\" \n Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from China University: \"The results showed that the natural gas in the Weixinan depression is mainly composed of hydrocarbon gases, with methane (CH4) predominating (62 %-96 %, with an average of 78 %). The percentage of heavy hydrocarbon gases (C2-5) is high (average 20 %), and the drying coefficient (C1/C1-5) is generally less than 0.95, indicative of typical wet gas. The carbon isotope ratios of methane (d13C1) range from -51.60 \\x89 to -34.37 \\x89, and the carbon isotope ratios of ethane (d13C2) range from -36.67 \\x89 to -16.53 \\x89, respectively. The carbon isotopes of alkane gases generally show a positive sequence distribution, and a degree of carbon isotopic reversal in natural gas occurs in some well areas. It is speculated that the carbon isotope reversal may be related to the mixing of natural gas from multiple sets of source rocks in the same stage or from the same set of source rocks in different stages. The natural gas is mainly oil-type gas, probably originating from the oil shale in the lower sub-member of the second member of the Liushagang Formation (E2l2l), with some contributions from the shale in the upper sub-member of the third member of the Liushagang Formation (E2l3u). The study area has seen multiple periods of oil and gas filling. The area away from the sub-sags experienced a single, early period of natural gas filling associated with mature crude oil generated during the same period. However, in the zone near the sub-sags, there have been multiple relatively long periods of continuous natural gas filling.\" \n According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Two migration and accumulation models are developed: indirect natural gas filling with no contact between the source rocks and the reservoirs in the zone away from the sub-sags, and continuous natural gas filling with the source rocks in direct contact with the reservoirs in the zone near the sub-sags. The results revealed the genetic types and reservoir characteristics of the natural gas in the Weixinan depression, which is crucial for decision-making for the next step of natural gas exploration.\" \n For more information on this research see: Genetic types and accumulation models of natural gas in the Weixinan depression of the Beibu Gulf Basin in the western South China Sea.

    "text": "\n 09 Jan 2025 (Philippines News agency) The Philippine government on Thursday urged countries in the Asia Pacific states to strengthen maricreated_at cooperation and develop 'confidence-building measures' in the region against the backdrop of tensions in the South China Sea.\nSpeaking at an ISEAS (Institute of Southeast Asian Studies)- Yusof Ishak Institute forum in Singapore, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo said the region must promote cooperative activities in the maricreated_at realm, including along the lines of maricreated_at domain awareness (MDA) and marine environment protection, with the international law as a guide.\nBeyond defense-oriented security tie-ups, the Filipino top diplomat said maricreated_at cooperation could enable states to define 'new by-ways for responsible shared stewardship' of the sea.\n'And especially because of the tensions and disputes in the South China Sea, it is incumbent upon the region's members to push the frontiers for possible maricreated_at cooperation,' he said.\nOn top of MDA and environment protection, Manalo said countries could cooperate in areas concerning the safety of navigation and communication at sea, ocean governance, natural resource extractions, and fisheries.\nIn the same forum, he encouraged the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China to 'persevere in delivering a credible and effective' Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea that is anchored on international law.\n'This is especially important because not only of the global significance of the South China Sea to international trade and commerce, but also due to the continuing disputes and tension in the South China Sea,' he said.\nThe official noted that actions against lawful activities within the South China Sea, including against the Philippine patrols in its exclusive economic zones 'have added even more urgency to this issue of the COC'.\nTalks on crafting a COC have been ongoing since 2018 after its framework was adopted and endorsed by the leaders of China and the ASEAN.\nMeanwhile, Manalo underscored the effectiveness of global and regional cooperation-in new fronts and on new platforms-notwithstanding major power rivalries.\n'These created_ats of global unrest behoove our region, the Asia Pacific, to fulfill its promise as the engine of global growth for this century. And to this end, we must build for peace to sustain our economic growth trajectories and secure the inclusive empowerment of our citizens,' he said.\n"

    "text": "\nchinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2025-01-09 19:48\nThat outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrapped up his last tour to the Asia-Pacific region with a back-to-back visit to the Republic of Korea and Japan, skipping the Philippines, might explain the tranquility in the South China Sea these days, however temporary it may be.\nThe ROK and Japan's honeymoon with the Joe Biden administration climaxed during a trilateral summit in Camp David in August 2023. And the Philippines also enjoyed such a highlight moment when a similar summit was held in Washington attended by the Philippine leader along with his US and Japanese counterparts in April.\nSo, with the Philippines being the only country among the three close US allies in the region that has not seen a recent change in its leadership, that the Biden administration still chose to omit the Philippines in the itinerary of its top diplomat's farewell visit to the Asia-Pacific must have rubbed insult into Manila's wound.\nIt highlights the Philippines' expendable position in the US' alliance network in the Asia-Pacific region. When the US evaluates the importance of its allies, which are classified into different classes, priority is given to those that share its \"values\", boast economic and high-tech prowess, and occupy strategic geopolitical positions.\nThe only value the Philippines has to the US lies in its geographical location overlooking the South China Sea and the waters south to China's Taiwan island. And that value naturally disappears when the Sino-US relationship is thriving.\nSo the quietness in the South China Sea, to some extent, reflects the Ferdinand Marcos Jr government's awakening to the bitter fact that despite the Philippines' selfless sacrifice to avail the US advancing its anti-China strategy on its doorstep — both the ROK and Japan have kept a more pragmatic China policy than the Philippines — it is a deserted piece.\nSome Western media outlets recently reported that Chinese State-backed hackers hacked into Philippine government departments and stole sensitive data as part of a yearslong operation. This is a total lie fabricated just to goad the near-hibernating Marcos government to carry on its fool's errand.\nAs the Chinese embassy in the Philippines said in a statement in response to the reports, which link the \"hacking\" with the South China Sea issue and expose the external assistance available to Manila to that end,\"Who is the mastermind behind this farce and who is using cyber issues to stir up regional tensions and seek geopolitical gains? The answer is self-evident.\"\nAt the same created_at, some US think tanks have sought to spur the Marcos government to keep on its momentum to continuously provoke China in the South China Sea.\nRaymond Powell, the director of SeaLight, a project of Stanford University's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, suggested the Philippine military invite its US counterpart to undertake humanitarian operations in the disputed waters, or a Philippine company partner with a US company for oil exploration, to increase the pressure on Beijing.\nPowell's suggestions expose the US side's disappointment with Manila's failure to provoke China to take tough measures against it, if not the success of Beijing's South China Sea policy that prioritizes dialogue to resolve differences.\nChina, as well as other regional countries, have been well aware that it will only be a matter of created_at before Manila has to accept it is being caught in a dilemma of its own making on the South China Sea issue. That explains Beijing's restraint and the cold shoulders the other Southeast Asian countries have given to Manila's invitation for them to join it in playing the US' Asia-Pacific game.\nGiven the in-your-face \"America first\" stance the incoming US leader displayed in a pre-inauguration news conference on Tuesday, it should not be beyond expectation that the Marcos government will be pressed to pay for the privilege of being the US' pawn.\nManila has never been in a position to ask what the US can do for the Philippines, it has always been in the position of asking what the Philippines can do for the US.\nIf it hopes that it will get some quid for its quo from the new US administration, it is set to be disappointed. There will be a steep demand for quo even for the slightest quid.\n"

    "text": "\n 09 Jan 2025 (BERNAMA News Agency) Malaysia aims to use its strong ties with China to foster closer relations between ASEAN countries and the Asian giant during its chairmanship of ASEAN this year, said Defence Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin.\nHe said while overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea pose challenges, Malaysia is confident it can guide ASEAN nations to avoid conflict with China.\n'Yes, we accept the fact that there are challenges; there are overlapping areas, and there are issues and problems in the South China Sea. But I think diplomacy is also there.\n'I think most of the countries within ASEAN accept the fact that China is our neighbour. It is a big country, strong economically and technologically advanced. We have to live with China,' he said.\nMohamed Khaled said this as a panellist at the Malaysia Economic Forum session titled ASEAN Dynamics: Capitalising on Opportunities and Navigating Transition at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre today.\nMohamed Khaled emphasised that Malaysia does not view military action as an approach to resolving the South China Sea disputes although it remains committed to bolstering its defence capabilities in the region.\n'We must strengthen our military so we will be respected. But it is not the answer to all our problems,' he said.\nTo address the ongoing disputes, Mohamed Khaled said Malaysia is employing two key strategies: maintaining a visible presence in all overlapping claim areas and enhancing maricreated_at domain awareness to ensure Malaysians are informed about the territories that the country claims.\nHe also hopes that during Malaysia's ASEAN chairmanship, significant progress will be made in finalising the South China Sea Code of Conduct (COC) to preserve peace and stability in the region.\nMeanwhile, Mohamad Khaled said that although Malaysia is a partner country in BRICS, it will not abandon its traditional trading partners, such as the United States, the European Union and others.\nHe said that joining BRICS provides Malaysia with access to larger and emerging markets, as the alliance represents 45 per cent of the world's population and 28 per cent of the global economy, a potential Malaysia cannot afford to overlook.\n'We are not abandoning dollar-based trading and transactions. We are not dismantling anything,' he said.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippines has deployed vessels and aircraft to closely monitor a gigantic Chinese coast guard ship - the world's largest - in waters off Luzon island, Filipino officials said, describing the ship as a menacing presence in its exclusive economic zone.\nThe 12,000-ton China Coast Guard vessel 5901, known as The Monster for its sheer size, was last seen on Saturday about 54 nautical miles from Capones, a Philippine island in the South China Sea close to the coast of western Zambales province.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) has been shadowing CCG 5901 and transmitting radio messages asking it to leave Philippine waters, said Jonathan Malaya, assistant director general of the National Security Council.\nObviously, this is an act of intimidation, coercion and aggression against the Philippines, Malaya told a press briefing on Monday.\nWe have all our assets pointed at this monster ship. At the moment it does something bad in the sense that it would provoke actions, there will be appropriate action from the government, Malaya said, without elaborating.\nThe Chinese ship arrived last week at Scarborough Shoal, a disputed South China Sea feature within the Philippines' EEZ, an analyst told Radio Free Asia, a news service affiliated with BenarNews.\nMalaya dismissed a Chinese government statement saying that its vessel was merely conducting a patrol within its jurisdiction.\nChina's embassy in Manila has not responded to media requests for comment, but has repeatedly asserted Beijing's jurisdiction over Scarborough Shoal, also known as Bajo de Masinloc in the Philippines.\nThe shoal, located 125 nautical miles (232 kilometers) from the main Philippine island of Luzon, has been under Beijing's de facto control since 2012. It is claimed by China, the Philippines and Taiwan. The shoal is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino fishermen but Chinese vessels have restricted their access in recent years.\nWhile CCG 5901 has not carried out any dangerous maneuvers so far, Malaya said its activities within Manila's waters were not backed by any international law.\nAnd given that we do not want to be the precursor of any provocative action, we're just monitoring and shadowing it as of now, he said.\nOn Sunday, the Philippine Coast Guard said that one of its ships, the BRP Cabra, and its aircraft were tailing the huge Chinese ship and issuing radio challenges.\nAs of 7 p.m. Monday, the BRP Cabra had kept on the heels of the foreign ship for a third straight day, said Commodore Jay Tarriela, PCG spokesman for the West Philippine Sea - Manila's name for South China Sea waters within its exclusive economic zone.\nCCG 5901's erratic movements indicated that it was not engaged in innocent passage in Philippine waters, but was actually conducting a law enforcement operation in Manila's territorial waters, Tarriela said.\nIn November, Beijing announced baselines of its territorial sea around the Scarborough Shoal to strengthen its claim over the South China Sea feature, a move that Manila rejected.\nLast month, confrontations heated up between Beijing and Manila around the area, with both claimants accusing each other of instigating trouble.\nBeijing said Manila was encroaching in what it claimed as its jurisdiction, forcing it to take measures. The PCG accused its Chinese counterpart of firing a water cannon and of sideswiping a government fisheries ship patrolling the area.\nIn 2012, China took possession of the shoal, forcing the Philippines to file a lawsuit before a world court. Four years later, an international arbitral tribunal ruled in Manila's favor.\nBeijing has refused to acknowledge the ruling.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nLiu said China was willing to deepen military-to-military exchanges and cooperation in various fields. \nLiu also had separate meetings with the Malaysian defence minister and defence forces chief in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday. \nThe two sides exchanged views on regional security, military information and cooperation on training and joint operations, according to Malaysian national news agency Bernama. \nDefence Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin highlighted past dialogue on the management of maricreated_at issues in the South China Sea, and said that such a diplomatic approach would continue to ensure issues between Malaysia and China were properly addressed, Bernama reported. \nLiu is a war hero and China's youngest top general to be named joint chiefs of staff. Malaysia is his first overseas stop since he was promoted to the role in late 2022 at the age of 58. \nHe also sits on the powerful six-member Central Military Commission, the PLA decision-making text chaired by President Xi Jinping. \nLiu has also been involved in high-level diplomacy, including holding an ice-breaking video call in December 2023 with his US counterpart, General Charles Brown. \nThe call marked the resumption of military communication with the United States since Beijing halted all such exchanges after then US House speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August 2022. \nBeijing sees Taiwan as a part of China to be reunited by force if necessary, and with no right to official overseas exchanges. The US is Taiwan's top international backer but, like most countries, does not recognise the self-governed island as an independent state. However, Washington is opposed to any attempt to take Taiwan by force and is committed to arming it for defence. \nLiu also spoke via video link with his Russian counterpart in May 2023 and his British counterpart last May. \nHis visit comes as Malaysia ramps up ties with China with a series of high-level exchanges. \nPrime Minister Anwar has visited China three created_ats since taking office in November 2022, most recently two months ago. Chinese Premier Li Qiang also visited Malaysia in June. \nDuring a meeting with Xi in Beijing in November 2023, Anwar said that the two countries shared \"similar ideas and close positions on many major international and regional issues\". \nXi, for his part, called on both sides to \"enhance political trust and firmly support each other's core interests and major concerns\". \nChina has been Malaysia's top trading partner globally since 2009. However, territorial disputes in the South China Sea are still a complicating factor, although criticism from the Malaysian government is rare. \nBeijing's expansive claims over the resource-rich waters overlap also with Malaysia's fellow Asean members Vietnam, Brunei and the Philippines, a US treaty ally. \nClashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in particular have heightened tensions in the region over the past year. Vietnam has also formally accused Chinese law enforcement personnel of assaulting its fishermen in disputed waters. \nThe Chinese and Malaysian militaries do not hold regular joint drills - the last bilateral exercise was in 2015. Their latest multilateral cooperation included the \"Peace and Friendship\" exercise held in China's southern Guangdong province in 2023, alongside the military forces of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. \nHowever, a Malaysian port call by two PLA Navy ships last October sparked criticism within the country, with the opposition alleging that Malaysia was sending the wrong message to its Asean peers amid the South China Sea tensions. \nThe Malaysian government dismissed the concerns, saying such visits by foreign military ships were a \"normal occurrence\". \n\"We call on all parties not to 'slam the door' but to come together to seek the best solution,\" Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan said. \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "text": "\nOMAR SACHEDINA: Growing tensions tonight along a vital global shipping route. It's where we find CTV's Adrian Ghobrial on board HMCS Ottawa.\nADRIAN GHOBRIAL (Reporter): On the horizon, not one, but two People's Liberation Army Navy vessels shadowing HMCS Ottawa. A hulking destroyer called the Chang Sha, and a warship dubbed Yung Chang. The looming presence of China's Navy comes as no surprise. Over the last decade, Beijing has built air strips on top of South China Sea reefs, and militarized nearby islands with cruise missiles and radar systems. The stakes are high. One third of all global shipping passes through these waters.\nLT TRAVIS VERBEEK (Navigating Officer): We're not going to get too close to cause any kind of risk of contention.\nGHOBRIAL: From the bridge, Lt. Travis Verbeek guides HMCS Ottawa past the nearby Scarborough Shoal, a contested spot that both the Philippines and China have claimed as their own. We can see here, how close we are to the Philippines. They claimed these waters as their exclusive economic zone?\nVERBEEK: Absolutely.\nGHOBRIAL: Verbeek and the crew on board soon find even more ships in our vicinity, a Chinese Coast Guard appearing to close in on a Coast Guard vessel from the Philippines, who then sends out this call over the open radio.\nVERBEEK: The Philippine Coast Guard vessel was calling the Chinese warship, so a PLAN 571, and they were reminding them of their obligations under UNCLOS, the United Nation Convention of Laws of Sea. They were calling to remind them that they're in close proximity to Philippine waters, and remind them that they're a signatory to this convention, and asking them to clarify their intentions within Philippine waters.\nGHOBRIAL: Did we hear a reply from the Chinese Navy?\nVERBEEK: No, there was no reply given back from the Chinese Navy to the Philippine Coast Guard.\nGHOBRIAL: Recent months have seen an escalation in clashes between Chinese and Philippine Coast Guards, from axe swinging, knife wielding fights at sea, to the use of water cannons, and claims by the Philippines of Chinese ships intentionally ramming their vessels. HMCS Ottawa is here on an operation to promote order and calm on the open waters. Though it appears that any hope of peace is at risk of disappearing into the distant horizon. China has claimed ownership of nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, even though a international court ruled back in 2016 that their claim was invalid. As we've seen here on these waters, their military presence is growing. Omar.\nSACHEDINA: Adrian, thank you. Still ahead, we'll take you to the Super Bowl of tech, and into the future.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n"

    "title": "'Robust latticework' of cooperation and partnerships crucial for peace in Asia Pacific: Philippine Foreign Minister",

    "text": "\nSINGAPORE: Securing peace in the Asia Pacific requires a \"robust latticework\" of cooperative mechanisms to navigate the challenges of a \"distinctly different global landscape\", said the Philippines' Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo on Thursday (Jan 9).\nDespite the \"enduring relevance\" of regional blocs such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), at created_ats of global unrest, establishing multilateral, regional, subregional and bilateral dialogues as well as partnerships outside the bloc is also possible, he said.\n\"There is no reason why other multilateral regional dialogues or initiatives complementary to ASEAN or involving ASEAN with others should not be explored,\" Manalo said in his keynote speech at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute Regional Outlook Forum held at Marina Bay Sands convention centre in Singapore.\nThe global unrest Manalo was referring to was the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East as well as the rivalry between US and China.\nIn his keynote address titled \"Can The Spirit of Cooperation Shine Through Turbulent created_ats?\", he emphasised the need to facilitate economic growth by investing in human capital, configuring more resilient and integrated supply chains and strengthening connectivity. Manalo also cited the emergence of new modes of cooperation, as states beyond the global superpowers are actively shaping the regional and global agenda to find solutions in light of their respective realities.\n\"A wave of South-South cooperation has flourished in the past decade by states of similar development tracks to address shared policy challenges,\" the 72-year-old seasoned diplomat from the Philippines said.\n\"India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, among others, have established new development cooperation models outside the funding streams of the West,\" he elaborated.\nIn November 2022, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Cooperation in Regional Payment Connectivity (RPC) was signed between the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand and Indonesia to strengthen and enhance collaboration on payment connectivity through the development of more efficient and inclusive cross-border payments.\nIn April 2024, Brunei and Laos became the latest countries to join the cooperation after Vietnam joined in 2023, bringing the total number of countries to eight.\nManalo highlighted the Philippine-Pacific Health Initiative between the Philippines government and the Pacific island countries as another example of promising multilateral cooperation.\nLaunched in November 2024, the initiative aimed to ensure \"sustainable health resources\" through addressing health workforce shortages in the region. As well as calling for more robust collaborative frameworks, Manalo also emphasised the significance of global and regional organisations such as the United Nations (UN) and ASEAN.\nEven as it strains under the weight of geopolitical tensions, \"the UN is at the heart of global cooperation,\" he said.\n\"Many see the UN as an imperfect vessel for the human community as we navigate through the crisis of our created_ats, but without the UN, the atrocities would be far more devastating.\"\nMeanwhile, at the regional stage, ASEAN symbolises the \"triumph of the will of states for peace and cooperation\".\nASEAN's constructive and inclusive approaches, together with the depth and breadth of its dialogue partnerships, continue to promote various types of cooperation and dialogue among its members and with external partners through platforms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum established in 1994 and the East Asia Summit in 2005.\n\"If ASEAN is stronger than it was created in 1967, and it is undoubtedly stronger, then it is more than ever in a position to drive more dialogue and cooperation in Asia,\" Manalo said at the annual forum which counted policy-makers and academics among its physical and online audience of 550 people. ENHANCING MARIcreated_at COOPERATION\nAn area of critical importance in enhancing cooperation within Asia Pacific, Manalo said, is the governance of global commons, in particular the region's maricreated_at commons.\n\"Our seas and oceans connect our nations as a lifeline ... for the well-being of our economies and the future of millions of our coastal communities,\" he said, adding that the governing of maricreated_at commons is key in maintaining peace in the region.\nHe called for ASEAN states and China to \"persevere\" in delivering a credible and effective code of conduct for the South China Sea, in light of the continuing disputes and tensions surrounding the disputed waters as well as its global significance in international trade and commerce.\n\"Actions against the lawful pursuits of countries such as the Philippines in our exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea which are in accordance with (the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) UNCLOS and Arbitral Award 2016 have added even more urgency to the issue of ongoing maricreated_at cooperation,\" Manalo said.\nHe also cited maricreated_at cooperation initiatives which have emerged through joint exercises involving a number of states that have affirmed the \"sense of responsibility\" in achieving regional peace and security.\nThe Philippines in 2016 pursued a Trilateral Cooperative Arrangement with Indonesia and Malaysia to address maricreated_at security threats in the Sulu and Sulawesi Seas, through launching regular patrols, intelligence sharing and Maricreated_at Coordinating Centres in the three countries. CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE SOUTH CHINA SEA\nASEAN states and China are currently engaged in negotiations on the South China Sea Code of Conduct which was launched in draft form as a basis for negotiation in 2018.\nLast year, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr signed two new laws - the Maricreated_at Zones Act and the Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act - to strengthen his country's maricreated_at claims and bolster its territorial integrity, which China objected to.\nResponding to a question on whether the Code of Conduct, once finalised, will be effective for the Philippines to navigate through its ongoing territorial dispute with China, Manalo said that it \"depends on the outcome of the conduct\".\n\"There are still basic, fundamental questions that have not yet been fully addressed ... What is the scope? What is the relationship of the code to UNCLOS and what is (the code's) relationship with external parties?\" he elaborated further. TRUMP PRESIDENCY\nSpeaking on his country's future relations with Washington in light of Donald Trump's upcoming second presidential term, Manalo appeared to be hopeful, noting that Manila had experience working with Trump during his first presidential term which, according to him, \"went well\".\n\"President Marcos and Trump had a good discussion over the phone and they both reaffirmed the importance of our ties,\" he added, citing the mutual defence treaty between the two countries which has been established for almost 80 years.\nWhen asked whether Trump's return to office might potentially complicate tensions with regards to Taiwan between the US and China, Manalo reiterated the Philippines' position that it should be resolved through \"peaceful means\".\n\"We have hundreds of thousands of Filipinos living and working in Taiwan so we would be directly affected,\" he added.

    "text": "\nCHINA on Tuesday deployed a People's Liberation Army Navy (PLA-N) helicopter to shadow a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessel on a surveillance mission in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nIn a report Wednesday, the PCG said the PLA-N helicopter, identified by tail number 47, hovered above the BRP Cabra that was monitoring the activities of the China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel with bow number 5901, known as \"The Monster\" because of its size.\nThe PCG had previously challenged the legality of the Chinese vessel's operations in the area, asserting that the CCG-5901 had no authority to enforce maricreated_at laws roughly 60 to 70 nautical miles off the coast of Zambales.\nThe PCG said the CCG-5901 had been operating within the Philippine EEZ for four consecutive days without permission, prompting the Philippine vessel to challenge the Chinese ship's presence over radio. This challenge was an assertion of Philippine sovereignty over its waters.\nThe overflight by the PLA-N helicopter further heightened the tense atmosphere. PCG Commandant Adm. Ronnie Gil Gavan instructed his personnel to exercise restraint in light of the provocative actions by the Chinese forces. He emphasized the importance of remaining composed to avoid actions that might escalate the situation further.\nIn an update, the PCG reported that the CCG-5901 had departed the Zambales coastline and was now about 90 nautical miles offshore. In its place, the PCG tracked another Chinese vessel, CCG-3103, which had departed Guangdong Province the day before and was heading towards the previous location of the CCG-5901.\nAt 3 p.m. on Thursday, CCG-3103 was detected by Canada's Dark Vessel Detection system about 60 nautical miles from Pandaquit in Zambales. The proximity of the vessel suggested that it was likely replacing the \"monster ship\" in its unlawful activities in Philippine waters, continuing the CCG's illegal presence within the Philippine EEZ, the PCG said.\nTo monitor the situation closely, the PCG deployed an Islander aircraft to the area. The aircraft confirmed the presence of CCG-3103, which was operating in the waters previously occupied by the \"The Monster.\" Additionally, BRP Cabra was reported to be heading towards the location of CCG-3103, ready to challenge its presence in a bid to assert Philippine territorial rights.\nThe dispute between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea is rooted in conflicting territorial claims. The Philippines asserts its sovereignty over parts of the South China Sea, specifically its EEZ, which is home to vital maricreated_at routes and significant natural resources. \nChina, on the other hand, claims almost the entire South China Sea, marked by the so-called \"nine-dash line,\" a claim that has been widely contested by the international community and debunked by an international arbitration court.\nThe presence of the China Coast Guard vessels, including the CCG-5901, has been a point of tension for years. The ship, nicknamed \"The Monster\" due to its size and power, has become a symbol of China's assertiveness in the disputed waters. Its actions, including the recent unlawful presence in Philippine waters, have drawn condemnation from the Philippines, which continues to challenge China's aggressive expansionist tactics.\nThe Philippine government has consistently protested the Chinese incursions, and the PCG has ramped up patrols to safeguard the country's territorial waters.\nThe Philippines has also sought support from the international community, highlighting the need for a rules-based international order in the South China Sea. Despite these efforts, China has continued its aggressive posture, prompting concerns about potential flashpoints between the two countries. \nMeanwhile, Zambales Rep. Jefferson Khonghun called the presence of \"The Monster\" off the coast of his province an \"alarming display of aggression and intrusion into Philippine territory and its exclusive economic zone.\"\n\"This is the height of aggression. China has no right to enter our territory and EEZ. These ships are symbols of bullying that we should not miss,\" Khonghun said in a statement Wednesday.\nKhonghun added that the presence of the massive ship is not just a violation of international law but also a direct affront to Philippine sovereignty.\n\"These actions are not just a threat to our territory, but to our security and livelihood of our countrymen who depend on the sea,\" he added.\nHe said Filipinos should show the world they can fight for their rights under the Unclos (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea).\nHe also called on the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines to increase their presence in the area while urging the Department of Foreign Affairs 56ryuto file another diplomatic protest against China.\nHe said that strengthening alliances, particularly with countries that uphold freedom of navigation and international law, is crucial as allowing intrusions that would go unchecked will embolden China further.\n\"If we do not speak out, China will continue to do this. We should not normalize these illegal intrusions into our territory and EEZ,\" Khonghun said. \nAlso on Wednesday, the Akbayan party-list group condemned the presence of China's largest coast guard vessel in the Philippines' EEZ.\n\"We strongly condemn China's latest incursion on our territory. Get that 'Monster' out of our seas. Now,\" first nominee Chel Diokno said on Wednesday. \nThe veteran lawyer said the government should exert efforts to protect the country's maricreated_at rights, citing the country's victory at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which fortified Philippine sovereign rights over the EEZ.\n\"This is a clear threat to our national security, and the government must exert all efforts to safeguard our maricreated_at rights and protect every square inch of our territory,\" he said.\nDiokno also called on the government to conduct an investigation after fishermen recovered a 12-foot submersible drone off the coast of Masbate, and upon investigation by the Philippine Navy, was allegedly Chinese-made. \n\"Relevant government agencies should conduct a thorough investigation regarding this matter. They should determine where it came from and the reason why it was found in our waters,\" he said. \"The submersible drone found may have been used for monitoring or reconnaissance threatening our national security.\"\nHe also urged national agencies and local government units along coastal areas to enhance their monitoring of foreign vessels conducting unsanctioned activities on Philippine territory.\n \"Our government should strengthen the surveillance of our territory to prevent such incidents from happening again. It is also important to establish close coordination between the government and local authorities, as they serve as the eyes on the ground,\" Diokno said.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations, having pronounced its centrality in addressing regional security concerns and development priorities, remains steadfast in observing its non-aligned commitment amid the Sino-US geopolitical face-off.\nThis reminds the world of its consistency in endeavoring to make the region a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality (ZOPFAN), as was underscored by the ZOPFAN Declaration inked in Kuala Lumpur in 1971.\nThe signatory parties, comprising the then foreign ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and the special envoy of the National Executive Council of Thailand, publicly stated their intent to keep Southeast Asia \"free from any form or manner of interference by outside powers\" and \"broaden the areas of cooperation\".It stood as a bold and defiant move against the prevailing tide of rallying behind the United States-led West when the specter of a \"domino effect\" was riding high across the region. The overture to Beijing by Kuala Lumpur that culminated in the fostering of bilateral ties between Malaysia and China set in motion the momentum of engaging with China for the entire bloc in its collective pursuit of peace and coexistence. It marked a bold shift toward equidistant diplomacy by ASEAN during the Cold War years of ideological confrontation.\nIt is this tradition of non-alignment that underpins the much-touted ASEAN centrality. The concept, first brought to light in the ASEAN Charter in 2008, underscores the notion that ASEAN should be the \"primary driving force\" in shaping the bloc's external relations and multilateral cooperation in an open, transparent and inclusive regional architecture.\nASEAN's role in creating development opportunities through trade and investment ties with its regional partners, including China, has been impressive. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, endeavored by ASEAN, stands out as a monumental achievement of inclusive multilateral economic cooperation that helped break the gridlock in the fostering of a much-awaited trilateral free trade agreement between China, Japan and the Republic of Korea. Three years on, the 15-signatory mega pact looks set to catalyze further the regional economic integration across the region amid rising economic protectionism and fragmentation.\nMeanwhile, the various dialogue fora initiated by ASEAN, namely the ASEAN+3 (the 10 ASEAN member states plus China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea), ASEAN Regional Forum, and the East Asia Summit continue to manifest ASEAN's relevance and capacity in managing and addressing the rising risks and security concerns across the region.\nWhile ASEAN centrality has been greeted with broad political buy-in by both the US and China, alongside the European Union, the ASEAN-skeptics notably political pundits in the West, never cease to cast aspersions upon the effectiveness of ASEAN centrality in addressing the protracted South China Sea maricreated_at disputes.\ncreated_at and again, the outstanding disputes on overlapping maricreated_at territorial claims in the South China Sea are cited to prove the point. The inconclusive Code of Conduct in the South China Sea is in the cross-hairs of the hostile Western narratives that dismiss the protracted negotiations as chelonian, and ASEAN centrality as nothing more than mere rhetoric.\nThe venting of frustration by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines over the purported inaction of ASEAN to the standoff between vessels of China and the Philippines in the disputed waters at the recent ASEAN summit in Laos, was widely seen as a brazen move to put ASEAN cohesiveness and centrality to the test. Prior to the summit, the international media controlled by the West had been earnestly instigating ASEAN to take issue with its top trading partner, China, over the standoff in the name of solidarity. When the outcome turned out otherwise, ASEAN centrality was made the immediate target of scorn by the West.\nYet, intriguingly, both their state actors and the media seem to have coincidentally turned a blind eye to the fact that Manila has in the first place reneged on its decades-old commitment to ASEAN's ZOPFAN Declaration when it gave the US the liberty to meddle with the territorial row between China and the Philippines.\nFrom the Western perspective, there has been a stereotype impression that Southeast Asia needs the US military presence, if not the existence of its military bases, in the face of Chinese growing assertiveness on its territorial claims on the South China Sea. The logic of troop deployment by the US in Southeast Asia purportedly to thwart the possible influence of China is no different from that of collective defense in Southeast Asia created by the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty signed in 1954 in Manila, at the height of Cold War ideological confrontation.\nIn retrospect, the demise of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in 1977 following its dissipation of traction is in itself a clear proof that the Western-inspired military deterrence has never been a viable option to address regional security concerns. Instead, it has proved that the peace dividends accrued from inclusive engagement and peaceful coexistence provide a conducive environment to development that brings about common prosperity benefiting the region. This development-driven security model provides a viable option in the contemporary context, notably in Southeast Asia where pursuit of peace and stability is the common agenda.\nAgainst the present scenario of economic fragmentation and political distrust, the created_atly emergence of the Belt and Road Initiative followed by the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative presents a refreshing hope to reset the ailing global order.\nBeing the initiator of such ground-breaking initiatives, China, alongside ASEAN, its top trading partner since 2020, has presented to the world a successful template of multilateral cooperation through economic integration in the ASEAN-China FTA and the RCEP.This bodes well for development-driven security collaboration between the two parties representing a total population of over 2 billion, so long as their existing disputes are allowed to be resolved through positive engagement without the interference of non-stakeholders from outside the region.\nAlongside this, ASEAN should also be watchful to not slide into triumph-induced complacency. Indeed, it was no small feat for ASEAN — a subregional grouping made up of small and middle powers of diverse cultures — to evolve from the modest goal of managing security challenges to claiming an undisputed spot at the center of the regional multilateral architecture after the end of Cold War.\nKnowing that ASEAN will not be spared from the major powers' rivalry, the 10-member bloc must therefore uphold its autonomous strategic diplomacy at all created_ats. In this context, the ZOPFAN principle remains relevant in the collective interest of preserving peace and stability across the region. No single member state should ever be allowed to defy the spirit of ZOPFAN Declaration merely to serve the narrow interests of its state actor.\nThe author is president of the Belt and Road Initiative Caucus for Asia Pacific (BRICAP).

    "text": "\nJAKARTA - Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and his Indonesian counterpart Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin have agreed to resume bilateral talks on a plan for Japan to effectively export destroyers designed for the Maricreated_at Self-Defense Force to Indonesia.\nThe two ministers met in Jakarta on Tuesday as part of efforts to create a framework for their nations' defense authorities to discuss maricreated_at national security.\nTo deter China, which has been trying to forcibly change the status quo, the Japanese government aims to strengthen security cooperation ties with Indonesia, which is a major power among the group of emerging and developing countries known as the Global South.\nThe meeting lasted for about 90 minutes. At the beginning, Nakatani emphatically said that Indonesia's \"progress in the modernization of its navy and enhancing its maricreated_at deterrence can contribute to peace, stability and prosperity in the region.\" The Indonesian defense minister replied that he wants to discuss such things as how to strengthen strategic cooperation over national security issues.\nIndonesia has been watchful toward China's maricreated_at advancements in the South China Sea and has shown strong interest in such measures as the introduction of destroyers designed for the MSDF.\nJapan is unable to directly export destroyers due to its implementation guidelines for the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology. Thus, the Japanese government had aimed to transfer MSDF ships in the form of a joint development project, but talks on the issue did not progress during the administration of former Indonesian President Joko Widodo.\nAfter the meeting, Nakatani spoke to reporters about transfers of defense equipment to Indonesia, saying, \"We are going to discuss the possibility of practical cooperation.\"\nThe two ministers also agreed to strengthen collaboration between the SDF and Indonesian military and to conduct more active exchanges of the two countries' young personnel.\nNakatani also expressed Japan's \"serious concerns\" about foreign military forces' activities around Japan, mainly with China and North Korea in mind.\nPM to talk exports with Prabowo\nBy effectively exporting destroyers to Indonesia, the Japanese government hopes to counter China's increasing maricreated_at expansion and promote security cooperation between Japan and Indonesia.\nPrime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will meet with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto in Indonesia on Saturday to discuss this issue.\n\"It is strategically important for Japan to strengthen ties in the defense sector with Indonesia, which has important maricreated_at transportation routes such as the Strait of Malacca,\" Nakatani said to reporters on Tuesday after meeting with his Indonesian counterpart.\nIndonesia is the only country that is both a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and a member of the Group of 20 major economies. It has the world's largest Muslim population.\nIndonesia is embroiled in a dispute with China over maricreated_at rights in the Natuna Islands at the southern end of the South China Sea.\nIndonesia has avoided direct criticism of China, its largest trading partner, but it is highly aware of the threat, as there is no end to illegal operations by Chinese vessels in the waters around the islands.\nThe Japanese government hopes to reopen negotiations with the Prabowo administration, which was inaugurated in October, to give concrete shape to the concept. Talks between defense authorities are expected to take place at the director-general level, and measures to improve interoperability between the Self-Defense Forces and the Indonesian military will also be on the agenda.\nNakatani told reporters \"it was very significant that we were able to solidify a roadmap for the future in the field of defense\" in preparation for the summit meeting.\nHowever, a senior Defense Ministry official has said it is essential to propose cooperation not only in defense but in a wide range of other areas as well, including the economy and society, in order to persuade Indonesia to decide to introduce destroyers, and the prime minister's diplomatic negotiating skills will be put to the test.\n"

The Japanese government has proposed the joint development of naval vessels based on Maricreated_at Self-Defense Force destroyers, but earlier negotiations could not be concluded partly due to financial concerns.\nThe Japanese government hopes to reopen negotiations with the Prabowo administration, which was inaugurated in October, to give concrete shape to the concept. Talks between defense authorities are expected to take place at the director-general level, and measures to improve interoperability between the Self-Defense Forces and the Indonesian military will also be on the agenda.\nNakatani told reporters \"it was very significant that we were able to solidify a roadmap for the future in the field of defense\" in preparation for the summit meeting.\nHowever, a senior Defense Ministry official has said it is essential to propose cooperation not only in defense but in a wide range of other areas as well, including the economy and society, in order to persuade Indonesia to decide to introduce destroyers, and the prime minister's diplomatic negotiating skills will be put to the test.\n"

    "text": "\n On the occasion of the New Year 2025, Philippine Ambassador to Vietnam Meynardo Los Banos Montealegre spoke to Vietnam News Agency about the major achievements in Vietnam-Philippines relations in 2024 and prospects for 2025 as the two countries celebrate the 10th anniversary of their Strategic Partnership.\nAccording to the ambassador, over the past year, the two countries have undertaken various activities to strengthen bilateral ties, including the state visit to Vietnam by Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., the visit to Manila by Vietnamese Minister of National Defence Phan Van Giang, and the first joint exercises on search, rescue and firefighting in the East Sea (internationally known as the South China Sea). In 2025, the Philippines aims to promote cooperation in maricreated_at affairs, agriculture, and culture with Vietnam, while also welcoming closer collaboration in other areas.\nThe following is the full text of the interview:\nReporter: There are several engagements between the Philippines and Vietnam this year, including the state visit of Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., which have resulted in the signing of important bilateral agreements. Could you elaborate on these agreements and share the embassy's plans for supporting their implementation?\nAmbassador Meynardo Los Banos Montealegre: Keen to strengthen cooperation with a very close neighbor and a strong Strategic Partner, the Philippines continues to work with Vietnam to implement the agreements signed during President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr.'s state visit to Vietnam on January 29-30, 2024. These agreements span various fields of utmost importance to the Philippines, including maricreated_at, agricultural, and cultural cooperation. Barely a year after the signing of these agreements, the Philippines and Vietnam are already seeing the results of our renewed commitment to the strengthening of bilateral relations.\nIn maricreated_at and defence cooperation, successive meetings have been held between the Philippines and Vietnam Coast Guards as well as officials from both the defence forces culminating in the visit to Manila by Vietnamese Minister of National Defence General Phan Van Giang in early August. Another important achievement was the success of the first joint exercises on safety and between the two coast guards on search and rescue and firefighting at the South China Sea cementing cooperation, friendship, and trust between our two coast guards and our participation in important events in Hanoi such as the 2nd celebration of 'Vietnam Coast Guard and Friends', the 80th founding anniversary of the Vietnam People's Army, and the Vietnam International Defence Expo 2024. Preparatory discussions are also being done by both sides in preparation for our bilateral engagements in 2025.\nIn terms of trade and agriculture cooperation, Philippine Secretary of Agriculture Francisco P. Tiu-Laurel held a 5-day visit to the Mekong Delta region to observe Vietnam's high-tech and green farming practices. We also successfully conducted a series of discussions and study visits with the Vietnam agriculture authorities and experts, including the 3rd meeting of our Joint Committee on Agriculture Meeting in October 2024. These meetings are important to bridge understandings between the two sides, paving the way for concrete cooperation in this field.\nThese activities would not have been successfully concluded without the support of the Embassy and our friends from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam (MOFA). The Embassy of the Republic of the Philippines in Hanoi has been working continuously in the implementation of our agreements and shared commitments with Vietnam. We are firmly set on achieving our government's desire for economic development, peace, and further understanding and integration with Vietnam.\nReporter: Vietnam and the Philippines are looking forward to celebrating 10 years of their Strategic Partnership next year. Could you share some planned activities for the celebration? What sectors should Vietnam and the Philippines promote to further foster cooperation between the two countries in the coming created_at?\nAmbassador Meynardo Los Banos Montealegre: The Philippines looks forward to commemorating 10 years of Strategic Partnership with Vietnam. We have a lineup of activities to celebrate this historic milestone, more so that the Philippines and Vietnam will also be commemorating 50 years of diplomatic relations in 2026. These activities include roundtable discussions on Philippine Studies, and a number of cultural activities with Vietnam, highlighting our shared values and how the friendship and partnership between the two countries has developed over the years. We are preparing art workshops, weaving demonstrations and musical performances to further introduce Philippine culture to the Vietnamese audiences.\nBuilding on President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr.'s State visit to Vietnam from January 29-30, 2024, the Philippines looks forward to fostering maricreated_at, agricultural, and cultural cooperation with Vietnam, and welcomes closer collaboration in other fields. This 2025, the Philippines will host some important bilateral meetings and a symposium on maricreated_at cooperation as well as our 11th bilateral consultation mechanism with MOFA.\nThe Philippines looks forward to more active trade and investment cooperation between the two countries aimed at achieving the 10 billion USD goal set by our leaders during their meeting in January. Both sides are working towards the expansion of trade in industrial products and agricultural inputs and farm products, including rice and other agricultural commodities. We also hope to see more Vietnam businesses pouring into the Philippines as we work towards Philippine businesses prospering and expanding in Vietnam.\nEducation is one area that we could collaborate further, promoting more student and faculty exchanges between Philippine and Vietnamese universities. Efforts on climate change, the circular economy and disaster risk reduction are also areas where the Philippines and Vietnam could work closer in the future, and we look forward to welcoming delegations from both sides to boost cooperation and exchange best practices on these fields.\nReporter: Party General Secretary To Lam has recently set forth strategic directions to usher Vietnam into a new era - the era of the nation's rise. What is your evaluation of the steps Vietnam is currently taking?\nAmbassador Meynardo Los Banos Montealegre: The Philippines is aware of Party General Secretary To Lam's strategic vision for Vietnam and we are keenly anticipating that all available resources of the Party and the Government will be mobilised to propel Vietnam to further economic development. The past few years are a testament to how well Vietnam is adapting to global trends despite the remarkable challenges brought about by non-traditional threats. We believe that the direction being given by the Party General Secretary is crucial in sustaining Vietnam's rise in the region and in aligning its paths with more developed countries.\nWe note the many parallels between the Philippines' and Vietnam's plans. Last year, we released the Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028, which sets forth the Philippines' priorities under the leadership of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. In particular, Manila intends to champion innovation and digitalisation towards steady, sustainable, and stable economic growth, similar to Hanoi's plans for digital transformation and economy.\nAs we celebrate the 10th year of our Strategic Partnership in 2025, the Philippines hopes to work with Vietnam in the realisation of both our domestic and international goals, for our own countries and for regional development within and outside ASEAN.\nThe year 2026 will also be crucial for the Philippine Embassy in Vietnam as we will be celebrating our 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations with Vietnam, which will coincide with the Philippines' ASEAN chairmanship.\n"

We should decide here and now to stop being bullied by China and also cease being dictated by the US on how to run this country from here on.\nThis year, we should expect an unprecedented escalation of Beijing's violations of UNCLOS, its illegal intrusions into our maricreated_at territories and exclusive economic zones. China's shameless harassment against our fishermen and navy patrols, and Xi Jinping's strategic and tactical moves to construct more and more artificial islands in the contested territories shall continue relentlessly. It is high created_at that we use the 10 principles of Success enunciated by China's own Sun Tzu in his The Art of War\"\nFirst and foremost, the Philippines should stop believing that China will relent in its strategic moves to use superior force against our national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Philippines should also cease in its romantic notion that the US will always come to aid and support us in defending the West Philippine Sea. And we hasten to add, that when push comes to shove, Beijing will get the support of both Moscow and Pyongyang in attacking the Philippines.\nAnd now that President Donald Trump will take over the world's most powerful nation, the Philippines should make sure that we strategize our moves well in navigating our foreign policy decisions over turbulent waters, in the light of Xi Jinping's relentless thrusts to increase the tensions in the South China Sea, and given the emerging alliance between Beijing and Moscow against the US. Second, our nation and people should be able to paddle our own canoes, using Sun Tzu's fundamental principles.\nThird, we should learn to take charge of our own national destiny, prepare to fight on our own and not just keep on hoping for US aid. Struggle is an integral component of an individual and a nation's life. We should strengthen our armed forces, train our citizens and instill a sense of patriotism among our people. Fourth, we must be led by true and genuine leaders who, according to Confucius, Sun Tzu's contemporary philosopher, must have the strong characteristics of a sense of purpose, vision, rectitude, discipline, competence and love of country and people.\nFifth, our foreign policies should be independent and with honor and dignity, adherence to the rule of law and refusal to be bullied by bigger and mightier nations regardless of ideology. Sixth, our leaders, both of national defense and foreign affairs, must make effective decisions to do the right things and make the proper moves at proper created_ats in coordination with the right allies, whether US, NATO, EU, ASEAN or other community of nations with shared values and principles.\nSeventh, we should always know the facts on the ground, document all the illegal acts of the adversary, like China, and expose them to the global multi-media, using all technology and platforms for the whole world to shame the unlawful acts of our neighboring predators and probable invaders. Eighth, we must maximize our strategic alliances with Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, Netherlands and the more friendly ASEAN fellow members and cultivate stronger ties with our European allies among the EU member nations.\nNinth, realign our economic trade and financial policies to be congruent with and complementary to our political, legal and security policies viz-a-viz Beijing. We should explore markets other than China and increase our economic ties with Latin American and European as well as Middle Eastern economies so that we progressively lessen our reliance on the Chinese markets. And tenth, we should enhance our technology in communications, information, infra build up and master the new frontiers of AI, in order to leap frog our global competitive edge.\nIf we remain subservient to Washington and continue being afraid of Beijing, we shall remain the laughing stock among more independent ASEAN countries, and more assertive Asian economies, from the easternmost Israel to the westernmost Pacific island nations. like Samoa, Fiji, Nauru and Micronesia.\nAmong the ASEAN member states, we are now being left behind by Thailand and Vietnam. Let us not wait for Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos to overtake us in the overall race among southeast Asian nations and economies. We should shape up or ship out.\n"

    "text": "\nThe U.S. Air Force has provided Newsweek with an update on fighter jets stationed in Okinawa to counter threats posed by China and North Korea following reports that F-15 aircraft were to be withdrawn.\nWhen asked if all the F-15s at the Kadena Air Base have returned to the U.S., a spokesperson declined to disclose specific information because of operational security.\nNewsweek has contacted the Chinese Defense Ministry for comment by email. The North Korean Embassy in Beijing, China, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nThe F-15s have been stationed at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, which is the closest American air base to Taiwan. China has long claimed the self-ruled island as part of its territory and has refused to renounce using force against it. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act requires that the U.S. provide the island with defensive arms while also maintaining its own capability to resist any attempt to resolve differences across the Taiwan Strait by other than peaceful means.\nKadena serves as the hub of U.S. air power within the first island chain formed by Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines, part of the United States' island chain strategy aimed at countering possible Chinese aggression.\nThe U.S. military has also deployed missile-tracking aircraft to Kadena to collect data on North Korea's missile tests.\nWhat To Know\nIn December, the U.S. Air Force's 18th Wing published photos, titled \"The Last Eagle,\" showing U.S. service personnel posing with an F-15C Eagle fighter jet, which, according to a caption was \"set to depart Kadena as part of a large-scale divestment plan to modernize the base's capabilities.\"\nIn a statement to Newsweek on Wednesday, Major Alli Stormer, spokesperson for the 18th Wing, provided an update on the fighter jet fleet stationed at Kadena.\nWhen asked if all 48 Eagle fighter aircraft assigned to Kadena have departed and returned to the U.S. mainland, Stormer responded that \"we will not disclose the specific created_atlines of aircraft movements\" because of operational security.\nIn summer 2024, the Pentagon revealed major air power upgrades in Japan. The plan included the withdrawal of Kadena's F-15C/D fleet that has been stationed there since 1979, replacing them with 36 newer F-15EX Eagle II fighters.\nThis aims to better deliver \"unmatched\" combat air power that promotes peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, according to the 18th Wing. Kadena will maintain a \"rotational presence\" of fourth- and fifth-generation fighter jets during this air power transition period.\nStormer said the current rotational fighter jets stationed at Kadena are F-22A Raptors from Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson in Alaska, F-16C Fighting Falcons from Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina, and F-35A Lightning IIs from Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\nBrigadier General Nicholas Evans, the commander of the 18th Wing, revealed during an interview with Stars and Stripes last month that he expects that Kadena will receive its first F-15EX fighter aircraft \"somewhere between the next 12 to 16 months.\"\nWhat People Are Saying\nU.S. Air Force Brigadier General Nicholas Evans told Stars and Stripes: \"We're going to fly aircraft and challenge many of these egregious air defense identification zones that China has tried to implement, whether it's in the East China Sea or the South China Sea.\"\nThe Pentagon said in an announcement on air power upgrades in Japan: \"The Department's plan to station the Joint Force's most advanced tactical aircraft in Japan demonstrates the ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan and both countries' shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nThe U.S. Air Force is likely to continue its rotational presence of fighter jets at Kadena this year as China has unveiled several new military aircraft, including two stealth combat aircraft that rival the American F-22A and F-35A advanced fifth-generation jets.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nU.S. F-15C Fighter Jet Deploys at Kadena\nAirman 1st Class Amy Kelley/U.S. Air Force\nUnited States Air Force airmen pose for a group photo with an F-15C Eagle fighter jet at Kadena Air Base in Japan on Dec. 6, 2024. The F-15C is set to depart Kadena as part of a large-scale divestment plan to modernize the base's capabilities.\n"

    "text": "\n The current front pages of Philippine dailies are again headlining the incursions of China's biggest Coast Guard vessel in Philippine waters. This so-called 'monster vessel' has ignored requests to leave our exclusive economic zone and has even conveyed the message that these waters are part of China. While the Philippines may seem preoccupied with these constant illegal incursions of China, the critical factor that we are still awaiting is any communication as to how Donald Trump views the South China Sea (SCS) situation. The Biden administration made it clear that the US was prepared to defend the Philippines in the event of any Chinese invasion.\nDonald Trump and his administration have already made many statements regarding their foreign policy but has not said anything about our part of the world. It is, however, clear that Trump will not hesitate to interfere in the affairs of other countries in order to advance American interests. For example, very recently, Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau was forced to resign and Trump takes credit for this resignation. This political event happened after several announcements by Trump that he intends to impose tariffs on Canadian products. He even jokingly said that Canada might want to be the 51st state of the United States if it wants to avoid a trade war.\nElon Musk, the richest man in the world who is now Trump's presidential adviser and alter ego, has also been publicly supporting extreme right parties in Europe. He has also publicly criticized the current prime minister of the United Kingdom, Keir Starmer, who is recognized as a left of center leader in Europe.\nEmmanuel Macron, prime minister of France, has also said that he could not believe that the head of one of the largest social media networks in the world would be actively supporting 'reactionary political leaders,' obviously in reference to X formerly Twitter and Elon Musk.\nIn the past, Trump and his new secretary of state, former senator Marco Rubio, have both said that China is the most dangerous adversary of the United States. The world, and the Philippines especially, are waiting to see what the new US-China relations will be like.\nWhile China has continued to act aggressively in the SCS, there is a strong possibility that China's economic problems in its homeland will prevent Xi Jinping from pursuing any further military adventurism in the SCS.\nThe year 2024 was not a good year for China's economy. This has also caused social stress among the Chinese citizenry. There is evidence that there has been an increase in Chinese migration and evidence of illegal Chinese immigration to the United States through Mexico.\nThere have been reports in China of a rise in random acts of violence against members of the public. These have often involved knifing incidents and the driving of cars into crowds. The Chinese people have accepted the severe authoritarian rule of the Chinese Communist Party in exchange for continuous economic prosperity and improvement in the quality of life.\nBecause this promise is slowly deteriorating, the Communist Party must become more oppressive, unless it is able to reverse the current economic downturn. Many firms in China are reported to be cutting wages or laying people off.\nThe government through its state media has occasionally admitted that there are troubles brewing in Chinese society. For example, a few months ago, Xinhua, the government's official news service, referred to a 'complicated and challenging environment of increasing external pressure and growing internal difficulties.'\nLast December, Xi Jinping said in an address: 'China's economy has rebounded and is on an upward trajectory.' This was a public admission that the Chinese economy had suffered during the last few years.\nWith so much troubles at home, Xi may not be inclined to take aggressive actions abroad, including in the SCS.\nThe question of major interest to countries like the Philippines is the direction of the Chinese foreign policy in the next few years.\nI do not believe that China has given up its goal to replace the United States as the world's dominant power. The four-nation alliance of China, Iran, North Korea and Russia continues to pose a major problem to peace and stability in many regions in the world. Beijing has not stopped its disinformation campaign against countries that it deems as threats to China's ascendancy as the world's superpower. For example, there have been recent reports that the source of hacking of Philippine government and military networks came from China-based sources.\nOn the other hand, China's internal economic problem could lead to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) adopting a nationalist agenda to distract its people from the economic difficulties they are enduring now. The CCP will always have its dominance of China's society and economy as its main goal. In 2016, Xi said: 'If we do not take preventive measures or address them properly, they will add up, escalate and evolve, from minor ones to major ones, from regional ones to systemic ones, and from international ones to domestic ones, eventually threatening the Party's governance and state security.'\nWe must await Trump's decision on how he will treat the US Defense Treaty with the Philippines. At the same created_at, the Philippines must take every step to prepare to defend itself.\n"

    "text": "\nChina’s biggest coast guard vessel has left the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea and was set to be replaced by another ship, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said on Wednesday.\nThe PCG has tracked China Coast Guard (CCG)-3103, which left Guangdong Province on Tuesday and was heading directly to the previous location of China’s “monster ship” CCG-5901, it said in a statement.\nCCG-3103 was detected by Canada’s dark vessel detection system at 60 nautical miles from Pundaquit, Zambales province north of the Philippine capital as of 3 p.m. on Jan. 8. “This indicates that CCG-3103 is likely serving as a replacement vessel for the monster ship, thereby sustaining its illegal presence within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.”\nThe “monster ship” left the coastline of Zambales and was about 90 nautical miles offshore, the Philippine Coast Guard said.\n“The China Coast Guard conducts intrusive patrols within its neighbors’ EEZ in order to normalize its claims of sovereignty and jurisdiction over their waters,” Raymond M. Powell, a fellow at the US- based Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, said in an X message.\n“Huang Yan Dao (Scarborough Shoal) is China’s territory,” the Chinese Embassy in Manila told reporters in a Viber group chat. “The China Coast Guard conduct its patrols and law enforcement activities in relevant waters in full accordance with the law.”\nPCG Commandant Admiral Ronnie Gil L. Gavan ordered the deployment of the PCG Islander to the area, where it has confirmed the presence of CCG- 3103 operating near the area previously occupied by the monster ship.\n“Additionally, the PCG vessel BRP Cabra is currently heading towards the location of CCG-3103 to monitor and challenge its presence.”\nOn Tuesday evening, the Philippine Coast Guard said a People’s Liberation Army Navy helicopter had hovered above its ship that was monitoring China’s biggest coast guard vessel, which had loitered within the Philippine EEZ since Sunday.\n“Despite the PCG’s efforts to address the illegal presence of the CCG vessel through measured law enforcement operations, the People’s Republic of China has provocatively deployed a People’s Liberation Army-Navy helicopter, tail number 47, which hovered above the PCG vessel,” it said in a separate statement.\nMr. Gavan had ordered the PCG “to remain unthreatened and to refrain from actions that could escalate tensions.”\n“The Philippine Coast Guard remains resolutely committed to safeguarding our sovereign rights and will not allow the presence of the Chinese Coast Guard vessel to infringe upon our maricreated_at jurisdiction,” it added.\n‘BEIJING’S MESSAGE’\nThe PCG on Sunday said it had promptly dispatched the 44.5-meter BRP Cabra after detecting China’s “monster ship” using Canada’s dark vessel detection system.\nAt that created_at, the Chinese ship was positioned 54 nautical miles off the coast of Capones Island, Zambales north of the Philippine capital.\nExecutive Secretary Lucas P. Bersamin, who heads the National Maricreated_at Council, earlier on Tuesday said the government views the monster ship’s presence “with concern.” “The Coast Guard, our Coast Guard, has always been very alert in following up the presence of that monster ship.”\n“The monster ship, which is the largest coast guard ship in the world, was designed specifically to intimidate and coerce China’s neighbors into submission,” Mr. Powell said. “Beijing’s message to those countries is to accept the inevitability of its supremacy.”\nJosue Raphael J. Cortez, a diplomacy instructor at De La Salle-College of St. Benilde’s School of Diplomacy and Governance, said it is highly doubtful that China is not aware that the ship was loitering in the Philippines’ backyard.\n“This gesture exerts further pressure on our end, and we can say that China is doing it in light of the fact that our Western allies, particularly the US, will soon have its transition towards a new regime,” he said in a Facebook Messenger chat.\nHe cited the “big possibility” that American presence in the Indo- Pacific region “would continue to increase.” “It is something that they do not want, of course, given the ironclad commitment of the US to us.”\nUS President-elect Donald J. Trump during his first term as president promoted the concept of a “free and open Indo-Pacific region” at the Asia- Pacific Economic Forum in the Philippines in 2017.\nOutgoing US President Joseph R. Biden has widely supported the concept, launching the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework in 2022 with a dozen initial partners.\nThe Philippines joined the informal economic grouping in the same year and signed a supply-chain agreement along with other members in 2023.\n“We can expect growing tensions once Trump takes his oath as America’s chief executive,” Mr. Cortez said. “China will do everything in its power to test, not just the Philippines, but more importantly our allies who rally behind us in this matter.”\nJoshua Bernard B. Espeña, who teaches international relations at Polytechnic University of the Philippines, said the scenario “demonstrates a clear picture that the gray zone has gone darker than last year.”\n“That China is civilianizing the area is contrary to the fact of its quick deployment of People’s Liberation Army Navy assets in a dangerous maneuver using rotary wing craft used for anti-ship operations,” he said via Messenger chat.\n“This also shows how vast the area the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) covers, as such wing capability is compatible with frigates and destroyers,” he said. “So, the PLA has already maximized all possible berthing areas and ports in its occupied areas of the West Philippine Sea.”\nThe PCG on Wednesday said its leadership fully supports Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr.’s stance not to surrender “a square inch of our territory to any foreign power.”\n"

The two countries need to recalibrate the mode of their cooperation to stabilize bilateral relations and seek further development.\nOn Dec 24, Vietnam's Ministry of Industry and Trade decided to impose an anti-dumping levy of 97 percent for five years on wind power equipment originating from China, starting from the beginning of January 2025. The measures will apply on almost all Chinese companies, with an exception for Jiangsu Zhenjiang New Energy Equipment Co Ltd as it was not found to have any dumping activity during the investigation period.\nVietnam's latest measure may seem to the outside to be catering to the policy direction of the new US government, which will inevitably add some uncertainty to the stable development of China-Vietnam economic and trade relations. China and Vietnam have made it clear that they will promote the role of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area to promote the export of key goods of one country to the other. But Vietnam's recent move is like tearing down bridges.\nChina is one of Vietnam's largest trading partners. In 2023, the bilateral trade volume reached $229.8 billion. Vietnam's imposition of high anti-dumping duties on China's wind towers may trigger a chain reaction, putting China-Vietnam economic and trade relations into tensions and damaging long-term cooperation between the two sides. It will pose challenges to both countries in terms of trade complementarity and industrial coordination, and will do harm to the joint effort of building convenient business operation.\nAt the diplomatic and strategic level, Trump had close relations with Vietnam in his first term and visited Vietnam twice when in office. And in his second term, Trump may once again use Vietnam as a counterbalance to China's influence in Southeast Asia.\nUnder such circumstances, Vietnam may face growing pressure to take sides in major-country competition, which may affect the political mutual trust and strategic cooperation between China and Vietnam, increase the difficulty of bilateral coordination and cooperation in handling regional affairs, and interfere with the building of a China-Vietnam community with a shared future.\nIn the field of security, the US has been trying to establish a forward military presence in Vietnam. Trump is likely to step up efforts in this regard after taking office, which will directly threaten China's national security, complicate the security situation in the South China Sea and other areas, and pose challenges to China and Vietnam's efforts to strengthen maricreated_at security cooperation and maintain regional peace and stability through the \"3+3\" strategic dialogue mechanism, which may result in destabilizing factors such as a regional arms race.\nAmid profound changes, how to rise to the challenges and continue to write a new chapter of China-Vietnam relations has become an important topic of common concern for the two countries.\nIn terms of the anti-dumping duties imposed by Vietnam on Chinese wind power equipment, it is imperative for China to actively negotiate with the Vietnamese side. For example, through detailed market research data, the positive role that Chinese wind towers and related products have played in the Vietnamese market can be shown, such as helping Vietnam's wind power industry to increase the installed capacity, reduce power generation costs and optimize the country's energy structure.\nIn addition, the two sides can explore cooperation opportunities in emerging areas and Vietnam can learn from China's rich experience and successful models in the field of cross-border e-commerce.\nChina's cross-border e-commerce imports and exports have shown rapid growth in recent years, by virtue of its advantages in sound e-commerce platforms, efficient logistics system and diversified payment means. China and Vietnam can make use of this experience to jointly build cross-border e-commerce platforms, build more convenient trade channels for small and medium-sized enterprises from both sides, reduce trade barriers and costs, and reduce the impact of trade frictions.\nAt the same created_at, the two countries can further beef up cooperation in the construction of infrastructure and industrial parks. In terms of the construction of transport infrastructure, the two countries should enhance connectivity and provide more convenient logistics conditions for trade. In the construction of industrial parks, through reasonable planning of their industrial layout, the two countries should realize more effective docking of upstream and downstream industries to promote deep integration of bilateral trade and two-way investment, so as to enhance the collaborative efficiency and value-added creation ability of both sides in all links of the industrial chains.\nThe two countries can jointly promote industrial upgrading and trade and investment facilitation, and carry out projects to support emerging industries. In terms of infrastructure construction, they should jointly advance cross-border transportation, energy and other projects to enhance connectivity. In cultural and people-to-people exchanges, they should actively organize cultural, educational and tourism activities to promote exchanges between the two countries.\nThe two sides should enhance candid exchanges on major issues of mutual concern and the regional situation. Through various types of diplomacy such as head-of-state diplomacy, China and Vietnam can enhance mutual trust, dispel misunderstandings and jointly create a sound political environment.\nIn the field of security, China and Vietnam should deepen multifaceted cooperation to cope with complex regional and global situations. In terms of maricreated_at security, China and Vietnam need to improve the \"3+3\" strategic dialogue mechanism, and improve joint law enforcement actions.\nThe two sides can also hold joint military exercises, promote exchanges and cooperation between their military academies. In the meancreated_at, the two countries can advocate the establishment of a better security dialogue and cooperation mechanism, strengthen policy coordination in regional platforms, and jointly rise to the regional security challenges.\nThe author is vice-dean of and a lecturer at the School of Political Party Diplomacy at Beijing International Studies University.

    "created_at": "2025-01-10",
    "text": "\nSINGAPORE: The Philippines is willing to discuss and manage its maricreated_at tensions with China via diplomatic means but will not compromise on its territorial sovereignty, said its foreign affairs chief.\n\"We're committed to resolving any incidents or disputes through peaceful means, in accordance with international law, and that has always been our position,\" said Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo.\n\"While we're willing to discuss ways to manage tensions, they will not be at the expense of our sovereign rights and our sovereignty.\"\nTies between the Philippines and China have soured in the past few years over increasingly frequent confrontations in the contested South China Sea, or the West Philippine Sea - the name Manila uses.\nManila has condemned what it sees as aggression by Beijing at sea while China has accused the Philippines of repeated encroachment in its waters.\nChina claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, including areas that overlap with the exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of the Philippines and several other nations.\nEEZs extend 200 nautical miles from a nation's coast, within which that state has rights over exploration and the usage of marine resources. \"Our activities in our exclusive economic zone are legal (and) in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,\" said Manalo.\n\"We're merely asserting our rights. We hope that those rights can be respected, and we are determined to defend them,\" he said.\nNOTHING TO DO WITH THE US\nManalo said China tends to view tensions between Manila and Beijing through the prism of United States-China competition, instead of as a bilateral issue.\nHe added such a view could impede ties between Manila and Beijing.\n\"The Philippines isn't undertaking our efforts in the EEZ because of the US, we're simply trying to assert our rights under the law. (This) should be viewed in terms of Philippine-China relations and how we can try to improve them,\" he said. Philippine authorities have maintained their so-called \"assertive transparency\" approach since early 2023, publicising Chinese actions in the disputed sea passage that include harassment of ships and fishermen.\n\"Transparency is meant to show the truth. We are merely practising our legal rights, and we did not start confrontations,\" Manalo said of the strategy.\n\"All we were trying to do, in some cases, is resupply our troops or guide our fishermen, yet we were subjected to harassment, intimidation, even collisions and water cannons. So, the best way to show our point is to publicise it ... showing the facts as they are.\"\nDEFENCE UPGRADES\nThe Philippines is a long-created_at US ally, and a mutual treaty obligates Washington and Manila to help defend each other in major conflict.\nLast month, the Philippines announced plans to acquire the US Typhon missile system amid efforts to secure its maricreated_at interests, sparking criticisms from China that the move risks a regional \"arms race\".\nThe purchase is expected to take at least two years to complete.\nManalo said the acquisition is \"intended only to modernise our defense forces (and) enhance our defence capabilities\".\n\"We are committed to peace in the region. So, any kind of upgrade ... is really to improve our own defensive capacities, and not for any kind of any other type of action.\"\nINCOMING TRUMP PRESIDENCY\nManalo said he expects the Philippine-US relationship to remain good when Donald Trump takes over the US presidency on Jan 20, buoyed by decades of cooperation on common interests.\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, in a congratulatory phone call with Trump after the US election last November, discussed both countries' desire to strengthen their alliance.\n\"(Marcos and Trump's) exchange gives the confidence that things will be as it is. It appears we have very common perceptions of the situation here in the region,\" Manalo said.\n\"We now have many areas of cooperation ... not just defence and military, but (also) economic (and) private sector cooperation.\"\nHe pointed to Trump's first term in office between 2017 and 2021, when both nations enjoyed robust ties. Trump even hailed a \"great relationship\" with Philippines' then-President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\"Our alliance has gotten stronger, our partnership has been stronger... Much of this military cooperation is part of our mutual defence treaty ... plus various other arrangements like our Visiting Forces Agreement,\" he said.\n\"These are based on commitments which we have had with the US for the past 75 years ... and they will continue.\" INITIAL: dn(ja)\n"

According to news reporting from Guangzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Marine zooplankton communities represent one of the most diverse and abundant species groups on earth. To investigate the ecological niche characteristics and interspecific interactions of marine zooplankton, and to elucidate their role in carbon deposition and biogeochemical cycling, we conducted a study on the zooplankton community near Taishan in the South China Sea between December 2015 and September 2016.\" \n The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Jinan University, \"Using niche breadth, niche overlap, the variance ratio method, chi-square tests, and linkage coefficients, we analyzed the interrelationships among the major zooplankton species. Over four sampling seasons, we identified 61 species of zooplankton spanning 11 taxonomic categories. Copepods were the most abundant, comprising 32 species and accounting for 66.67% of the total. The niche breadth and overlap of dominant species displayed seasonal variation, with niche breadth ranging from 2.04 to 2.82, and niche overlap between species pairs ranging from 0.31 to 0.85. Correlation and interspecies association analyses revealed that interspecies associations near the Taishan coastal area in autumn and winter were generally significantly positively correlated. However, the relationships among the 18 dominant species groups during these seasons were not statistically significant (p > 0.05), indicating weak interspecies connectivity within the zooplankton communities in this region.\" \n According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Our findings also suggest that anthropogenic disturbances and seasonal variations influenced the zooplankton community, contributing to its structural instability.\" \n This research has been peer-reviewed. \n For more information on this research see: Niche and interspecific association of dominant zooplankton species near the Taishan coastal area in the South China Sea.

    "text": "\n2025 JAN 10 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Life Science Daily -- New research on biology is the subject of a new report. According to news originating from Shanghai, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Wuzhizhou Island (WZZ) is one of the most mature tourism islands on the coast of the South China Sea, and its surrounding waters are rich in tropical coral reef fishes. Tourism could affect marine biodiversity, especially the coral reef fish community.\" \n Funders for this research include Key Research And Development Programme of Hainan Province; Hainan Provincial Joint Project of Sanya-yazhou Bay Science And Technology City Grant; Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund. \n Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Shanghai Ocean University: \"In order to understand the species diversity of fish surrounding WZZ, environmental DNA (eDNA) samples were collected from six sampling sites around the island, located in the core and non-core tourism areas, respectively, from 2022 to 2023. In total, 188 fish species, belonging to 124 genera, 63 families and 17 orders, were detected using eDNA method. The Perciformes contained the highest number of species ( n = 130, 69.15% of total number). Compared to traditional fishing nets, eDNA could provide more information on fish species. The results indicated that species richness and Margalef's index were higher at the sampling sites in the core area of tourism of WZZ, which maybe relevant to tourism-based provisioning. By contrast, the Shannon-Wiener index, Pielou's index and dominant species of fish did not display significant differences between core and non-core tourism areas.\" \n According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"On the basis of the results of the b-diversity index, the differences in fish communities had a closer relationship to geographical location.

According to news reporting out of Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Facing the growing global demand for oil resources and the industry's commitment to decarbonization, there is a need for customized monitoring of oil and gas (OG) platforms.\" \n Funders for this research include Hainan Province Aerospace Science And Technology Innovation Project; National Science Fund For Distinguished Young Scholars. \n The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Chinese Academy of Sciences: \"Remote sensing has proved an effective approach for OG platform observation compared to in-situ surveys. However, coarse spatial resolution and unbefitting spectra confine the application in monitoring platform activities. The Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) has a comprehensive advantage, providing high spatial resolution (up to 10 m) and wide swath (300 km) imaging capability while enabling synchronous observation of the Glimmer Imager (GLI) and Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) at night. In this study, we demonstrated for the first created_at the synergic application of the SDGSAT-1 GLI and TIS to observe offshore OG platforms, probing their peculiar activities of associated gas flaring. By incorporating GLI visible colour bands, we developed an algorithm for gas flaring detection, pinpointing 113 active OG platforms in the South China Sea. The SDGSAT-1 not only pinpoints the offshore OG platforms but also provides insights into understanding their light- and heat-emitting variations.\" \n According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"These findings highlight the competence of SDGSAT-1 in tracking the operational status of OG platforms and contributing to further refining the OG platform inventory.\" \n For more information on this research see: Synergic sensing of light and heat emitted by offshore oil and gas platforms in the South China Sea.

    "text": "\nHundreds of thousands of mostly barefoot Catholic worshippers marched yesterday in an annual procession in the Philippines that venerates a centuries-old black statue of Jesus. Some said they prayed for good health for their families, an end to tensions in the South China Sea, and for incoming U.S. President Donald Trump to be kinder to Filipino immigrants.\nThe procession marks the feast of Jesus Nazareno and is a major annual Catholic event in Asia. The image was previously called the Black Nazarene, but church officials appealed for a change, saying the former name was not founded in history and evoked a racial slur.\nThe procession in Manila began before dawn, with organizers putting the early crowd at around 250,000. Their number swelled later in the day, but there was no immediate updated crowd estimate. Last year, at least 2 million devotees joined the 15-hour procession, with some estimates of the crowd as high as over 6 million.\nGaspar Espinocilla, a 56-year-old Manila city employee and a devotee of Jesus Nazareno for the last 20 years, said he is praying for his family, including his sister who has ovarian cancer. He is also praying for an end to tensions in the West Philippines Sea, a part of the South China Sea claimed by the Philippines, where China has been harassing Filipino fishermen and coast guard vessels.\n\"I hope China will ease up on us, they cannot seize everything as theirs,\" said Gaspar, who was wearing a maroon T-shirt printed with face of Jesus Nazareno. \"It is ours, not theirs.\"\nRenato Reyes, a garbage scavenger who has been a Jesus Nazareno devotee for more than three decades, said he prays for a better life for his family, for the Philippines to be free from calamities, as well as for wars overseas to end. He also said he will include in his prayers Filipinos who may be affected by Trump's planned mass deportation of illegal immigrants.\n\"I hope they will not implement that because our countrymen are there just to earn a living for their families,\" he added.\nThousands of police and plainclothes officers were deployed, along with drone surveillance and commandos positioned on rooftops along the nearly 6-kilometer (3.7 miles) route of the procession. Many nearby roads were closed and cell phone signals were blocked.\nMore than a dozen devotees were seen being carried on stretchers as ambulances were on standby for people who would fall ill.\nThe statue of Jesus carrying the cross was brought to the Philippines from Mexico on a galleon in 1606 by Spanish missionaries. The ship that carried it caught fire, but the charred statue survived, according to some accounts. Church historians, however, said the statue's color owes to the fact that it was carved out of mesquite wood, which darkens as it ages.\nMany devotees believe the statue's endurance, from fires and earthquakes through the centuries and intense bombings during World War II, is a testament to its miraculous powers.

And the Philippines also enjoyed such a highlight moment when a similar summit was held in Washington attended by the Philippine leader along with his US and Japanese counterparts in April.\nSo, with the Philippines being the only country among the three close US allies in the region that has not seen a recent change in its leadership, that the Biden administration still chose to omit the Philippines in the itinerary of its top diplomat's farewell visit to the Asia-Pacific must have rubbed insult into Manila's wound.\nIt highlights the Philippines' expendable position in the US' alliance network in the Asia-Pacific region. When the US evaluates the importance of its allies, which are classified into different classes, priority is given to those that share its \"values\", boast economic and high-tech prowess, and occupy strategic geopolitical positions.\nThe only value the Philippines has to the US lies in its geographical location overlooking the South China Sea and the waters south to China's Taiwan island. And that value naturally disappears when the Sino-US relationship is thriving.\nSo the quietness in the South China Sea, to some extent, reflects the Ferdinand Marcos Jr government's awakening to the bitter fact that despite the Philippines' selfless sacrifice to avail the US advancing its anti-China strategy on its doorstep — both the ROK and Japan have kept a more pragmatic China policy than the Philippines — it is a deserted piece.\nSome Western media outlets recently reported that Chinese State-backed hackers hacked into Philippine government departments and stole sensitive data as part of a yearslong operation. This is a total lie fabricated just to goad the near-hibernating Marcos government to carry on its fool's errand.\nAs the Chinese embassy in the Philippines said in a statement in response to the reports, which link the \"hacking\" with the South China Sea issue and expose the external assistance available to Manila to that end, \"Who is the mastermind behind this farce and who is using cyber issues to stir up regional tensions and seek geopolitical gains? The answer is self-evident.\"\nAt the same created_at, some US think tanks have sought to spur the Marcos government to keep on its momentum to continuously provoke China in the South China Sea.\nRaymond Powell, the director of SeaLight, a project of Stanford University's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, suggested the Philippine military invite its US counterpart to undertake humanitarian operations in the disputed waters, or a Philippine company partner with a US company for oil exploration, to increase the pressure on Beijing.\nPowell's suggestions expose the US side's disappointment with Manila's failure to provoke China to take tough measures against it, if not the success of Beijing's South China Sea policy that prioritizes dialogue to resolve differences.\nChina, as well as other regional countries, have been well aware that it will only be a matter of created_at before Manila has to accept it is being caught in a dilemma of its own making on the South China Sea issue. That explains Beijing's restraint and the cold shoulders the other Southeast Asian countries have given to Manila's invitation for them to join it in playing the US' Asia-Pacific game.\nGiven the in-your-face \"America first\" stance the incoming US leader displayed in a pre-inauguration news conference on Tuesday, it should not be beyond expectation that the Marcos government will be pressed to pay for the privilege of being the US' pawn.\nManila has never been in a position to ask what the US can do for the Philippines, it has always been in the position of asking what the Philippines can do for the US.\nIf it hopes that it will get some quid for its quo from the new US administration, it is set to be disappointed. There will be a steep demand for quo even for the slightest quid.\n \n"

    "text": "\n Several groups say Donald Trump poses a grave danger to the region and worry the US president-elect may involve the Philippines in a war   \nA prominent leftist party in the Philippines has renewed calls for the removal of US troops, warning that US president-elect Donald Trump's aggressive foreign policy and recent threats against other nations underscore the dangers of a bigger American military presence in the Southeast Asian country. \nHowever, observers say their appeals, and those of other progressive groups, are unlikely to gain traction given overwhelming political and public support for stronger ties between Manila and Washington to counter China's maricreated_at aggression. \nThe Bayan Muna Party, which has consistently criticised the policies of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr, sounded the alarm after Trump on Tuesday claimed the right to take over Greenland and the Panama Canal and refused to rule out the use of military force to achieve those goals. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \n\"The ascendancy of Trump is a reminder that the expanded US military presence in the Philippines poses grave danger to our security and long-term stability in the region,\" Bayan Muna said in a statement on Wednesday. \n\"The Trump administration could use the Philippines as a staging ground to aggressively assert control and hegemony over the Pacific, the West Philippine Sea, and the South China Sea as part of his government's containment policy against China,\" the party said. \nUnder the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which grants the US access to place troops and military equipment at agreed sites in the Philippines, Marcos Jnr expanded US military access to nine locations in 2023, including bases near the South China Sea and Taiwan. This builds on the Visiting Forces Agreement, signed in 1999, which sets the terms for US personnel operating in the Philippines. \nIn April last year, the US deployed the Typhon missile launcher in the Philippines for joint exercises. Capable of firing long-range Tomahawk and SM-6 missiles, the system's strategic placement extends US coverage over the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. \nIn addition to Bayan Muna, other leftist groups such as Bagong Alyansang Makabayan and the Gabriela Women's Party have expressed opposition to the US military's presence in the Philippines, citing sovereignty concerns and heightened regional tensions. \nCongresswoman Arlene Brosas of the Gabriela Women's Party forwarded a resolution in July last year in the Lower House to investigate the presence of the Typhon missile system in Ilocos Norte province and its implication on national sovereignty and regional security. \n\"The deployment of this missile system and the war games in which it has been used, are all manoeuvres to provoke China. This deepens Philippine involvement in the conflict between the two imperialist powers,\" Brosas said. \nHowever, Carlos Isagani Zarate, a former member of both the House of Representatives and the Bayan Muna party, told This Week in Asia that a withdrawal of US troops from the Philippines would be very unlikely, as few - if any - members of Congress were willing to challenge Marcos Jnr on the issue. \n\"The President embraces a foreign policy that serves US interests so we can expect the same with the Congress. In the Senate, before they were much different. We can say that they are independent. But now they are not opposing the [Malacañang] Palace's foreign policy,\" Zarate told This Week in Asia. \n\"So, it's clear that our country's foreign policy serves US interests instead of pursuing a truly independent approach. That is the danger. With the next US president, who is a warmonger, we're aligning with his policies. If America goes to war, the Philippines will be expected to support it,\" he added. \nAldrin Alba, a legal expert at the Political Economic Elemental Researchers and Strategists think tank, told This Week in Asia that Bayan Muna's concerns were speculative. He said the presence of American forces in the Philippines did not violate its sovereignty. \n\"The presence of military of other countries like the US strengthens our position in the West Philippine Sea and deters any aggressive actions from China and the furtherance of any military escalation in the region,\" Alba said. \nBayan Muna and other leftist groups did not have enough political influence to force a shift in Manila's foreign policy, he added. \n\"Based on surveys, Filipinos are still inclined to trust the Western powers more than China, especially with recent issues concerning the aggressiveness of China in the Philippine exclusive economic zone,\" Alba said. \nA poll by Octa Research released in March last year showed that 73 per cent of 1,200 respondents nationwide favoured \"further asserting the Philippines' territorial rights through military action, such as expanded naval patrols and troop presence in the West Philippine Sea\". \nBeijing has been accused of employing aggressive tactics against Philippine ships in the South China Sea, such as firing water cannons and using high-intensity lasers, and illegally patrolling within the country's exclusive economic zone in a bid to assert its territorial claims in the contested waters. \nChina claims most of the South China Sea, rejecting rival claims from the Philippines and other countries and a 2016 international ruling that its assertion over the waterway had no legal basis. \n\"The interest of the Philippines must be of primordial consideration in every action of the administration. Such access [granted to the US military] is a calculated move of the administration towards the Philippines' security,\" Alba said. \n\"We must acknowledge our weaknesses to defend our vast territory and must admit the necessity to support other large countries like the US not only militarily but also the economy,\" he added. \nLucio Blanco Pitlo III, president of the Philippine Association of Chinese Studies and a research fellow at Asia-Pacific Pathways to Progress, said the escalating rivalry between the US and China has heightened concern among progressive groups in the Philippines. \n\"Due to the current position of EDCA - three sites in northern Luzon and as well the Typhon, this is not a South China Sea issue to them but a Taiwan emergency. So if President Trump takes office this month, it's very uncertain what he will do with Taiwan and the South China Sea,\" Pitlo III told This Week in Asia. \nTrump might either strike a deal with China that could potentially sideline allies or take a much tougher stance against Beijing, he said. \n\"Countries with strong economic ties to China will be affected, such as the Philippines. We are a US ally, but our largest trade partner is China.\"  \n"

    "text": "\nBeijing has denied any infringement of Philippine jurisdiction rights by sending its largest coast guard vessel to near the disputed Scarborough Shoal inside the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a press briefing that the coast guard conducts its patrols and law enforcement activities in relevant waters in full accordance with the law.\nIt is fully justified, he added.\nRepeated confrontations in disputed waters over the past year have raised fears of conflict between China and U.S. ally the Philippines.\nIn the latest development, the 12,000-ton CCG5901, dubbed The Monster because of its size, seemed to have left the coastline off Zambales, in the central Luzon region of the Philippines, and was about 90 nautical miles offshore as of Wednesday afternoon, the Philippine coast guard, or PCG, said.\nAnother Chinese coast guard ship - the CCG3103 - is heading to the area and was likely to serve as a replacement vessel for the monster ship to maintain China's illegal presence within the exclusive economic zone, it said.\nBesides the CCG5901 and CCG3103, there are at least six other Chinese coast guard vessels in the waters in which the Philippines holds jurisdiction rights to resources.\nThe Monster had been operating in an area 60-70 nautical miles from Zambales for the previous four days, according to spokesperson Jay Tarriela, who said that coast guard vessel BRP Cabra was deployed to closely monitor the illegal Chinese ship.\nChina has provocatively deployed a People's Liberation Army Navy helicopter, tail number 47 to the area, Tarriela said in a statement. The Philippine coast guard has been ordered by its commandant to refrain from action that could escalate tension, he added.\nThe Philippine military on Tuesday confirmed that it would continue conducting maricreated_at and air patrols in the West Philippine Sea, or part of the South China Sea under Manila's jurisdiction.\nThe Global created_ats, a Chinese newspaper known for its hawkish stance, said the Philippines was hyping up the CCG5901's normal activities.\nChinese analyst Ding Duo was quoted as saying that after China announced the baselines around Huangyan Dao, the Chinese name for Scarborough Shoal, both the Chinese navy and coastguard were set to increase their routine patrols and exercises in the area, and the Philippines needs to adapt to this process.\nThat meant the current campaign, seen by Manila as an illegal act of intimidation, was set to continue.\nU.S. aircraft carrier\nMeanwhile, a carrier strike group led by the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70), has been operating in the South China Sea since Jan. 3.\nThe strike group includes the embarked Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2, cruiser USS Princeton (CG-59) and destroyers USS Sterett (DDG-104) and USS William P. Lawrence (DDG-110).\nThe U.S. Navy has released a number of photos showing the Carl Vinson and its accompanying vessels conducting daily routine operations to reaffirm freedom of navigation in the waterway.\nIt did not specify the carrier's exact location and only said that it was in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations.\nU.S. forces operate in the South China Sea on a daily basis, the 7th Fleet has repeatedly said in its statements. The United States upholds freedom of navigation for all nations as a principle.\nNo member of the international community should be intimidated or coerced into giving up their rights and freedoms, it said.\nBesides the Carl Vinson strike group, U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Higgins (DDG 76) was also spotted conducting a firearms shooting training for its sailors on Tuesday in the South China Sea.\nThe Philippines and the U.S. in 1951 signed a Mutual Defense Treaty that commits the allies to help each other in created_at of attack by a third party.\nSource: Radio Free Asia\n"

    "text": "\nThe People's Liberation Army chief of joint staff, Liu Zhenli, has called on Malaysia's top leadership and military brass during his first overseas trip, with both sides pledging closer defence ties and dialogue on issues ­including the contested South China Sea. \nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim hailed the \"strong\" development of ties with China, as he met Liu in the administrative capital Putrajaya on Wednesday, according to the defence ministry in Beijing.  \n\"[We] hope that the defence departments and militaries of the two countries will further enhance exchanges at all levels and elevate defence and security cooperation to a new height,\" Anwar was quoted as saying in a readout released yesterday.  \nLiu said China was willing to deepen military-to-military exchanges and cooperation in various fields. He also had separate meetings with the Malaysian defence minister and defence forces chief in Kuala Lumpur.  \nThe two sides exchanged views on regional security, military information and cooperation on training and joint operations, according to Malaysian national news agency Bernama.  \nMalaysian Defence Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin highlighted past dialogue on the management of maricreated_at issues in the South China Sea, and said that such a diplomatic approach would continue to ensure issues between Malaysia and China were properly addressed, Bernama reported.  \nLiu is a war hero and China's youngest top general to be named chief of joint staff. Malaysia is his first overseas stop since he was promoted to the role in late 2022 at the age of 58. \nHe also sits on the powerful six-member Central Military Commission, the PLA ­decision-making text chaired by President Xi Jinping.  \nLiu has also been involved in high-level diplomacy, including holding an ice-breaking video call in December 2023 with his US counterpart General Charles Brown.  \nLiu's visit comes as Malaysia ramps up ties with China with a series of high-level exchanges. \nAnwar has visited China three created_ats since taking office in November 2022, most recently two months ago. Premier Li Qiang also visited Malaysia in June.  \nDuring a meeting with Xi in Beijing in November 2023, Anwar said that the two countries shared \"similar ideas and close positions on many major international and regional issues\". Xi, for his part, called on both sides to \"enhance political trust and firmly support each other's core interests and major concerns\". \nChina has been Malaysia's top trading partner globally since 2009. However, territorial disputes in the South China Sea are still a complicating factor, although criticism from the Malaysian government is rare.  \nBeijing's expansive claims over the resource-rich waters overlap also with Malaysia's fellow Asean members Vietnam, Brunei and the Philippines, a US treaty ally.  \nClashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in particular have heightened tensions in the region over the past year. Vietnam has also formally accused Chinese law enforcement personnel of assaulting its fishermen in disputed waters. \nThe Chinese and Malaysian militaries do not hold regular joint drills - the last bilateral exercise was in 2015. Their latest multilateral cooperation included the \"Peace and Friendship\" exercise held in Guangdong province in 2023, alongside the military forces of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam.  \nHowever, a Malaysian port call by two PLA Navy ships last October sparked criticism within the country, with the opposition alleging that Malaysia was sending the wrong message to its Asean peers amid the South China Sea tensions.  \nThe Malaysian government dismissed the concerns, saying such visits by foreign military ships were a \"normal occurrence\".\n"

    "text": "\nThe recent Philippines' US missile deal comes amid growing South China Sea tensions and rising fears over a Taiwan conflict. What will it accomplish?\nMaricreated_at tensions are rising in the South China Sea, as the Philippines moves forward with plans to purchase a mid-range Typhon missile system from the United States.\nChina appears visibly alarmed by the decision. In recent weeks, Beijing has accused Manila of placing its national security considerations in the hands of Washington, and also warned Manila against stoking an \"arms race\" in Southeast Asia.\nIn Washington's view, the Philippines' proximity to Taiwan also opens up the possibility of future missile deployments in what China sees as dangerously close range.\nBoth China and the Philippines have been clashing over rights to the South China Sea – a critical global trade seaway.\nChina is opposing the plan of the Philippines to acquire the Typhon Mid-Range Capability missile system, a weaponry that the United States recently deployed in Manila. \n— Joviland Rita (@jovilandxrita) November 15, 2024\nChina claims control over almost all of the sea, though the Permanent Court of Arbitration - a non-United Nations intergovernmental organisation - found \"no legal basis\" for Beijing's assertions in 2016.\nManila views this ruling as confirmation of its own sovereign rights, and sees the new missile system - which is capable of hitting targets in China - as critical to its territorial and maricreated_at defense.\nMaricreated_at tensions have surged in recent months as both sides accuse each other of breaching territorial waters, raising fears of violent confrontations and future escalation.\nSo is Manila's pursuit of the US Typhon system really self-defence, or part of a broader US effort to prepare against a possible Chinese attack on Taiwan?\nMustering resolve\nConsidering Manila's desire to boost its deterrence capabilities, the system should help with the country's self-defence.\nFilipino forces are already familiar with the system and have experience training with it. It has been deployed for months as part of joint military exercises with the US, and serves as an important contributor to Manila's Comprehensive Archipelagic Defence (CAD) strategy, a defence plan that puts a premium on safeguarding Manila's maricreated_at interests.\nEditors' picks for 2024: Military challenges to Beijing's South China Sea claims are increasing | Joe Keary |  pic.twitter.com/lEtmbUUhRB\n— ASPI (@ASPI_org) January 2, 2025\nChina already has a significant missile strike advantage, making it vital for Manila to move beyond small-range missile systems and extend its attack range as far as 1,600 kilometers.\nA detailed assessment in the US army's Military Review estimated over 2,200 ballistic and cruise missiles in China's arsenal, declaring its rocket force as \"the largest ground-based missile force in the world.\"\nThe US Typhon could make it easier for Manila to transfer its batteries to many attack sites in the region. It also offers the unique advantage of rapid deployment during any high-stakes crisis.\nJay Batongbacal, who directs the Institute for Maricreated_at Affairs and Law of the Sea at the University of the Philippines, told TRT World that the US Typhon is part of the broader modernisation and longer-term defence strategy of the Philippines, which began with the acquisition of smaller Spike NLOS and Brahmos systems.\n\"China's increased aggressiveness and belligerence has helped convince the armed forces of the need to acquire missile capabilities as soon as possible,\" he said.\nManila's role in a Taiwan contingency\nFor its part, one motivation for the US to sell this weapon system to the Philippines involves Taiwan.\nThe US feels it could use Manila as a staging ground if China goes to war with Taiwan. But Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr has consistently reaffirmed his country's rigid One-China policy on Taiwan, and is wary not to antagonise Beijing.\nUS cannot use Philippines to store arms meant for defending Taiwan, Manila say\n— South China Morning Post (@SCMPNews) April 19, 2023\nManila has good reason to hold its ground.\nStepping on China's Taiwan redline could drag Manila into a broader conflict with Beijing, an outcome that could easily exhaust the Philippines' limited maricreated_at resources, and risk the safety of thousands of Filipino workers hosted in Taiwan.\nEven though Manila has given the US access to three key military sites in close proximity to Taiwan, this does not necessarily signal unmitigated support during a Taiwan contingency.\nThe Philippines is keen to communicate its sense of agency to China, and has declined past US support for South China Sea operations to avoid escalation. The US Typhon system, which is capable of launching missiles into mainland China, raises the stakes for Manila to walk an even tighter rope on Beijing.\n,,\nThe Philippines needs better defensive capabilities from the US to prevent a Taiwan-related conflict from spilling over into its waters and territory.\n\"By acquiring the missile system, the Philippines could demonstrate that its use, if it happens, serves its national interests primarily rather than the interest of a major power (the US),\" Muhammad Faizal Bin Abdul Rahman, a research fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, told TRT World.\n\"The Philippines needs better defensive capabilities from the US to prevent a Taiwan-related conflict from spilling over into its waters and territory,\" he added.\nDe-escalation efforts\nBacking the US in a Taiwan contingency could also put difficult maricreated_at de-escalation talks on even thinner ice. Defending the missile system, Philippines' Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro recently called on China to end its provocative actions in the Sea, while Beijing calls on Manila to change course or risk \"hurting its own interests.\"\nThe sharp exchange underscores conflicting viewpoints on the system's utility, and it is in Manila's interests to limit Beijing's skepticism of its use. Violent clashes last year have shown that maricreated_at consultations with China, however tense, remain a critical fallback option for Manila.\nBacking the US in a Taiwan contingency could put that track at risk, and weaken Manila's claim that the Typhon \"is not targeted\" against any particular country.\n\"China seeks not only to control the seas adjacent to the Philippines coastline but the narrative around its actions and the Philippines' response,\" Chris Gardiner, chief executive officer of the Australia-based Institute for Regional Security, told TRT World.\nGardiner argues that China could project Manila's actions as irresponsible, especially when the Philippines turns to its allies and friends to support it in the defence of its sovereignty.\nThus understood, Manila's pursuit for the US Typhon system is largely driven by self-defence needs, and should not be seen as an endorsement of US interests in a Taiwan contingency.\nThe latter could pull Manila into a full-blown armed conflict, complicate maricreated_at de-escalation, and invite spillovers, all of the outcomes that Manila is keen to avoid.\n"

    "text": "\nWith just a few weeks left in office, US President Joe Biden has been wasting no created_at in desperately trying to check China's rise. In the latest such move on Monday, the US Defense Department added Tencent, a social media and gaming giant, and CATL, the world's largest battery maker, to a list of Chinese companies which Pentagon alleges work with the Chinese military.\nThe US administration has put 134 Chinese enterprises, including shipping giant COSCO and oil company China National Offshore Oil Corp, on the blacklist. Almost all the 140 companies included in the Entity List, a blacklist for export control announced by the US Commerce Department in December, are Chinese owned, including some Chinese-owned enterprises based in Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore.\nOn Dec 23, the US Trade Representative announced the launch of a Section 301 investigation into China's semiconductor industry, accusing it of causing harm to US trade and national security.\nHowever, such reckless actions are not new. The Biden administration has been using \"national security\" as an excuse to wage an economic war against China. Its strategy of \"vigorous competition\" with China is simply another name for curtailing China's economic and technological rise by using all means possible.\nUsing the same absurd logic, the Chinese government could easily blacklist many US companies for working closely with the Pentagon or claim they pose a national security threat. But I'm glad that the Chinese government has refused to stoop as low as the Biden administration.\nIt's another matter that Biden officials are shamelessly proud of their track record of torpedoing China's rise.\nIn an exclusive interview with The New York created_ats on Jan 4, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken explained how the Biden administration had ganged up with the United States' European allies against China. Though he did not elaborate, it became clear that the US played a role in halting the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment.\nChina and the European Union concluded the CAI negotiations in principle on Dec 30, 2020, about three weeks before Biden took office. The CAI, if ratified, would have opened up a huge market and created more investment opportunities for EU companies, according to European Commission trade officials who took part in the seven-year-long talks.\nUndermining China's rise and reputation has been a key mission and obsession of senior US officials. During a trip to India this week, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan repeatedly mentioned China in a negative tone while delivering a speech at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, in a bid to drive a wedge between the two Asian neighbors. The latest signs of warming between the world's two most populous countries must have driven the Biden administration to spend sleepless nights.\nThe same is true for the warming relations between China and Japan, and China and the ROK. Blinken just concluded his visit to the two countries in what could be his last overseas trip as the US' top diplomat.\nAccording to US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller, Blinken and Japanese leaders discussed the \"PRC's dangerous and destabilizing behavior in the South China Sea\" and both sides \"reiterated the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait\".\nThere is no doubt that the US has been dictating its European and Asian allies for decades. And yet the US has added fuel to the fire — and is playing with fire — by, among other things, announcing more than $800 million in military aid and arms sales to Taiwan in late December — the 19th round of such sales and assistance during Biden's term in office.\nOne thing is clear: Compared with the US, China has far more interest in maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Safe shipping in the South China Sea is far more important for China, the largest trading nation in the world, than any other country.\nHistory will ultimately prove that the US' efforts to curtail China's rise are an exercise in futility. But for now, it's good that the saboteur Biden administration will soon be out of office.\nchenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn\n \nLink to Image\nChen Weihua\n \n \nLink to Image\n \n \nThe author is chief of China Daily EU Bureau based in Brussels.\n"

The security landscape, both regionally and globally, has grown increasingly complex and unpredictable, marked by a series of turning points,\" Japanese Ambassador Endo Kazuya said in a Stratbase ADRI forum in Makati City.\nAmong these, he said, are China's \"rapid and opaque\" military build-up, repeated unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force in the East and South China Seas, North Korea's escalating and serious military provocations, and the \"alignment among China, Russia, and North Korea\".\nSince assuming his post in Manila, Endo said the South China Sea has remained a \"flashpoint of heightened tensions\" in the region.\nFor the envoy, facing these severe and complex security challenges requires the two states to \"redouble current efforts\" and forge enhanced relations.\nEndo also underscored the importance of a \"regional deterrence\" to ensuring stability in the region.\nMeanwhile, he said Japan's participation in the maricreated_at cooperative activity in the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone in June, August, September, and December last year was testament to its \"tangible demonstrations [and] steadfast dedication to upholding the principles of freedom of navigation and overflight\".\nMilitary access deal\nOnce the Philippine-Japan Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) comes into effect, Endo said the two nations' level of cooperation will also enter a new phase.\nThrough this deal, Endo said the Japan Self-Defense Forces will be able to engage in advanced training with the Armed Forces of the Philippines, particularly in the joint Philippines-US exercises such as Balikatan, Kamandag, and Sama-Sama.\nAs to how soon Tokyo could increase its engagement in the activities, Endo said it would depend on the \"processes of the ratification\".\n\"Japan has been an active participant as observers to the Balikatan and we also need to plan ahead. So, we'll see,\" he told reporters in a separate interview.\nThe Philippine Senate ratified the RAA in 2024, which now awaits the concurrence by the Japanese parliament to take effect.\n\"We hope that the RAA will be concurred by the Japanese Diet at the earliest possible created_at but we are not yet sure when,\" Endo said.\n\"After the concurrence by the Japanese Diet, we will go through some procedural processes and after that it will be officially ratified by both governments and will take into effect,\" he added.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Philippines News Agency.

Chinese Coast Guard vessel 5901 or the monster ship's presence close to Zambales was called an act of 'intimidation, coercion, and aggression' by National Security Council spokesman Jonathan Malaya. Though it was not conducting blocking or dangerous maneuvers, its presence so close to the country was exactly as Malaya called it. This is China's way of telling the government they could go and do whatever they wanted. This is to show just how powerful their Coast Guard fleet is by showing one of their big vessels. And that isn't even a warship.\nChina has been flexing its military might in the region, focusing on intimidating Taiwan. It has used both naval and air assets to intimidate the island. China bristled at US approval to sell Taiwan $2 billion worth of military equipment. The US is a strong ally of Taiwan and serves as a deterrent to Beijing's desire to reclaim the island. We have yet to see how this relationship, including ours, plays out with the incoming Trump administration. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has guaranteed the country it will abide by the Mutual Defense Treaty and labeled its relationship with the Philippines as ironclad. We will see what the next defense secretary will have to say.\nBut incoming president Trump seems more focused on conquering allies than working with them. He insulted former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau by calling him a governor of the 51st state of the US, referring to Canada. He is not removing the possibility of using military force on the sovereign nations of Panama and Greenland to gain control of said countries. He wants to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. These seem to be the priorities of Trump as he retakes the White House on January 20th.\nHe is also filling up his Cabinet with known election deniers, an anti-vaccine proponent, and even racists to boot, so his foreign policy might differ greatly from that of the Biden administration. With China flexing in the South China Sea, let's hope Trump will similarly respond. The Marcos Jr. administration would do well to modernize its military assets to face Chinese intimidation and aggression. There is no question as to Chinese military might, but at the same created_at the country should not be intimidated. The livelihood of many fishermen depends on having the seas free from a bully.\n"

    "text": "\nDonald Trump's second term is shaping up to be the ultimate test, not just for him, but for the resilience of America itself. The world he steps back into in 2025 isn't the one he left. It's a harsher, more chaotic place where alliances fray, adversaries grow bolder, and every decision carries the weight of global consequences. This isn't the stage for lofty slogans about \"American greatness.\" It's a pressure cooker of geopolitical turmoil where the stakes couldn't be higher, and the room for error couldn't be smaller.\nTrump thrives on disruption, and this created_at, the world is serving him just that-a dangerous cocktail of challenges that will test his every instinct. His promises to restore stability and \"win bigly\" are colliding head-on with a reality where diplomacy is outgunned by disorder, and quick fixes are in short supply.\nTake Ukraine. \"I'll end the war in 24 hours!\" he thundered on the campaign trail, making it sound as easy as closing a real estate deal. But the war, now grinding into its fourth year, is anything but simple. North Korean troops are reportedly bolstering Russian forces, and Ukraine, armed with long-range Western missiles, has ramped up strikes deep into Russian territory. The conflict has metastasized into something far more complex than a handshake and a photo-op could ever solve.\nTrump's approach to Ukraine is classic deal-making: reevaluate U.S. aid, put NATO aspirations on the chopping block, and hint at legitimizing Russia's territorial grabs. It's a strategy that has already set off alarms in Kyiv and among America's European allies. But controversy has never fazed him. To Trump, diplomacy is just another art of the deal, and nothing's off the table if it gets him leverage.\nAnd if Ukraine is a calculated game of poker, the Middle East is a full-blown hurricane. The sudden ousting of Bashar al-Assad has upended the region, leaving behind a power vacuum that's sucking in rivals and allies alike. Israel has ramped up operations against Hezbollah, even pushing troops into buffer zones in Syria-a move that's drawn sharp criticism. Turkey, meanwhile, continues its relentless push to sideline Kurdish forces, putting Washington in an uncomfortable squeeze.\nThen there's Gaza, where the fragile hope of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas hangs by a thread. For Trump, the stakes here go beyond just stabilizing the region. Without progress in Gaza, his larger goals-like normalizing ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia or reviving nuclear talks with Iran-look like pipe dreams.\nAnd let's not forget China, America's biggest challenger. If the Middle East is a hurricane, China is a chessboard-and every move escalates the tension. Trump's favorite weapon, tariffs, is back on the table, but the game has changed since 2018. China isn't just playing defense anymore; it's leading in AI, quantum computing, and other cutting-edge fields. And it's more prepared than ever for a trade war.\nRecent military drills in the Taiwan Strait and skirmishes in the South China Sea show that Beijing isn't shy about flexing its muscles. At the same created_at, China's deepening ties with Russia, particularly in supporting its war in Ukraine, create a united front that could outmaneuver Washington on multiple fronts.\nBut the battle isn't just on foreign soil. Domestically, the U.S. is fighting a new kind of war: cyberattacks. Operations like \"Salt Typhoon,\" allegedly orchestrated by Beijing, are exposing vulnerabilities in America's infrastructure and data security. For Trump, these digital battlegrounds could be a chance to innovate-or a minefield of mistakes that could erode trust in his leadership.\nAs Trump returns to the White House, he faces a world where every move matters, and every misstep could reverberate for decades. His second term won't just be about restoring order-it's about redefining America's role in a world that no longer plays by the rules. Can he pull off the ultimate high-wire act, or will the chaos he thrives on finally catch up with him? One thing's for sure: the stakes have never been higher, and Trump wouldn't have it any other way.\nNavigating a Dual Front: China and Russia\nThe burgeoning partnership between China and Russia poses a significant challenge for the United States, creating a dual front that demands attention on multiple levels. Beijing's backing of Moscow strengthens Russia's position in Ukraine, complicating Western efforts to isolate the Kremlin. This alliance isn't confined to the Ukrainian battlefield; it extends into Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, where the two powers leverage their relationship to counterbalance U.S. influence.\nFor Donald Trump, this alliance represents an imposing obstacle. Yet his unconventional methods and willingness to negotiate directly could provide an opportunity to disrupt this growing axis. Trump's bold, unpredictable approach may turn this challenge into an opening, though success would require more than rhetoric-it demands a cohesive strategy that balances pragmatism with resolve.\nThe Middle East: Chaos or Stability?\nIn 2025, the Middle East remains a volatile mix of conflicts, contradictions, and competing interests. For Trump, the region offers both the risk of escalating instability and the potential to reshape alliances. The ongoing battle in Gaza between Israel and Hamas has destabilized the area for over a year, with no end in sight. While whispers of a ceasefire emerge, maintaining any form of peace will be a Herculean task. Israel's insistence on retaining a military presence in Gaza further complicates matters, making this conflict far more than a localized issue. Resolving it is pivotal to Trump's broader goals, including strengthening ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia and reinitiating nuclear talks with Iran.\nThe challenges deepen with Lebanon. A tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has failed to prevent frequent skirmishes, threatening to reignite full-scale conflict. Meanwhile, Iran, weakened but not subdued following the fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, continues to exert influence, complicating Washington's calculus.\nThe ousting of Assad has shattered the balance of power in Syria, leaving a vacuum filled by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a militant group classified as a terrorist organization by many nations. This development has created a diplomatic quagmire for the United States. Engaging with HTS, which seeks international legitimacy, poses a moral and strategic dilemma. Complicating matters further are the conflicting interests of American allies: Israel's military expansion into the Golan Heights and Turkey's threats of a new offensive against U.S.-aligned Kurdish forces. These overlapping yet often contradictory agendas pile additional pressure on the Trump administration to find common ground-or risk widening the fissures.\nThe Balancing Act Ahead\nAs Trump assembles his administration, the composition of his team will define his foreign policy trajectory. The inclusion of hardliners like Marco Rubio signals a confrontational stance toward China, while figures like Elon Musk, with his deep ties to Beijing, add an unpredictable dynamic. Trump's invitation to Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration, whether a calculated move or a high-stakes gamble, underscores his penchant for personal diplomacy and theatrics.\nWith challenges spanning from the dual-front threat of China and Russia to the shifting sands of the Middle East, Trump's second term will test not only his bold promises but also the resilience of American leadership on the global stage. The stakes have never been higher, and the consequences of missteps could reverberate for decades.\nChina: The High-Stakes Chess Game of Global Power\nIf the Middle East is a powder keg, U.S.-China relations are the chessboard where the fate of global dominance is being decided. Donald Trump's second term promises a renewed focus on containing Beijing's growing ambitions, but the clock is ticking against Washington. Over the last decade, China has emerged not just as a competitor, but as a powerhouse in advanced technology, economic influence, and military might, more prepared than ever to challenge the U.S. on every front.\nTrump, never one to back down from a confrontation, has hinted at reigniting the trade war, threatening sharp tariff hikes and even stripping China of its \"normal trade relations\" status. Beijing has wasted no created_at in responding, banning rare earth mineral exports to the U.S.-a calculated move that could fuel inflation and slow down American manufacturing. Tariffs, a signature weapon of Trump's economic arsenal, risk doing more harm than good this created_at around, deepening disruptions in supply chains and inviting retaliatory measures that would entrench the economic standoff.\nFlashpoints and Fractures\nGeopolitical tensions with China are reaching a boiling point. The Taiwan Strait is more than a flashpoint; it's a pressure cooker. Chinese military exercises and near-daily skirmishes with the Philippines in the South China Sea illustrate a growing willingness to flex its geopolitical muscles. Beijing's strategic partnership with Moscow adds another layer of complexity, as it provides support to Russia during the Ukraine conflict, fortifying a bloc that stands in direct opposition to American interests.\nThis dual-front challenge-balancing a fraught relationship with China while contending with its support for Russia-requires more than Trump's trademark unpredictability. It demands a strategy that blends economic leverage with diplomatic nuance, a balancing act that may well define Trump's legacy.\nTariffs: The Double-Edged Sword\nTariffs are Trump's go-to tool, but even his staunchest supporters are beginning to question their effectiveness. If they're wielded simply as a bargaining chip, the economic benefits may never materialize. Instead, Trump's corporate tax cuts could exacerbate the deficit, push up interest rates, and strengthen the dollar-steps that would weaken the competitive edge of American exporters.\nChina, on the other hand, has not only weathered previous trade wars but emerged stronger. It now leads critical industries such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence, outpacing the U.S. in areas that will define the future of global power. To counter Beijing effectively, Trump will need the support of allies, many of whom have been alienated by his tariff policies. Ironically, these same allies are also struggling with the ripple effects of his trade wars.\nTechnology, Cybersecurity, and the Military Front\nChina's ambitions are no longer limited to economic dominance. It's a full-fledged global rival, leveraging its military, technological, and cyber capabilities to reshape the international order. The Taiwan Strait serves as a barometer of tensions; every move Beijing makes or every statement out of Taipei risks setting off a chain reaction that could plunge the region into conflict.\nMeanwhile, the South China Sea has become a theater of daily power plays. U.S. ally the Philippines often finds itself standing alone against Chinese aggression, underscoring the fragility of America's strategic foothold in the region. These flashpoints are not isolated skirmishes-they're a prologue to something far larger, potentially pulling the world toward a global crisis.\nThen there's the cyber battlefield. Beijing's \"Salt Typhoon\" operation has laid bare critical vulnerabilities in U.S. infrastructure and data security. The attack was not just a warning shot; it was a demonstration of capability. For Trump, this new frontier of warfare demands urgent action, from bolstering cybersecurity to crafting smarter diplomatic strategies to counter China's reach.\nThe Battle Ahead\nAs Trump steps into his second term, he faces a China that is more assertive, more prepared, and more determined than ever to rewrite the rules of global engagement. The stakes couldn't be higher, and the consequences of failure couldn't be more dire. It's not just about tariffs, trade deals, or military exercises-it's about shaping the future balance of power in a world increasingly defined by competition between two giants.\nFor Trump, the challenge is clear: to meet China's ambitions with a mix of resolve and creativity, to avoid missteps that could lead to catastrophic escalation, and to prove that America still has the edge in a world where every move counts.\nChina and Russia: A Strategic Axis of Challenge\nThe burgeoning alliance between China and Russia represents a formidable dual front for the United States. Beijing's unwavering support bolsters Moscow's hand in Ukraine, undercutting Western efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically and economically. This partnership, however, extends far beyond the confines of the Ukrainian battlefield. It's a geopolitical force that ripples across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, where China leverages its ties with Russia to expand influence and challenge American dominance.\nFor Donald Trump, this evolving alliance is more than a strategic headache-it's a gauntlet thrown at America's global leadership. Breaking through this axis of power requires ingenuity, adaptability, and an unflinching willingness to negotiate from a position of strength. Trump's unconventional methods and talent for direct deal-making might offer an opening, but the stakes couldn't be higher.\nKey Figures: Hawks, Mavericks, and the Unpredictable\nThe team Trump builds will define his foreign policy as much as his instincts. Hardliners like Marco Rubio, who are expected to take on key roles, signal a combative stance against Beijing. On the flip side, wildcard figures like Elon Musk, with his deep connections to China, could inject unpredictability into the administration's decision-making.\nAnd then there's Trump himself-a leader who thrives on breaking molds and defying expectations. His invitation to Xi Jinping to attend the inauguration, a move either visionary or reckless, reflects his signature flair for turning diplomatic norms upside down. Whether this gesture becomes a masterstroke or a miscalculation depends on the balance Trump strikes between pragmatism and theatrics.\nTrump's second term isn't just another chapter in American politics-it's a high-stakes reckoning. Every move in the Middle East, every decision in the simmering economic and military contest with China, will reverberate globally. This isn't a world where mistakes are easily forgiven. Every step demands precision, and every misstep risks reshaping the balance of power for decades to come.\nReturning to a geopolitical landscape rife with instability, Trump faces challenges that demand both strategic discipline and the boldness to take calculated risks. China has surged past the point of merely catching up with the United States; in many areas, it has already surpassed its rival. Meanwhile, the Middle East remains a tinderbox, where each decision is a wager with unpredictable outcomes.\nYet at the heart of this storm stands Trump, a man defined by his willingness to play for high stakes. His second term is not only a chance to recalibrate American leadership but also a test of his ability to rise above the chaos he so often thrives in. Can he deliver on the promise of restoring order and stability? Or will his presidency become synonymous with the era when chaos became the new status quo?\nThe Reckoning Ahead\nTrump steps into a world that no longer plays by established rules, where allies frequently blur the line between partners and competitors. His leadership will not only be judged by his ability to manage the immediate crises but by the long-term consequences of his decisions.\nThis moment demands everything Trump has to offer-and more. It's a chance to redefine America's global role, to shape a new order in an unpredictable world. Whether Trump fulfills the high expectations of his supporters or becomes a cautionary tale of missed opportunities will depend on his ability to navigate this precarious landscape with skill, vision, and unwavering resolve.\nThe stakes are monumental. The game is unforgiving. And Trump wouldn't have it any other way.\nBaku Network\n"
