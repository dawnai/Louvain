    "text": "\nA prominent leftist party in the Philippines has renewed calls for the removal of US troops, warning that US president-elect Donald Trump's aggressive foreign policy and recent threats against other nations underscore the dangers of a bigger military presence by the United States in the Southeast Asian country. \nHowever, observers say their appeals, and those of other progressive groups, are unlikely to gain traction given overwhelming political and public support for stronger ties between Manila and Washington to counter China's maricreated_at aggression. \nThe Bayan Muna Party, which has consistently criticised the policies of President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr, sounded the alarm after Trump on Tuesday claimed the right to take over Greenland and the Panama Canal and refused to rule out the use of military force to achieve those goals. \n\"The ascendancy of Trump is a reminder that the expanded US military presence in the Philippines poses grave danger to our security and long-term stability in the region,\" Bayan Muna said in a statement. \n\"The Trump administration could use the Philippines as a staging ground to aggressively assert control and hegemony over the Pacific, the West Philippine Sea, and the South China Sea as part of his government's containment policy against China,\" the party said. \nUnder the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which grants the US access to place troops and military equipment at agreed sites in the Philippines, Marcos expanded US military access to nine locations in 2023, including bases near the South China Sea and Taiwan. This builds on the Visiting Forces Agreement, signed in 1999, which sets the terms for US personnel operating in the Philippines. \nIn April last year, the US deployed the Typhon missile launcher in the Philippines for joint exercises. Capable of firing long-range Tomahawk and SM-6 missiles, the system's strategic placement extends US coverage over the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. \nIn addition to Bayan Muna, other leftist groups such as Bagong Alyansang Makabayan and the Gabriela Women's Party have expressed opposition to the US military's presence in the Philippines, citing sovereignty concerns and heightened regional tensions.  \nCongresswoman Arlene Brosas of the Gabriela Women's Party forwarded a resolution in July last year in the Lower House to investigate the presence of the Typhon missile system in Ilocos Norte province and its implications on national sovereignty and regional security. \n\"The deployment of this missile system, and the war games in which it has been used, are all manoeuvres to provoke China. This deepens Philippine involvement in the conflict between the two imperialist powers,\" Brosas said. \nHowever, Carlos Isagani Zarate, a former member of both the House of Representatives and the Bayan Muna party, said a withdrawal of US troops from the Philippines would be very unlikely, as few - if any - members of Congress were willing to challenge Marcos on the issue. \n\"The president embraces a foreign policy that serves US interests so we can expect the same with the Congress. In the Senate, before they were much different. We can say that they are independent. But now they are not opposing the [president's] foreign policy,\" Zarate said. \n\"So, it's clear that our country's foreign policy serves US interests instead of pursuing a truly independent approach. That is the danger. With the next US president, who is a warmonger, we're aligning with his policies. If America goes to war, the Philippines will be expected to support it,\" he added. \nAldrin Alba, a legal expert at the Political Economic Elemental Researchers and Strategists think tank, said Bayan Muna's concerns were speculative. He said the presence of American forces in the Philippines did not violate its sovereignty. \n\"The presence of military of other countries like the US strengthens our position in the West Philippine Sea and deters any aggressive actions from China and the furtherance of any military escalation in the region,\" Alba said. \nBayan Muna and other leftist groups did not have enough political influence to force a shift in Manila's foreign policy, he added. \n\"Based on surveys, Filipinos are still inclined to trust the Western powers more than China, especially with recent issues concerning the aggressiveness of China in the Philippine exclusive economic zone,\" Alba said. \nA nationwide poll by Octa Research released in March last year showed that 73 per cent of 1,200 respondents favoured \"further asserting the Philippines' territorial rights through military action, such as expanded naval patrols and troop presence in the West Philippine Sea\". \nChina claims most of the South China Sea, rejecting rival claims from the Philippines and other countries and a 2016 international ruling that its assertion over the waterway had no legal basis. \n\"The interest of the Philippines must be of primordial consideration in every action of the administration. Such access [granted to the US military] is a calculated move of the administration towards the Philippines' security,\" Alba said. \"We must acknowledge our weaknesses to defend our vast territory and must admit the necessity to support other large countries like the US not only militarily but also the economy.\"  \nLucio Blanco Pitlo III, president of the Philippine Association of Chinese Studies and a research fellow at Asia-Pacific Pathways to Progress, said the escalating rivalry between the US and China had heightened concern among progressive groups in the Philippines. \n\"Due to the current position of EDCA - three sites in northern Luzon and as well the Typhon, this is not a South China Sea issue to them but a Taiwan emergency. So if President Trump takes office this month, it's very uncertain what he will do with Taiwan and the South China Sea,\" he said. \nTrump might either strike a deal with China that could potentially sideline allies or take a much tougher stance against Beijing, he said. \n\"Countries with strong economic ties to China will be affected, such as the Philippines. We are a US ally, but our largest trade partner is China.\"\n"

The two countries also set up 2+2 dialogue mechanism in 2015. \nCopyright (c) 2025. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd. All rights reserved. \n"

    "title": "Indonesia Initiates $450 Million BrahMos Missile Export Deal",
    "created_at": "2025-01-11",
    "text": "\nIndonesia initiates $450 million BrahMos missile export deal: On January 11, 2025, it was reported that Indonesia's defence ministry has formally initiated a $450 million deal to acquire BrahMos missiles from India.As per the sources, the EXIM (Export-Import) Bank was initially scheduled to process the loan to Indonesia. However, this did not materialise.It is pertinent to note that Indonesia had joined the BRICS, an intergovernmental organisation consisting of 10 countries, on January 6 last year. Indonesia’s entry into the BRICS — which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates — paves the way for Indian Rupee-Indonesian Rupiah transactions.This development comes as Indonesia seeks to enhance its military capabilities amid regional tensions, particularly regarding China's assertiveness in the South China Sea. \nThe Indonesian government has communicated its intent through a letter sent to the Indian embassy in Jakarta. Additionally, India is reportedly offering a loan to facilitate this purchase, potentially through the State Bank of India or other national banks.This deal marks a significant step for both nations in terms of defence collaboration. Indonesia will become the second Southeast Asian country to procure the BrahMos missile system, following the Philippines, which previously signed a deal worth approximately $374 million. The BrahMos missile is known for its speed and precision, making it a critical asset for Indonesia as it modernizes its military forces.Political Implications of The DealThe acquisition of BrahMos missiles will significantly bolster Indonesia's military capabilities, allowing it to better defend its territorial integrity, particularly in the South China Sea where tensions with China have been escalating. This development may lead to a more assertive Indonesian posture in regional security matters, potentially altering the balance of power in Southeast Asia.The deal could trigger an arms race in the region, prompting neighbouring countries to enhance their military capabilities in response. Countries like Malaysia and Vietnam may feel pressured to procure advanced weaponry to maintain their strategic deterrence against Indonesia's enhanced military capabilities, thereby increasing regional militarization.Indonesia's strengthening military capabilities may shift the dynamics within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). While ASEAN promotes collective security and cooperation, an arms build-up by one member could lead to divisions or tensions among member states, complicating diplomatic relations and collaborative security efforts.This deal underscores Indonesia's growing defence ties with India, signalling a potential shift in alliances within the Indo-Pacific region. As both nations seek to counterbalance China's influence, their partnership could lead to deeper military cooperation and joint exercises, further solidifying their strategic alignment.The acquisition of advanced missile technology by Indonesia could be perceived as a threat by China, potentially exacerbating tensions in the region. This might lead to increased military posturing by China in response, including naval operations and military exercises near Indonesian waters.NIE\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-11",
    "text": "\n The project signals Tokyo's desire for wider security ties in the region and Jakarta's aim for more joint weapon developments, analysts say   \nIn a move that analysts see as emblematic of Tokyo's shift towards broader security alliances - and Jakarta's quest to bolster its maricreated_at defences - Japan and Indonesia are on the cusp of a landmark agreement to co-develop a warship for the Indonesian Navy. \nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was expected to move the project forward on Saturday during talks with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto in Jakarta. \nAlthough details remain under wraps, experts speculate the design of the warship could draw on the advanced destroyers of Japan's s Maricreated_at Self-Defence Forces, retooled to meet Indonesia's operational needs. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nThe collaboration, analysts say, signals Tokyo's shift towards more strategic partnerships with Southeast Asian nations facing territorial disputes with Beijing. \n\"In the last two or three years, in a strategy laid out by [former] prime minister Fumio Kishida, Japan has been working to strengthen its alliances with like-minded countries, particularly countries in Southeast Asia, to create a coalition against the growing potential of China,\" said Masayuki Masuda, director of Chinese studies at the National Institute of Defence Studies in Tokyo. \nThese partnerships align with Tokyo's push for \"more robust security cooperation\", Masuda told This Week in Asia. \nBoth Japan and Indonesia have territorial disputes with China. Jakarta's involves the Natuna Islands, at the furthest reaches of the South China Sea, while Tokyo's centres on the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, which Japan controls and refers to as the Senkakus. \nOn Tuesday, Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani held talks in Jakarta with his Indonesian counterpart Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin to discuss the proposed warship. \"It is strategically important for Japan to strengthen ties in the defence sector with Indonesia, which has important maricreated_at transport routes such as the Strait of Malacca,\" Nakatani told reporters after the meeting. \nDiscussions on the project began several years ago but stalled under Indonesia's former President Joko Widodo as his government focused on domestic issues, such as the planned relocation of the capital from Jakarta to Nusantara. \nA ban on the export of domestically built warships under Japanese defence policies was another hurdle, but Japan and Indonesia have said they will circumvent the restriction by jointly developing warships, with the first vessel expected to be built in a Japanese shipyard. \n\"The two governments are talking about joint development, but I do not think that is going to be a 50-50 split,\" said Garren Mulloy, a professor of international relations at Daito Bunka University and a specialist in military issues. \n\"To go into a joint development, Japan needs a local partner. That is something that Indonesia has done successfully previously with land systems with Turkey and with ships with South Korea,\" he said. \"In many ways, Indonesia is a world leader in creating these alliances to help build up its own arms industry.\" \nMulloy added that the collaboration would help Japan improve its military development capabilities given that it has previously been limited to smaller-scale projects with partners, such as the development of an anti-submarine warfare helicopter with Britain and Italy. \nJapan is also involved in the early stages of discussions or development in other joint projects. It is working on a next-generation fighter jet with Britain and Italy, and is bidding to work with Australia on a new class of frigate based on the Japan's Mogami-class warships. \nIndonesia's new warship is envisioned as a versatile asset capable of multiple roles, including offshore patrolling and anti-submarine operations, Mulloy said. The launch of the first vessel could be at least three years away, given that discussions between Jakarta and Tokyo are in the preliminary stages, he said. \n\"I expect the Indonesian government would prefer these ships to be built in Indonesia and with as much local content as possible,\" Mulloy added. \nIndonesia has long been careful about forming security alliances and avoided criticising major powers, but analysts say it cannot ignore the threat posed by China's actions and growing assertiveness in the South China Sea. \nWhile Prabowo is trying his best not to become too entangled in the US-China rivalry, Japan perceives Jakarta's dilemma as an opportunity for deeper bilateral cooperation, according to Masuda. \n\"Asean countries have become the focal point of the US-China competition,\" Masuda said, pointing to the intensifying rivalry between the US and China in areas ranging from the South China Sea dispute to tech exports. \"They do not want to choose sides, but they want alternatives as security partners and for economic development.\" \nAs such, Japan could be the go-between security partner for members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations without them having to pick a side in the US-China rivalry, he added. \n\"That is a healthy position to be in and provides them with multiple strategic options.\" \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "created_at": "2025-01-11",
    "text": "\nThe improvements, including a longer airstrip on Thitu Island, will help boost Manila's military presence in the South China Sea   \nThe Philippines is upgrading facilities on Thitu Island, its only inhabited outpost in the disputed Spratly Islands, in a move seen as an effort to catch up with rival South China Sea claimants. \nThe latest annual Philippine budget allocated 1.65 billion pesos (US$27 million) to develop the airport as well as 300 million pesos for work on a sheltered port. \nMore than 1 billion pesos has separately been earmarked for another sheltered port facility on Nanshan Island, which is around 160km (100 miles) east of Thitu Island. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nWhile the upgrades will not dramatically alter the regional balance, analysts said they would help the Philippines boost its limited military reach in the face of Beijing's increasing pressure in the South China Sea. \nThe money will help fund the extension of Thitu's sole airstrip to 1.5km, enough to be used by some variants of the F-16 fighter as well as light combat and transport planes. \nBeijing is likely to watch these developments closely - particularly any access given to Philippine allies such as the United States - and some analysts warned that increased air traffic could increase the risk of collisions between Chinese and Philippine military aircraft. \nThitu Island, known to Manila as Pag-asa and to China as Zhongye, is the largest feature occupied by Manila in the region. It plays host to a coastguard station equipped with radars and other monitoring equipment as well as around 200 civilians. \n\"For the Chinese side, the equation will somewhat change, as it means that the Chinese maricreated_at presence in those contested areas will no longer easily go unchallenged,\" said Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \nKoh said the upgrades would help the Philippine coastguard to challenge Chinese maricreated_at forces in the area, but this brought an increased risk of close encounters and potential escalation. \nHowever, he added it was unlikely Philippine military aircraft would be permanently based on the island; instead, they may use it for temporary stopovers. \nThe island, which is also claimed by Vietnam, sits about 500km (310 miles) west of the Philippine island of Palawan and sits at a strategically important position in the disputed waters. \nZheng Zhihua, an associate professor specialising in maricreated_at affairs at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, said there would be significant concern from Beijing if US forces were able to use the facilities on the island. \nHe added it would prompt a backlash in China because it would be seen as the US interfering in the territorial dispute between China and the Philippines. \n\"Should the expanded airstrip and shelter port accommodate US military aircraft or coastguard vessels, it might shift the strategic pressure in maricreated_at manoeuvres back onto China,\" he said. \nZheng said Manila may undertake more inspections around Chinese-controlled Subi Reef, one of the main Chinese-controlled outposts in the Spratlys, just 22km from Thitu. \n\"Enhanced military capabilities on Thitu Island could lead to heightened frontline face-offs or unintended incidents around Subi Reef,\" he said. \nChinese and Philippine vessels were involved in repeated clashes near disputed features over the past year, including collisions between ships and the use of water cannons by Chinese coastguards. \nIn August, the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources made an aerial inspection of Subi Reef and accused the Chinese side of using flares when its plane was nearby. \n\"With both sides maintaining significant military presences - the Philippines on Thitu Island and China on Subi Reef - any military aircraft flying near the Subi Reef area could provoke responses from the other, leading to potentially dangerous aerial encounters,\" Zheng said. \nBao Yinan, an associate research fellow at the Huayang Centre for Maricreated_at Cooperation and Ocean Governance in Hainan, said the Philippine decision to upgrade its facilities may have been intended to \"provoke trouble\" in unoccupied features nearby such as Iroquois Reef. \nIn March last year, the Chinese coastguard said 34 Filipinos had illegally landed on another such sandbank, Sandy Cay, prompting law enforcement to intervene. The Philippines said the group was made up of scientists studying reef biodiversity in the area. \n\"Constructing a sheltered port on Nanshan Island is a practical decision for Manila, as it lies along the northern supply route connecting Palawan to Thitu Island,\" said Bao. \n\"This upgrade would streamline supply operations and provide a convenient anchorage point for Philippine ships during their journeys.\" \nLucio Blanco Pitlo, president of the Philippine Association for Chinese Studies, said Manila had been a \"laggard\" in improving infrastructures in the Spratlys and was now trying to catch up with rival claimants. \nHe said the Philippines had been one of the first claimants to occupy disputed reefs but any advantage gained from doing this had been \"degraded by decades of non-investment in facilities in its atoll outposts\". \nIn contrast, China finished an extensive island-building programme a decade ago and has been steadily improving the facilities on the territory it holds. \nMeanwhile, Vietnam has recently undertaken a series of reclamation projects, and Malaysia has exploited the tourist potential of the disputed Swallow Reef by turning it into a popular diving destination. \n\"While it makes sense to upgrade facilities in outposts that already have existing infrastructure like Pag-asa and Lawak [the Philippine name for Nanshan], it should start construction on other outposts or lose ground to erosion or other natural forces, or be dwarfed by big island bastions being piled up by other disputants,\" Pitlo added. \nZheng said Manila had learned from last year's encounters with China and is now focusing on areas that are further from the reach of Chinese forces than Sabina Shoal - a major flashpoint in recent months, which is close to Chinese-held Mischief Reef, the biggest outpost in the Spratly chain. \n\"Nanshan Island, being relatively distant from a strong Chinese maricreated_at presence nearby, faces less interference or pressure from the Chinese coastguard ... Upgrades on Nanshan will undoubtedly aid the Philippine coastguard in docking and enhance enforcement capabilities in that area,\" Zheng said. \nCopyright (c) 2025.

His tragic end came on a ship taking him from India to China where he was going to make money to feed his family. He died on the voyage, his text sewn up in a shroud, the last stitch through his nose to make sure he was dead, and cast into the South China Sea.\nNone of this seemed likely when James Augustus Hicky (who may have been born in Dublin   Andrew Otis is not sure) went to India in 1773. India  then was being conquered by the  East India Company in the greatest heist in corporate history, when  company servants made an estimated £15 million in  presents  between  1757 and 1784 (£1.9 billion in today s money). Hicky, despite having no qualifications, had worked as a  surgeon s mate on a ship. He arrived  in Calcutta dreaming of such riches.\nBut after seven years he had  incurred debt which landed him  in jail and he decided to publish  the weekly Hicky s Bengal Gazette, Asia s first newspaper. Readers loved his lighthearted satirical style and campaigns to improve Calcutta s dreadful roads and sanitation. His problems came when he took on  Warren Hastings, governor-general of India, and Sir Elijah Impey, the chief justice and Hastings  friend.\nWhite soldiers, fighting the company s wars, wrote to Hicky about how, unlike their officers, they had not only not shared India s riches but not been paid for months. Armed with this ammunition, he accused Hastings of corruption and even suggested Hastings suffered from erectile dysfunction. The resulting criminal libel actions, presided over by Impey, saw Hicky imprisoned and ruined.\nHowever, Hicky s campaigns resonated in London. Impey and Hastings were tried in parliament, with Edmund Burke leading the prosecution. Both were acquitted, but Hastings s trial was an 18th-century sensation, lasting eight years. Burke s charges that he had  subverted  India s laws, rights and liberties and  whose country he has laid waste and desolate , set the moral standards for British rule in India.\nIronically, Hicky thought Indians were noble savages while Hastings valued Indian laws and customs.\n"

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by the State Council of the People's Republic of China:\nSome museum fans may have paid multiple visits last year, but on average, every Chinese person visited a museum in the country once in 2024.\nAs a document released by the National Cultural Heritage Administration on Friday showed, more than 1.4 billion visits roughly equal to the nation's population were made to museums across the country last year, setting a new yearly record.\nThe popularity of such facilities among the public reflects the fruitful achievements of cultural heritage-related promotional and educational efforts in China.\nAlso, according to the administration, since the 4th national census of cultural relics launched in November 2023, over 93 percent of some 710,000 previously registered \"immovable cultural relics\" defined in China as archaeological sites, historical monuments, ancient architecture, rock carvings and so on had been rechecked nationwide to ensure such ongoing classification by last week. Another 52,000 such relics were newly discovered in the ongoing census, which is expected to last until next year.\nArchaeological work continued to be conducted in an orderly way, demonstrating key progress. In 2024, 259 proactive excavations were initiated to solve crucial academic issues. They focused not only on long-explored landmark sites marking early-stage civilization such as the Yinxu and Erlitou sites in Henan province but also new areas like deep-sea research on two Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) shipwrecks in the South China Sea.\n\"We'll continuously strengthen archaeology and thus better explain Chinese civilization,\" said Li Qun, director of the administration.\nIn preparation for infrastructure construction, another 1,480 excavations were launched last year to better protect heritage sites. More than 10 new museums opened on major archaeological sites.\nThe newest findings on the origins of Chinese civilization were included in the latest versions of history textbooks for elementary and high school students.\nLast year, a total of 36 Chinese cultural relic exhibitions were held abroad, and 211 lost Chinese relics overseas were repatriated on seven occasions from countries including the United States, Japan, Argentina and Italy. China is also drafting national-level guidance concerning cross-border joint archaeological research in the next decade.\n\"(In 2025,) China will promote friendly relations between World Heritage Sites in China and other countries,\" Li said. \"More work will be done to advance the return of key cultural relics to the motherland.\"\nAn exhibition is planned for later this year to showcase the achievements of repatriated Chinese cultural relics since 2012, he added.\n"

    "text": "\n After withdrawing its biggest vessel nicknamed the 'monster ship' from the waters of Zambales, the China Coast Guard (CCG) sent two ships to take over its illegal patrol in the West Philippine Sea, particularly near Panatag Shoal.\nThe arrival of the two Chinese ships with bow number 3103 and 3304 one after the other was detected by the BRP Teresa Magbanua, a 97-meter patrol ship of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).\nThe Teresa Magbanua 'conducted ongoing monitoring of the illegal presence of Chinese Coast Guard vessels exhibiting erratic movements along the coastline of Zambales province, approximately 70-80 nautical miles from shore,' PCG Commodore Jay Tarriela said in a statement.\nThe two CCG vessels replaced the 'monster ship,' which had operated in Philippine waters for four days before sailing away.\n'Despite this change, the objective of the Chinese deployment remains the same: to assert normalization and legitimacy in these waters,' Tarriela said.\nEarlier, the Teresa Magbanua sent a radio challenge to CCG 3304 and asked the foreign vessel to 'depart immediately and notify us of your intentions.'\n'The PCG is steadfast in its mission to counteract these efforts and prevent any normalization of illegal deployment of CCG vessels. Under the guidance of Commandant Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan, the PCG will continue to vigilantly monitor the illegal presence of the Chinese Coast Guard while employing a measured response that prioritizes the Philippines' national interests and aims to avoid escalation,' Tarriela said.\nMeanwhile, National Security Council (NSC) assistant director general Jonathan Malaya said measures are being undertaken to ensure the safety of undersea communications cables in the West Philippine Sea.\n'We recognize the threat and are acting accordingly,' Malaya told The STAR yesterday in reaction to reports of a Chinese-linked cargo vessel supposedly having caused damage to an international underwater cable northeast of Taiwan.\nReports said the Taiwanese government is investigating the incident, which it claimed may be part of 'grey zone' tactics of China.\nMalaya noted that the Philippines is extremely concerned about the possibility of its undersea cables being damaged 'because these cables are crucial for international communication and data transmission, facilitating 99 percent of global data traffic.'\n'Any damage to cables connecting the Philippines to the rest of the world can disrupt the national infrastructure. There are undersea cables connecting the Philippines to (Asia) mainland that pass through the WPS and the rest of the SCS (South China Sea),' he said.\nBut he noted that so far, 'we have not had similar incidents in the country but we need to be vigilant because of the importance of these cables.'\n'Protecting these undersea cables will require an interagency effort, with the Philippine Coast Guard ramping up patrols at sea, the DICT (Department of Information and Communications Technology) and cable operators utilizing advanced sensors to detect potential threats and the cable companies building multiple routes to minimize single point failures,' he said.\n"

    "text": "\n A Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessel has continued to challenge the presence of China Coast Guard (CCG) ships 'exhibiting erratic movements' in Philippine waters off Zambales.\nCommodore Jay Tarriela, the PCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea (WPS), said on Thursday that CCG ships with bow numbers 3103 and 3304 were spotted about 130 kilometers to 148 km off Zambales.\nOn Wednesday, CCG 3103 made intrusive patrols off Zambales, replacing CCG 5901, or China's monster ship, the biggest coast guard vessel in the world.\nBut on Thursday, Tarriela said CCG 3304 was seen off Zambales, replacing CCG 3103.\n'The crew of the BRP Teresa Magbanua persistently radio-challenged the Chinese vessels, informing them that they [were] operating within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ),' he said in a statement.\nThe Teresa Magbanua told the Chinese they were violating Republic Act No. 12064, or the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, as well as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, of which China is a signatory, and the 2016 arbitral award.\n'The crew made it clear that the Chinese vessels do not possess any legal authority to patrol within the Philippines' EEZ and directed them to depart immediately,' Tarriela said.\nHe said PCG commandant Adm. Ronnie Gil Gavan ordered the PCG to 'vigilantly monitor' the illegal presence of the CCG 'while employing a measured response ... to avoid escalation.'\nThis week, the US Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson conducted 'routine operations' in the South China Sea as Beijing's monster ship patrolled the area.\nThe 165-meter China's monster ship first entered Manila's EEZ on Jan. 1 and made intrusive patrols in the vicinity of Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal and off the coast of Zambales.\nImproved PH Navy\nThe Philippine Navy said it has improved its operational readiness and was more capable of conducting operations in the country's EEZ.\nIn an interview on Friday, Philippine Navy spokesperson Cmdr. John Percie Alcos said there are now 'record numbers of operationally ready warships and aircraft that have the capability to conduct naval and maricreated_at operations up to the EEZ.'\nUnder the ongoing modernization program, the navy is expected to receive two brand-new guided missile corvettes and six offshore patrol vessels from South Korean defense contractor HD Hyundai Heavy Industries, and two landing dock platforms from Indonesian shipbuilder PT PAL within the next two to three years.\nThree batteries of the Indian-made Brahmos antiship missiles, which will be operated by Marine units, are also expected to be commissioned soon.\nThe navy is also expected to acquire additional brand-new antisubmarine helicopters to beef up the capabilities of the soon-to-be-delivered guided missile corvettes.\nHe added the navy will pursue its ongoing modernization program and leverage partnerships with like-minded navies. -With a report from PNA\n"

    "text": "\n Can Anwar Ibrahim's diplomatic finesse help Malaysia steer Asean through the storm of rising trade tensions and regional crises?   \nMalaysia takes the helm of Asean at a created_at of see-sawing threats and opportunities, with Donald Trump's tariff-wielding return to the world stage, peaking tensions in the South China Sea and the deepening bloodshed in Myanmar all set to test the diplomatic skill of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. \nFor Anwar, 77, this is a crowning moment in a career that has weathered persecution, imprisonment and decades in opposition. Since taking office in late 2022, he has worked to restore Malaysia's global reputation after years of domestic political turmoil and introspective government. \nHis international outreach has seen him rattle through visits to China, the US, India, Russia and Turkey - to name but a few - signalling his administration's focus on foreign relations and an acute awareness of the security and economic challenges ahead. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nBut will it be enough? Chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations comes with responsibilities that are both symbolic and strategic - hosting key meetings, setting the agenda on pivotal issues including trade, security and disputes, and acting as the region's face in global diplomacy. \nTaken as a whole, the bloc represents the fifth-largest economy on Earth with a combined gross domestic product of US$3.6 trillion, growing at a combined 4.5 per cent in 2024. \nYet its effectiveness remains constrained by consensus-driven decision-making that can render it toothless when it comes to the most pressing issues. Critics have derided Asean as a \"talking shop\" incapable of decisive action, and Malaysia's year in charge is unlikely to escape the same scrutiny. \n\"Chairs will be judged by how they manage - or mismanage - hot button issues, of which there are plenty for Malaysia to juggle this year,\" Thomas Daniel, a foreign-policy analyst from Malaysia's Institute of Strategic and International Studies, told This Week in Asia. \nExternally, Asean faces a wild card in Washington. Donald Trump, set to return to the White House in a matter of days, has threatened sweeping new tariffs on all manner of imports - not just those from China - in a move that could send shock waves through Southeast Asian economies. \nThe transactional nature of his first term is tipped to continue, with investments and defence support on the line for any nation, or region, his hawkish administration perceives to be out of step with US interests. \nCountries like Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia saw an influx of manufacturers fleeing US-China trade tensions during his first term. This created_at, however, Trump's trade wars are expected to target the entire region, potentially dismantling the advantages that had made Asean a magnet for global supply chains and companies relocating to avoid levies on made-in-China goods. \nThe US president-elect campaigned on a pledge to impose tariffs as high as 20 per cent on all imports, especially from countries with large trade surpluses. \n\"Early in the new administration, the Trump White House will indeed impose high new tariffs on a large scale,\" warned Kurt Tong, a former US ambassador for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in a report for the trade-focused Hinrich Foundation think tank. \"It is also clear that Asia, and especially China, will be a top target.\" \nBut there are opportunities amid the uncertainty. As the US appears set on retreating from environmental sustainability commitments, China could emerge as the undisputed leader in green technology, creating potential for Asean to deepen its ties with Beijing. \n\"Asean countries may benefit from Chinese technology, especially in vehicle, energy and food production,\" Azizul Amiludin, an economist and senior lecturer at Universiti Malaya, told This Week in Asia. \nThe US also remains Asean's largest foreign direct investor - pumping in US$476.3 billion in 2023 alone. Malaysia itself has enjoyed much of that influx, with the American Malaysian Chamber of Commerce reporting 172.6 billion ringgit (US$37.5 billion) of FDI that same year, largely stemming from American tech giants like Amazon, Intel and Microsoft setting up shop in the country since Anwar came to power. \nAsean's biggest internal crisis remains Myanmar, still locked in a vortex of violent chaos nearly four years after the junta seized power. Its civil war has spilled across borders, fuelling a surge in human trafficking, drug smuggling and Southeast Asia's worst refugee crisis. \nNeighbouring nations - including fellow Asean members Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia - have struggled to cope with the influx of displaced people, particularly the persecuted Rohingya, as the bloc finds itself split over how to handle an isolated military government assailed by a pro-democracy rebellion. \n\"What's crucial is for Myanmar to return to being a peaceful country where its people can live harmoniously,\" Malaysian Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan said on December 21. But large swathes of the country are now controlled by opposing factions and warlords, and the junta has shown few signs of relinquishing its grip. \nPrevious Asean chair Laos largely sidestepped the issue, \"struggling to find meaningful solutions\", in the words of a report from the Asean Studies Centre at Singapore's ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. \nMalaysia, meanwhile, has shown willingness to take a harder line. In 2022, it became the first Asean member to engage with Myanmar's civilian National Unity Government after then-Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah chastised the junta for blocking conflict resolution efforts. \nAll eyes will now be on Anwar's administration - in particular Hasan and newly appointed Special Envoy to Myanmar Othman Hashim - to see if it will push for a stronger stance or fall back into Asean's default mode of cautious diplomacy. \nFurther complicating the issue is Anwar's recent appointment of former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra as a personal adviser on Asean matters. Thaksin advocated for a previous Myanmar junta during his created_at in office and his ties to the country's generals have raised eyebrows among activists. \n\"This decision sends a troubling message to the people of Myanmar, who have hoped for a stronger Asean stance under Malaysia's leadership,\" said Salai Ling, deputy executive director of the Chin Human Rights Organisation that aims to support marginalised groups in the war-torn nation. \nThen there's the South China Sea, where China's increasingly aggressive stance has split Asean members into opposing camps. Nations like Vietnam and the Philippines, which have the most to lose, are pushing back hard against Beijing's sweeping territorial claims. Others, including Cambodia and Laos, remain reluctant to challenge their largest trading partner. \nMalaysia, for its part, has struck a delicate balance, maintaining cordial ties with China while quietly resisting its encroachments. A leaked diplomatic cable last year revealed that Beijing had made threats against Malaysia's oilfields in contested waters. Yet Anwar has played down the tensions, insisting that Malaysia has no problems with China. \nThis is in stark contrast to the Philippines, which has pushed back against continual harassment from Chinese coastguard vessels and militia ships, buoyed by its mutual defence treaty with Washington - a pact that also risks dragging the US into any future conflict should animosities escalate. \nStill, Malaysia plans to use its chairmanship to push for a long-awaited code of conduct in the South China Sea, Defence Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin said during a November meeting with Chinese Ambassador Ouyang Yujing. This procedural framework is designed to prevent conflicts, but years of negotiations have produced little progress. \n\"The limited progress underscores the US' continued role as a strategic counterweight for nations such as the Philippines and Vietnam,\" said Hafidzi Razali, CEO and founder of public affairs, policy advisory and strategic communications firm Strategic Counsel. \nAs Malaysia navigates this treacherous diplomatic terrain, analysts say Anwar's personal charisma and international network will serve as key assets. \n\"His international network is impressive, and he's been able to endear himself to other state leaders,\" said Tunku Mohar Mokhtar, a political analyst from the International Islamic University in Kuala Lumpur. \nWhile mostly focused on trade and wooing investors to return to Malaysia following the upheavals of the 1MDB scandal, Covid-19 pandemic and Trump's first trade war, Anwar has also used the global stage to push for other agendas, particularly in his advocacy for Palestinians amid the indiscriminate slaughter of the Gaza war. \n\"Anwar is friendly with leaders in the West and the East and is brave enough to express his stance without necessarily insulting his targets,\" Tunku Mohar said. \nThe Malaysian leader has also presided over his country becoming a partner nation of Brics, a coalition of major emerging economies spearheaded by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa that represents over 40 per cent of global GDP and is expanding in a challenge to Western-led multilateral frameworks. \nEconomists have voiced scepticism about the benefits of joining Brics, which encompasses diverse geographies, demographics and somecreated_ats conflicting interests. \n\"This lack of cohesion makes it difficult to predict the economic benefits for member countries,\" said Doris Liew from the Institute of Democracy and Economic Affairs (IDEAS) Malaysia. \nStill, Asean's largest economy, Indonesia, became the latest full Brics member this week, the bloc's current chair Brazil announced on Monday. Malaysia and Thailand both became Brics partners following a summit in Kazan, Russia last October. \nUniversiti Malaya economist Azizul said Brics could provide Asean member states with leverage in international negotiations, such as those with the European Union over its ban on palm oil due to deforestation concerns. \n\"Asean as an organisation however, may be wary of formalising any grouping arrangement with Brics as it balances US-China geopolitical interests in the region,\" he said. \nFor his part, Anwar has pushed for Asean to become more of an international player, influencing world affairs. \n\"Southeast Asia's ambition reaches beyond its borders, striving to be a force for positive change on the global stage,\" he said in an opinion piece published by Project Syndicate on December 16. \nTo that end, Malaysia aims to bolster engagement with Brics, as well as Asean's external partners - such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - calling it \"essential\" as a signal of the bloc's intent to expand economic and strategic networks. \nAnwar's task will be made all the more challenging by Asean's code of \"centrality\" - the idea that member countries work together to shape decisions in the region - which often masks rifts and a lack of cohesion as member countries focus on their own interests. \n\"Only a cohesive, united and institutionally strengthened Asean can be effectively 'central' in an emerging global order that is fragmented and transactional,\" ISIS Malaysia's Thomas said. \nIn his December commentary, Anwar underscored the importance of Asean seizing the moment. \n\"The choice is stark: Asean must move forward in unity or face the divisive forces gathering momentum across Asia and beyond,\" he said \nBut the strength of those \"divisive forces\" is yet to be fully revealed. \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "text": "\nIn early December 2024, The University of Hong Kong (HKU) hosted a lucid dialogue entitled: \"China in 2050 – Two Perspectives\". The presenters were recognized China scholars, Professor Rana Mitter of Harvard University and Professor Daniel Bell from HKU. \"What might be a realistic and desirable future for China\" was a primary question addressed. Although the focus was fundamentally on China, the discussion implicitly raised the question of where the United States may find itself in 2050.\nChina\nAs Mitter began the presentation, he explained he was drawing on research for a forthcoming article. He then outlined five key factors that should be considered in thinking through how China's future development may be shaped.\nFirst, he highlighted the way that a serious study of Chinese history revealed regular, to-and-fro pulsations between more and less liberalism. Controlling adjustments occurred as threats to stability were perceived. While enhanced stability, in turn, created scope for movements towards greater social choice.\nNext, he stressed how China's influence on pivotal concepts shaping global interaction and development was already significant. The growing importance of what he called \"authoritarian welfarism\", where the state adopts a primary role in driving massive community betterment, was already established as one proved alternative to Western developmental paradigms.\nThird, he spoke about the huge climate change challenges facing the world and the way that China was now doing so much to lead the green energy revolution, thus strengthening its global influence, with each passing year, in this vital sphere. He compared this role to the way that Japanese car-makers revolutionized the concept of what a \"good car\" was around 50 years ago by producing reliable, frugal, robust, lower cost mass market automobiles.\nFourth, he spoke about the general, global hi-tech revolution and how China's extensive base-building in education and manufacturing development, inter alia, had given it a measurable head start. He added that forward-looking adaptability should help Chinese enterprises avoid the fate of Nokia and Ericsson, which lost their leading mobile-phone position to the new wave of smartphones.\nFinally, Mitter observed how the positive potential outlined in these first four, future-shaping elements, could be negated by the fifth key factor: serious conflict over Taiwan region or the South China Sea. This, he argued, had the potential to crater the economy. He did not have created_at to examine in detail how this might come to pass, nor who might be most likely to trigger any such hot war and why.\nBell, who was previously a dean at Shandong University in China before taking up his position in the Faculty of Law at HKU, began by explaining how he sought to lessen the need for him to speculate by \"looking back from 2050\" at what had unfolded over the previous 25 years.\nHe observed how China had, consistent with its avoidance of warfare since 1979, continued to shun military conflict as far as possible notwithstanding significant provocations. It had also (predicted by 2035) harnessed the potential of Artificial Intelligence to deliver benefits to all the population and not just to fortunate segments thereof. Gradually, but finally, the US and China had agreed to work together to address the profound threats posed by climate change and global pandemics, for example.\nBeijing had also introduced greater democracy into the operation of the Communist Party of China and, taking a lesson from ASEAN, a new East Asian Union, drawing in South Korea and Japan, had taken shape, which had helped pave the way for a form of cross-strait reconciliation with its Taiwan region. Meanwhile, fresh leadership in the two Koreas had eased tensions there.\nOthers, including the presenters, may differ over some observations set out in my synopsis. It is, however, fair to say that the central themes of the dialogue provided a critically informed but mainly positive assessment of what the next 25 years may hold for China.\nAmerica\nThe United States is the world's paramount superpower. It is recognized for its extraordinary accomplishments which are underpinned by exceptional natural and human resources. These achievements stand on the shoulders of previous, substantial European reliance on slavery and the devastation of the native American population, but they remain unmistakable.\nAmerica is blessed with a major share of the very best universities worldwide. And it continues to attract millions of would-be migrants, including many outstanding scholars and researchers.\nThese are all pivotal factors informing how the 2050 outlook for the US may be shaped. But they are, today, a fading component in America's future-shaping, collective behavior, which is increasingly dominated by the US propensity to seek extreme military solutions to the geopolitical challenges it faces. This primary, internal menace to American well-being was highlighted more than 60 years ago, when US President Dwight Eisenhower, delivering his farewell address to the nation observed that:\n\"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\"\nMany, including former US President Jimmy Carter, have since highlighted how the US is the most warlike country ever seen in world history.\nUnsurprisingly, the US wields grossly over-developed military power that has spread around the globe and which eclipses all other military spending by a colossal margin. According to the Global Firepower Index, the US ranks first amongst 145 countries and it has maintained this leading position for 18 consecutive years. Moreover, during the Biden administration the US embrace of warfare solutions has intensified alarmingly.\nIan Bremmer of the Eurasia group recently argued, that \"the United States versus itself\" was the biggest challenge faced by America in 2024, adding that:\n\"The world's most powerful country faces critical challenges to its core political institutions: free and fair elections, the peaceful transfer of power, and the checks and balances provided by the separation of powers. The political state of the union … is troubled indeed\".\nConclusion\nIn January 2023, Professor Yuen Yuen Ang of Johns Hopkins University in the US reasoned in The New York created_ats that:\n\"China has its own set of tremendous problems, just as the United States has. And at the end of the day, to me, what the U.S.-China competition is really about is which of these two countries are going to make use of their political system to solve problems of capitalism. That is the real competition.\"\nOver 10 years ago, the leading English political philosopher, John Gray, in his then new book, The Silence of Animals, maintained that:\n\"In America more than anywhere else the belief that each person's life can be a story of continuing improvement has been a part of the psyche. In the new economy, where a disjointed existence is the common lot, this is a story that makes no sense. When the meaning of life is projected into the future, how are people to live when the future can no longer be imagined? The rise of the Tea Party suggests a retreat into a kind of willed psychosis, with populist demagogues promising a return to a mythical past.\"\nIn December 2024, CBS News reported that Elon Musk spent US$277 million to back the successful election of President Trump and other Republican candidates all wedded to a promise \"to return to a mythical past\".\nAs we look towards 2050, both China and the US face fundamental difficulties in \"solving the problems of capitalism\". In America, present evidence confirms that this forward-looking project is gravely endangered by entrenched, adversarial political recklessness. Fortunately, in Beijing, a much more positive view of the future prevails. Dangerous political impulsiveness is also measurably more constrained by the active review of experience drawn from several thousand years of continuous civilization.\nRichard Cullen is an Adjunct Professor in the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong.

    "title": "PRESS CONFERENCE BY PRIME MINISTER ISHIBA REGARDING HIS VISIT TO MALAYSIA AND INDONESIA AND OTHER MATTERS",
    "created_at": "2025-01-11",
    "text": "\nThe following information was released by the office of the Prime Minister of Japan:\n(On Prime Minister Ishiba's impressions as he wrapped up his visit to Malaysia and Indonesia; on the outcomes attained during this trip and on future issues from the standpoint of responses to China; also, in regard to diplomacy with the United States, in light of third-party comments that President-elect Trump has only limited interest in Southeast Asia and against a backdrop of uncertainty emerging in regional security, on the U.S.'s relationship with the Southeast Asia region and on the current state of affairs of coordinating a meeting with Mr. Trump)\nWithin Japanese diplomacy, our relationship with ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is of the utmost importance. In the context of the increasing uncertainty we see in the international situation, my perception is that, as Japan engages in diplomacy going forward, it is absolutely imperative for us to build up our relationship with Southeast Asia while fostering relations of trust.\nTaking this view of matters, I intend to visit each of the countries of the Southeast Asia region individually, separate from international meetings such as ASEAN-related meetings or APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) meetings. In selecting my destinations for this trip, I decided to visit the two countries of Malaysia, a country experiencing remarkable growth, and Indonesia, which has also achieved exceptional growth and is one of the world's most prominent nations in terms of both the size of its population and the scale of its economy.\nI consider it immensely important that both countries have economies achieving highly impressive growth and both are Islamic countries.\nI engaged in various exchanges of views with Prime Minister Anwar during my created_at in Malaysia and with President Prabowo during my stay in Indonesia. In each case, we spent considerable created_at talking one on one, and we also participated in small group and expanded meetings.\nFirst of all, in the area of security, my counterparts and I agreed we will advance our cooperation in concrete form through Official Security Assistance (OSA) and maricreated_at security cooperation. This cooperation with Indonesia and with Malaysia is, in other words, something bringing peace and stability to the Southeast Asia region, which ultimately also makes a tremendous contribution to the peace and security of Japan. This can be called security -- security within the realm of defense. That is the first point.\nThe second point is energy security, which is exceedingly important for Japan. Japan has built up mutually beneficial relationships with regard to the supply of energy over quite a long created_atline, notably in the supply of LNG (liquefied natural gas). My counterparts and I saw fully eye to eye in continuing this into the future.\nTaking this visit as an opportunity, we also confirmed our intention to work towards decarbonization via various means, including through the use of hydrogen, ammonia, CCUS (carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage), geothermal energy, and mineral resources, among others, with AZEC (the Asia Zero Emission Community) serving as the axis for our efforts.\nWe also had a considerable exchange of views regarding cooperation in the areas of food security and agriculture, forestry, and fisheries.\nMy fellow leaders and I also discussed relations with the United States of America, relations with China, and various outstanding concerns such as our assessments of the current state of affairs, as well as the situation in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, along with other matters. We were fully in accord in our stance that Japan must continue to engage in close communication with both Malaysia and Indonesia. We will act in cooperation in order to maintain a free and open international order.\nIt was my first visit to both of these countries in 34 years. Last created_at, as a second-term Diet member, I visited on an overseas observation tour organized by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Youth Division. It was 34 years ago that I came here with others in the Youth Division, including fellow then-second-term legislator Mr. TOKAI Kisaburo, now Chairman of the Political Reform Headquarters (of the LDP), and Mr. SUZUKI Shunichi, now Chairman of the General Council (of the LDP), then in his first term in the Diet.\nI have felt quite amazed and also moved at the way both countries have achieved such phenomenal development. Going forward, it will be imperative for Japan to make greater efforts to strengthen our relations with both countries, whether we consider energy, security in terms of defense, or food security.\nThere are a great many things that Japan can do on behalf of these two countries. There are also numerous areas in which Japan would like to receive assistance from these two countries. This is not simply a matter of the economy; relationships of trust are also of extreme importance. I imagine you in the media covering my visit here may have also felt this while you were here, but the question is, does Japan regard Malaysia and Indonesia as highly as those two countries regard Japan? The expectations towards Japan are really quite intense.\nEconomic development has certainly been quite profound, but the expectations held towards Japan are also exceptionally strong. And yet how much do we in Japan recognize and value these two countries? I have felt very keenly that there are a number of points we need to rethink.\nThere was a question about relations with the United States. The next president, Mr. Trump, will be taking office soon. For Japan, our relationship with the United States is of the utmost importance. Accordingly, I intend to have a meeting with Mr. Trump at the nearest possible created_at, taking into account our schedules on both sides.\nAs for the degree to which Mr. Trump is interested in the Southeast Asia region, I will have to actually have discussions with him to see. That said, seeing during this visit the way in which both Malaysia and Indonesia have developed, I really think that being diplomatically engaged in this region going forward is of the utmost consequence for Japan and for the United States as well. I'd like Mr. Trump and I to share the recognition that Japan and the U.S. joining hands in cooperation to help bolster the peace and stability of this region also contributes tremendously to the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region as a whole, as well as the peace and stability of the entire globe.\n(On how Prime Minister Ishiba intends to face and engage with opposition parties as the ruling party with responsibility once the ordinary Diet session begins; on how the Ishiba administration will, during the upcoming ordinary Diet session, take on the issues of the electoral system, the system of married couples using separate surnames, and donations from corporations and organizations; and on the possibility of holding elections for both Houses of the Diet on the same day and the potential for forming a grand coalition with opposition parties)\nMy administration's stance during the upcoming ordinary Diet session will be no different than the stance we took during the extraordinary session of the Diet. Insofar as we are a minority ruling party, there is no change in the circumstances that there is no way for a bill or draft budget to pass without the support of members of opposition parties. We would like a large number of opposition party legislators to agree with us, and towards that end, we need to have those who supported opposition parties think, \"what the government is proposing is the most reasonable,\" or else we won't be able to win the support of legislators in opposition parties. We are not asking them to accept everything we offer without reservation. But for those supporting opposition parties or independents without any party affiliation, we will offer thoroughgoing explanations of our positions so that they arrive at the conclusion that \"what the government has proposed makes the most sense.\"\nAs for the issues of the electoral system, the system of married couples using separate surnames, and donations from corporations and organizations, it is important to first have the various political parties and factions hold sincere discussions, so at present, we as the government will not say anything that prejudges the outcome of those discussions. Once earnest discussions are held and an outcome is reached, the government will take all necessary responses. That is how we will approach this.\nAs for holding elections for both Houses of the Diet on the same day -- a \"double election,\" as they say -- and as for forming a grand coalition, if you take a look at the transcripts of all the press conferences I've done, or the records of all my remarks, nowhere will you find that I uttered even the first letter of the words \"grand coalition,\" nor will you find me anywhere uttering so much as the first letter of the words \"double election\" even a single created_at. Never once have I so much as breathed either phrase. That being the case, insofar as we are a minority ruling party, I have said that we need to gain substantial support from outside the ruling parties.\nWith regard to dissolving the House of Representatives, while I have indeed confirmed the provisions for dissolution under the Constitution, again, nowhere have I articulated even the first part of the first syllable of either a \"grand coalition\" or a \"double election.\"\nIn each and every circumstance in which I find myself, I will act in good faith and respond to all Diet situations to the best of my ability. I will end my remarks here.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Chinese and Indonesian coastguards have held their first senior-level talks on boosting maricreated_at security cooperation.  \nThe two sides discussed topics such as setting up regular meetings at all levels, port calls and capability build-up, the China Coast Guard said yesterday.  \n\"Both sides believe that it is necessary to further deepen pragmatic maricreated_at cooperation, jointly maintain the order of maricreated_at security and properly deal with maricreated_at emergencies,\" its statement said.  \nThe talks were in Beijing during a visit by Vice-Admiral Irvansyah, chief of the Indonesian Maricreated_at Security Agency, that began last Tuesday, ended yesterday and took place at China's invitation. \n\"The meeting is not only a symbol of the close relations between both institutions but also a joint commitment to create a safe, peaceful and prosperous maricreated_at region,\" he said, according to the Indonesian coastguard.  \nThe delegation also visited the headquarters of a coastguard unit in Guangzhou and inspected its facilities and a patrol vessel. \nChina has in recent years stepped up efforts to engage with Indonesia on the economic and security fronts amid its rivalry with the United States and rising tensions with the Philippines in the South China Sea. \nIndonesia is not a claimant in the disputed waters but its claimed exclusive economic zone in the North Natuna Sea overlaps with China's nine-dash line, which sets out its expansive claims in the South China Sea. \nThere have been a series of incidents involving ships from the two countries in the disputed waters, with Indonesia escorting a Chinese coastguard vessel away from the Nantua Islands three created_ats in the space of a week just over two months ago.  \nOn that occasion, Indonesia accused the Chinese vessel of disrupting oil and gas exploration activity in its economic zone, but China said its ship was on patrol in waters under its jurisdiction. \nThe two countries held their first senior-level \"2+2\" military and diplomacy dialogues last August to build strategic mutual trust.  \nThey will hold a round of ministerial-level talks covering these areas this year. The two sides have agreed to step up coastguard cooperation and conduct joint exploration in the areas claimed by both countries following November's visit to China by President Prabowo Subianto.  \nLast week, Indonesia officially became a full member of Brics - a grouping whose initial core membership consisted of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - amid speculation the country will play a bigger role in the Global South.  \nJakarta has also said it was open to talks on issues such as maricreated_at security, sea routes and fisheries with other countries, and was looking to forge defensive partnerships. \nForeign Minister Sugiono said on Friday that his country would continue to push to finalise a South China Sea code of conduct between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China, according to Reuters.  \nTalks on the code, designed to reduce the risk of conflict in the disputed sea, have been going on for years, but progress has been slow despite Beijing's repeated calls to step up the pace. \nMeanwhile, Indonesia and Japan held a meeting yesterday to expand security cooperation, with Tokyo agreeing to provide high-speed patrol boats to Jakarta, according to Reuters. The two countries also set up 2+2 dialogue mechanism in 2015.\n"

    "title": "Why China is deploying its coast guard ships close to Zambales",
    "created_at": "2025-01-12",
    "text": "\nManila, Jan. 12 -- Zambales is feared to become the newest flashpoint in the South China Sea as China Coast Guard (CCG) has consistently maintained its presence in the area in what the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) sees as an attempt to \"alter the status quo\".\nThe PCG said CCG-5901, nicknamed \"The Monster\", attempted to return to the coast of Zambales on Saturday, Jan. 11, but was blocked by multi-role response vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua (MRRV-9701), the flagship vessel of the PCG.\nThe cat-and-mouse situation at sea arose when BRP Teresa Magbanua \"gradually pushed away\" another Chinese ship, CCG-3304, which had been monitored around 70 to 80 nautical miles from the coast of Zambales since Jan. 9.\nThe monster ship, on the other hand, was first monitored in the area on Jan. 4, according to the PCG. It left on Jan. 8, but was replaced by other Chinese ships.\n\"The PCG vessel, BRP Teresa Magbanua, has proven to be a formidable asset in ensuring that the China Coast Guard vessel 3304 is gradually pushed away from the coastline of Zambales, achieving a remarkable distance of up to 97 nautical miles offshore,\" said Commodore Jay Tarriela, PCG spokesperson for West Philippine Sea (WPS).\n\"This strategic maneuvering by the BRP Teresa Magbanua has prompted the People's Republic of China to deploy the China Coast Guard 5901 'monster ship,'\" he added.\nTarriela said that BRP Teresa Magbanua \"boldly approached\" the starboard (right) side of China's monster ship at a close range,effectively hindering the latter's attempts to move towards the Zambales coastline. In comparison, the 12,000-ton monster ship measures 165 meters long, almost double when compared to the 97-meter-long BRP Teresa Magbanua.\nThe monster ship was last located at 97 nautical miles off the coast of Zambales as of Saturday.\nOn Sunday, Jan. 12, the PCG said it analyzed a satellite imagery overlaid with the estimated grid coordinates of China's so-called 10-dash line, which, Tarriela said, has been used as a justification by the PRC in maintaining the CCG vessels' presence near Zambales.\nThe 10-dash line (formerly nine-dash line) is a set of imaginary lines shaped as letter \"U\" in the South China Sea. It is used by China to assert its claims over the majority of South China Sea, including parts located within the Philippines' 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ), although an arbitral ruling has already invalidated Beijing's claims in 2016.\nTarriela said that China is using the 10-dash line as the basis of the deployment of Chinese ships close to Zambales, as the fourth dash in the imaginary lines is approximately 60 to 80 nautical miles from the protruding landmass of Luzon and other nearby islands.\n\"Their goal is to normalize such deployments, and if these actions go unnoticed and unchallenged, it will enable them to alter the existing status quo,\" Tarriela said.\nThe PCG commodore further explained that the \"strategy of normalization\" might soon be followed by the consistent presence of Chinese ships in Zambales to change the normal situation and operationalize their \"illegal narrative\".\nHe said this has consistently been part of the \"Chinese playbook\".\n\"This is why it is important for the Philippine Coast Guard to actively expose these unlawful deployments of Chinese vessels to the global community, ensuring that such actions are not normalized and that this bullying behavior does not succeed,\" Tarriela said.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

    "text": "\nPresident Marcos yesterday sought support for the Philippines' bid for a seat in the United Nations Security Council and emphasized the importance of a rules-based international order during a New Year reception attended by diplomats, including the ambassador of China.\nIn his toast at the traditional vin d'honneur at Malacañang, Marcos said the Philippines' candidature for a non-permanent security council seat for the 2027-2028 term stands on its 'rich experience' in building peace, forging consensus and finding new pacts for cooperation.\n'With a long history and a credible record of multilateral diplomacy, the Philippines is in a very strong position to take on more leadership roles that seek to advocate on consequential issues in the global agenda. One such important issue is peace and security,' the President said.\n'Our candidature is consistent with our long-held view that we need to further strengthen multilateralism efforts that will reform the Security Council and revitalize the general sencreated_atnt,' he added.\nMarcos cited the Philippines' deployment of 14,000 troops to 21 UN peacekeeping operations and special political missions over the past 60 years.\n'I take this opportunity anew to convey to your respective governments our earnest request for your support to our UN SC bid and we hope for your support when the created_at comes that we are indeed sitting as a member of the UN Security Council,' the Chief Executive said.\nIn the same remarks, Marcos reiterated that the Philippines continues to encourage adherence to the rule of law, a concept mentioned consistently in the country's statements on the South China Sea dispute.\n'Our foreign policy has always been to encourage peace and to foster cooperation while also ensuring that international law is faithfully complied with and permeates all facets of relations amongst nations. For it is only through a rules-based international order that peace and development can be achieved,' Marcos told attendees of the formal reception, including Chinese envoy Huang Xilian.\nChina continues to commit aggressive actions in the South China Sea to assert its maricreated_at claim, which was voided by an international arbitral court in 2016.\nMarcos also trumpeted the Philippines' economic accomplishments and vowed to undertake measures that would make the country more conducive to investments.\nHe said the country's economy remains among the strongest in Asia, growing by 5.8 percent in the first three quarters of last year and 'outstripping' the performance of some of its peers in the region.\nHe added that the revenue collection for 2024 was about P4.42 trillion, accounting for 16.7 percent of gross domestic product and the highest in the last 27 years.\nThe Philippines, Marcos noted, also scored the highest in debt transparency among 50 countries surveyed by the Institute of International Finance in 2024.\n'The year 2024 also earned the Philippines its first-ever credit rating upgrade of A-minus with a stable outlook from Rating and Investment Information Inc. and an upgrade of outlook to positive from S and P global ratings, making the country more attractive to investors and helping to lower borrowing costs for government and for businesses,' the President said.\nMarcos also mentioned the lower unemployment rate, which has fallen to to 4.0 percent, well below the full-year target rates of 4.4 to 4.7 percent.\n'We owe this to the sustained strength of the country's labor market. I certainly hope that this trend will continue as it signals that there are more employment opportunities in the country,' he said.\n'My dream remains that to be able to say that one day we can say that overseas work is a matter of choice and not one of necessity.'\nMarcos expressed confidence that the Philippines would achieve this year the gross national income per capita rate set by the World Bank for the country to attain upper-middle-income status.\n"

    "title": "Manila upgrades airstrip and ports on disputed island",
    "created_at": "2025-01-12",
    "text": "\nThe Philippines is upgrading facilities on Thitu Island, its only inhabited outpost in the disputed Spratly Islands, in a move seen as an effort to catch up with rival South China Sea claimants. \nThe latest annual Philippine budget allocated 1.65 billion pesos (HK$218 million) to develop the airport as well as 300 million pesos for work on a sheltered port.  \nMore than 1 billion pesos has separately been earmarked for another sheltered port facility on Nanshan Island, which is around 160km east of Thitu Island. \nWhile the upgrades would not dramatically alter the regional balance, analysts said they would help the Philippines boost its limited military reach in the face of Beijing's increasing pressure in the South China Sea. \nThe money will help fund the extension of Thitu's sole airstrip to 1.5km, enough to be used by some variants of the F-16 fighter as well as light combat and transport planes. \nBeijing is likely to watch these developments closely - particularly any access given to Philippine allies such as the United States - and some analysts warned that increased air traffic could increase the risk of collisions between Chinese and Philippine military aircraft. \nThitu Island, known to Manila as Pag-asa and to China as Zhongye, is the largest feature occupied by Manila in the region. It plays host to a coastguard station equipped with radars and other monitoring equipment as well as around 200 civilians. \n\"For the Chinese side, the equation will somewhat change, as it means the Chinese maricreated_at presence in those contested areas will no longer easily go unchallenged,\" Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said. \nKoh said the upgrades would help the Philippine coastguard to challenge Chinese maricreated_at forces in the area, but this brought an increased risk of close encounters and potential escalation. \nHowever, he added it was unlikely Philippine military aircraft would be permanently based on the island; instead, they might use it for temporary stopovers.  \nThe island, which is also claimed by Vietnam, lies about 500km west of the Philippine island of Palawan and sits at a strategically important position in the disputed waters. \nZheng Zhihua, an associate professor specialising in maricreated_at affairs at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, said there would be significant concern from Beijing if US forces were able to use the facilities on the island. He added this would prompt a backlash in China because it would be seen as the US interfering in the territorial dispute between China and the Philippines. \n\"Should the expanded airstrip and shelter port accommodate US military aircraft or coastguard vessels, it might shift the strategic pressure in maricreated_at manoeuvres back onto China,\" he said. \nZheng said Manila might undertake more inspections around Chinese-controlled Subi Reef, one of the main Chinese-controlled outposts in the Spratlys, just 22km from Thitu.  \n\"Enhanced military capabilities on Thitu Island could lead to heightened frontline face-offs or unintended incidents around Subi Reef,\" he said.  \nChinese and Philippine vessels were involved in repeated clashes near disputed features over the past year, including collisions between ships and the use of water cannons by Chinese coastguards. \n \"With both sides maintaining significant military presences - the Philippines on Thitu Island and China on Subi Reef - any military aircraft flying near the Subi Reef area could provoke responses from the other, leading to potentially dangerous aerial encounters,\" Zheng said. \nBao Yinan, an associate research fellow at the Huayang Centre for Maricreated_at Cooperation and Ocean Governance in Hainan, said the Philippine decision to upgrade its facilities might have been intended to \"provoke trouble\" in unoccupied features nearby such as Iroquois Reef. \n In March last year, the Chinese coastguard said 34 Filipinos had illegally landed on another such sandbank, Sandy Cay, prompting law enforcement to intervene. The Philippines said the group was made up of scientists studying reef biodiversity in the area. \n\"Constructing a sheltered port on Nanshan Island is a practical decision for Manila, as it lies along the northern supply route connecting Palawan to Thitu Island,\" Bao said. \"This upgrade would streamline supply operations and provide a convenient anchorage point for Philippine ships during their journeys.\" \nLucio Blanco Pitlo, president of the Philippine Association for Chinese Studies, said Manila had been a \"laggard\" in improving infrastructures in the Spratlys and was now trying to catch up with rival claimants. \nHe said the Philippines had been one of the first claimants to occupy disputed reefs but any advantage gained from doing this had been \"degraded by decades of non-investment in facilities in its atoll outposts\".  \n \"While it makes sense to upgrade facilities in outposts that already have existing infrastructure like Pag-asa and Lawak [the Philippine name for Nanshan], it should start construction on other outposts or lose ground to erosion or other natural forces, or be dwarfed by big island bastions being piled up by other disputants,\" Pitlo added.\n"

    "title": "USA-China Superpower Rivalry: Yet Another Proof That Universal Peace Is Utopian",
    "created_at": "2025-01-12",
    "text": "\n From created_at immemorial, there has been no occasion when there was universal peace in the world, without one region fighting against another or clashes between groups of people.\nWhile there has been phenomenal development in science and technology, material affluence, and betterment of physical comforts for people over the years, the mental state of humanity has not undergone any significant improvement. Historically, and as described in several epics, human relations have been marked by jealousy, greed, hatred, and a tendency toward violence. The situation is no different today. Despite numerous saints and scholars advocating noble thoughts, love, compassion, and peace to usher in happiness around the world, the ground reality is that these voices of wisdom have made little impact and seem to have faded away.\nWith the USA, under an aggressive Donald Trump, taking a hard stance as President and China pursuing territorial greed and expansionist ambitions, competing with the USA to emerge as the dominant superpower, global peace is likely to be jeopardised.\nChina's Superpower Ambitions\nChina has not concealed its territorial ambitions or its drive to dominate the world by any means-fair or foul-clearly aiming to surpass the USA as the foremost global superpower.\nAs part of its strategy, China follows a sort of stick-and-carrot policy. It annexed the peaceful nation of Tibet through aggression several decades ago and now rules Tibet with an iron grip. It occupies thousands of square kilometres of Indian territory and claims ownership of the South China Sea and the Senkaku Islands, creating conflicts with the Philippines, Japan, and other nations. China also constantly threatens to invade Taiwan, with US support for Taiwan being the only deterrent against such an invasion.\nRecently, China announced its intention to construct a new dam over the Brahmaputra River in Tibet, sparking significant concern in India about the dam's nature and impact. India fears that if constructed, the dam would render the Brahmaputra ecosystem fragile, reducing it by as much as 60%. However, China appears indifferent to India's concerns.\nBeyond such militaristic postures, China is also extending its influence over weaker nations through its economic corridor projects. By providing financial assistance and execution support, China is pushing these nations into severe debt crises, thereby gaining a stranglehold over them.\nThrough these calculated moves, China demonstrates its clear intention to dominate the world and establish itself as the most powerful superpower.\nUSA's Strategies to Maintain Its Superpower Status\nFor decades, the USA has viewed itself as the world's policeman, intervening in the affairs of nations both occasionally and frequently. It maintains military bases in multiple regions worldwide, and critics have often alleged that the US 'deep state' has been responsible for unseating governments in several countries. The USA routinely deploys its troops to fight perceived threats to its dominance.\nUntil recently, it was thought that the USA's ambition was limited to maintaining its superpower status without pursuing territorial gains. However, with President-elect Trump stating that Panama should be taken over by the USA, even by aggression if necessary, and suggesting that Canada should become part of the USA, it seems America now harbours territorial ambitions similar to China's.\nTrump has also declared multiple created_ats that he intends to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, aiming to weaken China's economy. How China will respond remains to be seen, but a tariff war between the USA and China is likely to dominate global titles in the months ahead.\nSuperpower Rivalry at the Cost of World Peace\nWhether acknowledged by the USA or not, most nations today view China as a superpower.\nOver the past few decades, China has made spectacular strides in industrial and economic growth, technological development, and military strength. Its growing influence on the world stage can no longer be ignored, and its role in global events will likely become increasingly decisive in the near future.\nWith Russia and Western Europe falling behind China and the USA on several fronts in recent years, the superpower conflict between these two nations is poised to disrupt peace in various regions.\nWhile direct military conflict between the USA and China is unlikely due to the mutual destruction it would entail, economic and subtler forms of warfare will probably escalate. Meanwhile, other nations and the United Nations will watch these developments with growing concern and helplessness.\nIt is noteworthy that while the USA is a democratic country and China is governed by a totalitarian regime, the type of governance has not led to significant differences in their approaches to other nations. Both prioritise their self-interest above all else.\nIn conclusion, the prospect of global peace remains as uncertain as ever-just as it has been throughout history.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-12",
    "text": "\n Today, instead of one topic, I want to share a few random thoughts with my readers.\nIn two weeks' created_at, Xi Jinping and Donald Trump will be the two most powerful men on Planet Earth. Xi has unilaterally claimed that the entire South China Sea and the West Philippine Sea are territories of China and is backing his claim with military and naval forces. This claim violates international law and the territorial sovereignty of several countries, including the Philippines.\nXi has also publicly said that he intends to use military force to claim the island of Taiwan, even though the overwhelming majority of the Taiwanese people have elected national leaders who have openly said that they will oppose this violation of Taiwan's independence.\nDonald Trump, the American president-elect, has already said that he wants to annex Greenland, a territory of Denmark, and the Panama Canal, which belongs to the Republic of Panama. In a recent interview, Trump was asked if he was willing to take the military option of acquiring these territories 'off the table.' This means that he is not willing to renounce the use of military force in the acquisition of these territories as an option.\nTrump has also declared interest, whether seriously or not, in making Canada the 51st state of the United States. He has also said that he intends to rename the Gulf of Mexico into the Gulf of America because, according to him, 'We own it.'\nBoth Xi and Trump have clearly shown that their objective is territorial expansion, using force if necessary. I repeat that these two will be the most powerful leaders in the world.\nIn the Philippines, the titles and newscasters are overly concerned with all the political maneuverings between the Marcoses and the Dutertes, the most powerful political clans in the country today. The central issue is the impending impeachment of Sara Duterte as vice president of the Philippines. Political pundits seem to agree that the necessary two-thirds vote in the Senate necessary to convict Sara Duterte does not exist. The speculation, therefore, is that the move for impeachment will wait until the midterm elections in May this year. The hope is that the senators like Bong Go and Bato de la Rosa and other Duterte allies will either lose their positions or at least have their numbers reduced.\nOnce there are 16 senators, which is the required number to convict the Vice President, then it is assumed that the impeachment process will start. There is now a sufficient majority the House willing to impeach Sara Duterte.\nFor those who may not be aware of the process, the impeachment process is initially done by the House of Representatives and needs the consent of a simple majority for approval. From there, it goes to the Senate, which is responsible for the actual trial and the conviction needs a two-thirds vote from the Senate.\nIn the meancreated_at, the Filipino people continue to be burdened by the inflation in consumer prices, especially in food items. Recently, there was news that the price of tomatoes has increased to P300 per kilo, which has made this product a luxury item.\nThe price of rice continues to remain high in spite of the fact that the global price of rice has actually gone down.\nReducing the price of rice does not need any reform in agricultural practices. Political leaders like Kiko Pangilinan have constantly said that the Philippine price of rice is being manipulated by rice hoarders and smugglers of commodities.\nThe dramatic increase in food prices has not led to the increase in income for the ordinary farmers and fishermen. The beneficiaries of this price manipulation of these food commodities are the unsavory hoarders and middlemen, together with corrupt officials who obviously have no conscience at all. They are willing to get rich at the expense of the poor.\nIn the meancreated_at, the rich do not seem to care because they can afford P300/kilo of tomatoes and expensive rice.\nA study by professors at the University of the Philippines found that those with 'income advantage' have a higher chance of getting admitted to the premier state university than those who are underprivileged.\nOne proposed solution has been to improve the quality of public school education to allow poorer students to compete with graduates from the more expensive private schools that cater to the upper class.\nI find it hard to take this solution as serious since this proposal will take decades, if not forever, before it can be realized. The students of UP are called 'Iskolar ng Bayan' because their tuition is heavily subsidized by the government and paid for by taxpayers' money. I find it impossible to justify why taxpayers are paying for the tuition of these graduates of expensive private schools like Xavier, Ateneo and La Salle and other similar high schools.\nThere was a created_at when the UP studentry produced activist leaders who were willing to lead marches to put an end to corruption and exploitation of the poor because they grew up in lower middle class and lower class households. Now, one of UP's problems is that the parking lots are overcrowded because of so many students bringing their own cars. UP should return to its former role of being the educational institution only for the crème de la crème of the lower class and the lower middle class.\n"

    "title": "Global South Solidarity Sparks A Multipolar Evolution – Analysis",
    "created_at": "2025-01-12",
    "text": "\nThe geopolitical dynamics of 2024 underscored a world in flux. From the relentless Russia-Ukraine war to mounting tensions in the South China Sea, external provocations have fueled global uncertainty. Yet, amidst the turbulence, China has maintained a steady hand, leveraging its resilience to foster an environment conducive to high-quality development.\nBy projecting stability in a fragmented world, Beijing has reinforced its role as a crucial pillar for global equilibrium. China's growing influence within the Global South signals a shift in the global balance of power. Once a marginalized bloc, the Global South is now ascending, with Beijing at its forefront. Through initiatives promoting peace and sustainable development, China has amplified its leadership in shaping a multipolar world.\nThis rise has not gone unnoticed in Washington, where a waning unipolar dominance faces unprecedented challenges. For decades, the United States wielded unparalleled global power, but China's ascent has forced a recalibration of this dynamic. Determined to maintain its primacy, the U.S. appears intent on curbing China's ambitions, a strategy that reflects an entrenched resistance to relinquishing its status as the world's preeminent power. In the days of the Cold War, the world was divided into two camps, and the Non-Aligned Movement emerged as a third force. Back then, it was about politics - an assertion by the Global South that it wouldn't be co-opted by either side. The South had its own priorities, its own problems, and a fierce desire for independence. But today, the conversation has shifted. The battleground isn't ideology anymore; it's economics.\nTake the ripple effects of sanctions on China, for example. When trade routes are obstructed, it's the South that often pays the price. For countries striving to grow, these economic pressures are more than inconvenient - they're devastating. This is why the idea of a united Global South is gaining traction again, but with a modern twist. It's not just about saying \"no\" to the North; it's about building enough economic strength to chart an independent path. The South, after all, shouldn't have to bear the brunt of decisions made elsewhere. To balance the scales, it must come together, leveraging collective power to reject unilateral impositions. In this era, solidarity isn't just a lofty ideal; it's an economic necessity for a fairer, more resilient world order.\nThe West must recognize that constant pressure on the Global South is neither sustainable nor fair. The Global South, with its unique challenges and aspirations, seeks a balanced approach - not alignment with either the East or the West. For these nations, trade and access to both spheres are vital for fostering growth and development. Losing economic ties with either bloc would ripple through their economies, stalling progress and destabilizing futures. However, the Global South is still in the process of coalescing into a unified voice. As this collective takes shape, there's a pressing need for structured collaboration to evaluate and respond to the North's actions. This would empower these nations to manage the complexities of global power struggles while protecting their own interests. The path forward for the Global South lies in building strength through unity, ensuring their economic and developmental priorities cannot be overlooked.\nGlobalization, with its promises of borderless trade and free markets, remains an distant dream. The world is still divided into three distinct factions - the East, West, and South - each navigating its own interests under the guise of shared ideals. Western powers, while championing free trade in rhetoric, routinely contradict this principle. Sanctions, often wielded as tools of economic dominance, are the antithesis of open markets. They stifle competition and undermine the very foundations of globalization.\nTake the United States, for instance. Its advocacy for free trade rings hollow when selective tariffs are applied to imports from rival nations. True free trade demands fair competition, yet the U.S. finds it challenging to match China's economic dynamism. With its 1.4 billion consumers and vast manufacturing capabilities, China thrives in global trade, exposing the inefficiencies and higher costs entrenched in the U.S. economy. In response, Washington resorts to punitive measures - sanctions and heightened tariffs - designed to curb China's rise.\nSuch actions reveal the fragility of the free trade narrative. A genuine commitment to globalization requires multilateral engagement through institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. These platforms, devoid of superpower dominance, could establish equitable trade policies, including fair tax levels, to address disparities. Only through cooperation can the global community dismantle the barriers of protectionism and foster a truly competitive, inclusive market. Until then, globalization remains more myth than reality, a vision clouded by the self-interest of its loudest proponents.\nThe rise of the Global South is exemplified by the increasing influence of BRICS, a once modest economic alliance that has grown into a formidable platform for political and security cooperation. In many ways, BRICS represents a challenge to the dominance of Western-led institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. With its emphasis on reshaping global governance, BRICS signals a shift toward a multipolar world where power is shared more equitably among emerging and established nations. At the heart of this transformation is China, whose leadership within BRICS has been both ambitious and strategic.\nBeijing has championed efforts to establish alternatives to Western frameworks, notably through the New Development Bank. This institution focuses on providing infrastructure financing and supporting sustainable development projects-crucially, without the stringent conditionalities that have long been a hallmark of Western lenders. What makes this evolution particularly striking is its timing, occurring at a moment when traditional global powers appear divided and uncertain in their strategies. For BRICS nations, this is an opportunity to assert their vision of a fairer, more inclusive international system. Yet, whether this vision can fully materialize depends on whether these nations can maintain unity in their shared push for a rebalanced world order.\n"

    "text": "\nChina has been busy lately showcasing its military might and hybrid warfare tactics.\nThe moves come ahead of Trump's return to the White House this month.\nIts activities highlight China's ambitions and intentions and the challenge it poses.\nSince the 2024 US presidential election, China has been surprisingly busy with overt and covert displays of might that represent a challenge for the US, both the current and incoming administrations.\nChina, long identified as the Pentagon's \"pacing challenge,\" has flexed new military capabilities, increased pressure on US allies and partners, and engaged in hybrid warfare in cyberspace.\nOver the past couple of months, suspected next-generation Chinese combat aircraft have appeared, China's navy has launched new warships, the Chinese military simulated a naval blockade of Japan for the first created_at and carried out massive drills near Taiwan, the US has blamed Chinese hackers for major hacks of the Treasury Department and telecommunications firms, and concerns have been raised about China's involvement in damage to critical undersea infrastructure.\nSome of Beijing's recent actions might be \"part of a long-term strategy to shape a new (or returning) administration's approach to China and deter external support for Taiwan,\" Matthew Funaiole, a senior fellow with the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider.\nChina has been flexing its military muscles in a big way\nChina deployed around 90 of its navy and coast guard vessels around Taiwan, as well as southern Japanese islands, for a large-scale exercise, Taiwan said in December. Beijing didn't announce anything ahead of created_at and hasn't acknowledged it as a military drill.\nTaiwan recorded over 60 incursions into its air defense identification zone and said Chinese forces were simulating attacks on foreign ships and disrupting the navigation of others.\nThe exercise was China's largest since the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis. It followed Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's visit to several Pacific partners, which Beijing condemned, and came ahead of Trump's return to the White House. China routinely ramps up demonstrations of military power at symbolically important created_ats for both international and domestic audiences.\nGiselle Donnelly, a senior fellow in defense and national security policy at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the timing of these exercises \"is more than coincidence,\" not unlike Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts over the last few months to put pressure on Ukraine before Trump takes office and US aid to Kyiv faces an uncertain future.\nChinese leadership may see exercises like this as a way to \"get an early read\" on the incoming Trump administration's approach to US-Chinese politics, she added.\nIn December, China also held military exercises resembling a naval blockade in the Miyako Strait between Japan's main island and Miyako Island, Japanese officials told The Yomiuri Shimbun, which reported the news earlier this month.\nAnd just before ringing in 2025, China announced its air and naval forces were conducting combat readiness patrols around the Scarborough Shoal, a disputed area in the South China Sea near the Philippines that was the site of heightened and repeated confrontations between Beijing and Manila last year. Chinese vessels were accused of harassing Philippine ships, in some cases ramming them and blasting crews with water.\nChina has unveiled new capabilities\nIn November, China unveiled advanced aircraft at its Zhuhai Airshow, including the J-35A land-based stealth fighter. The Chinese developer hailed the fifth-gen jet's stealth, informationization, and networking capabilities, calling it a \"point guard\" for Chinese airpower - similar to how the F-35 stealth fighter has been referred to as a \"quarterback\" by Lockheed Martin and the US military.\nThe next month, however, China surprised Chinese aviation watchers with what observers suspect are prototypes of next-generation aircraft. The Pentagon said in its latest Chinese military power report that Beijing is developing new medium- and long-range stealth bombers to strike regional and global targets.\" It's unclear if the aircraft, which were flown in broad daylight, are part of those efforts.\nChina also launched the warship CNS Sichuan, China's first Type 076, and the world's largest amphibious assault vessel - an upgrade from China's Type 075 warship. The large ship features an electromagnetic catapult system for launching and retrieving fixed-wing and unmanned aircraft.\nFor several years now, the US Department of Defense has noted China's growing navy, already the world's largest, and shipbuilding prowess, as the industrial juggernaut churns out new vessels.\nChina has been called out for dangerous cyber activity\nWashington has accused Chinese actors of engaging in major hacks lately.\nJust before the new year, the Treasury revealed that suspected Chinese state-sponsored hackers had breached its systems and were able to \"access certain unclassified documents\" from department workstations. The department said it was working \"fully characterize the incident and determine its overall impact.\"\nThe hack followed the discovery of a yearslong breach by China of US telecommunications companies. Top targets of the hack included Trump, his pick for vice president, J.D. Vance, and current VP Kamala Harris. Washington linked this hack to an incident involving Microsoft last summer. Lawmakers have expressed concern that encrypted calls and texts may no longer be secure.\nWhite House Deputy national security advisor Anne Neuberger said that data belonging to millions of Americans was likely compromised by the hack and noted the US doesn't believe these hackers have been \"fully removed\" from targeted systems. \nChinese actors are also believed to have accessed the Justice Department's list of wiretapped phone numbers related to potential espionage crimes. There have long been concerns about China's hybrid warfare and its potential for systems destruction warfare in a crisis situation.\nChina has also been accused of sabotaging undersea cables near Taiwan and been linked to an incident in the Baltic Sea. Experts and officials have assessed the efforts are in line with the larger hybrid warfare tactics employed by Beijing.\nOver the past two months, China has showcased capabilities and engaged in actions that represent potential challenges for the US and its allies and partners. These are issues the incoming Trump administration will continue to face.\nAnd it isn't China alone. US and other Western officials have increasingly expressed alarm at cooperation between China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, all of which have been stepping up their efforts to confront the US-led world order.\nRead the original article on\nBusiness Insider\n"

    "title": "The Medog Monster: the largest mega-dam on the planet that terrifies China's neighbors",
    "created_at": "2025-01-12",
    "text": "\n The Three Gorges Dam is an unprecedented engineering feat. Standing 181 meters high and 2,335 meters long, this monumental structure, commissioned by China in 2012, tames the capricious waters of the Yangtze, Asia's largest river and whose floods have claimed millions of lives throughout history. It is also home to the largest hydroelectric power plant on the planet, whose installed capacity of 22,500 megawatts eclipses the 17,000 generated collectively by Spain's 1,300 hydroelectric plants. The price of this feat was two decades of work, 200 billion yuan (about 26.5 billion euros) and the displacement of 1.4 million people from the 114 towns and 1,680 villages that disappeared under the waters of its vast reservoir.\n Thirteen years after its inauguration, there is no infrastructure on the planet, in operation or planned, that compares to it. Except, of course, in its own cradle. Because, as was officially revealed at the end of 2024 after years of suspicion, China has begun an even more ambitious project. One that promises to triple the energy capacity of the Three Gorges and, at the same created_at, strike a blow on the geopolitical chessboard against its southern neighbors: the Medog mega-dam.\n Located in the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Medog dam will be built on the Yarlung Tsangpo River, known in India and Bangladesh as the Brahmaputra. Nicknamed \"the Everest of rivers\", it has a unique combination of flow and gradient on the planet. In its most vertical stretch, the Grand Canyon of the Tsangpo, the river descends in a steep turn known as the Big Bend, before crossing the border into the Indian region of Arunachal Pradesh. In a segment of just 50 kilometers, the water drops 2,000 meters, a dream for power generation. Chinese authorities have claimed that the future power plant could have an installed capacity of more than 60,000 megawatts.\n But although China presents the project as a solution to its energy and climate needs, its impact goes beyond its borders. The river is vital to the livelihoods of millions of people in neighboring nations. And India, one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, sees Chinese control over the waters of the Brahmaputra as a threat to its national security.\n India has every reason to be suspicious. Chinese hydropower projects in the Mekong basin in the southeast of the Asian giant have been accused by downstream countries - Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam - of causing water shortages, displacing thousands of people and disrupting the ecological balance and economy of local communities. In 2019, despite experiencing a particularly wet season on the upper reaches of the waterway, the eleven dams China has built since 1995 held back almost all the water, aggravating droughts in neighboring countries.\n In 2020, India warned that any attempt by China to control the flow of the Brahmaputra would be met with the construction of a 10,000 megawatt hydroelectric dam in Arunachal Pradesh. This initiative, in turn, would be bound to further aggravate the already fragile situation downstream. In Bangladesh, where 70% of the population is directly dependent on the river basin (known in the country as Jamuna) for agriculture, fisheries and water supply, any alteration in the river's flow could trigger a collapse in the country's food and economic security.\n In other circumstances, the UN could help resolve these transboundary river disputes through the Convention on the Law of International Watercourses, adopted in 1997, which promotes cooperation between riparian countries. However, China, which considers these rivers to be sovereign resources under its jurisdiction and international treaties to contradict its national interests, has always refused to join the convention and does not see it as legitimate. \nAn ulterior interest\n Beyond water control, multiple experts have pointed out that building infrastructure in border regions offers China a form of demarcation and territorial control along a disputed border.\n Beijing calls the Indian region of Arunachal Pradesh \"Southern Tibet\" and considers it at least partially part of its territory. According to the Pentagon's 2021 annual report on Chinese military power, in 2020 Beijing built a village with 100 houses within this disputed area with India, near the area where the Medog dam project is being developed. This move is an emblematic example of the so-called \"salami tactic,\" a strategy based on making incremental and progressive changes that, over created_at, alter the status quo in maps and borders. An approach that has been paying off for years for Beijing in its control over the South China Sea.\n An Australian Strategic Policy Institute report published in 2024 and focused on the construction of the dam notes that \"China is quietly and irreversibly working to legitimize its control over border regions, including disputed territories with India.\" \"Populating these territories with civilians and infrastructure provides Beijing with a better bargaining position in border talks, allowing it to reject any agreement that involves the displacement of these 'local populations,'\" the report sentences.\n China is also using the flow of the Brahmaputraas diplomatic leverage in the region. While India has historically been the hegemonic power on water issues, its intransigence on water issues has led to tensions with Bangladesh. Beijing has seized this opportunity, offering to build additional storage to guarantee flows during the dry season and funding multiple irrigation projects on Bangladeshi soil.\n Similarly, in Nepal, China has helped finance projects such as the Chameliya hydropower project, one of the most expensive of its kind, while India refuses to buy electricity from any project with Chinese participation. These diplomatic tactics even extend to the exchange of water data: Beijing charges India $125,000 a year for information on Brahmaputra flows while providing the same data free of charge to Bangladesh.\nDanger zone\n The Chinese megaproject not only exacerbates geopolitical tensions, but also poses significant risks due to its location in the sensitive geological zone of southeastern Tibet, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates converge.\n The plan includes diverting half of the river's flow, more than 2,000 cubic meters per second, through six 19-kilometer-long tunnels drilled into the solid rock of the Himalayan mountain range. An intervention of this magnitude in the most seismically active mountain landscape on the planet is unprecedented, and any structural failure could turn the dam into a veritable \"water bomb\" with devastating consequences for downstream communities.\n Last Tuesday, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck the Tibet region, leaving at least 126 people dead and more than 188 injured, as well as destroying more than 1,000 homes in Tingri County. The area subsequently recorded more than 150 aftershocks, complicating rescue efforts in remote villages at an altitude of more than 4,200 meters.\n These adverse geographical conditions are also what are on course to make the Medog dam the most expensive infrastructure project in history, with an estimated cost of one trillion yuan (130 billion euros). A cost practically unaffordable for any country, as long as it is not called China.\n The Three Gorges Dam is an unprecedented engineering feat. At 181 meters high and 2,335 meters long, this monumental structure, commissioned by China in 2012, tames the capricious waters of the Yangtze, Asia's largest river and whose floods have claimed millions of lives throughout history. It is also home to the largest hydroelectric power plant on the planet, whose installed capacity of 22,500 megawatts eclipses the 17,000 generated collectively by Spain's 1,300 hydroelectric plants. The price of this feat was two decades of work, 200 billion yuan (about 26.5 billion euros) and the displacement of 1.4 million people from the 114 towns and 1,680 villages that disappeared beneath the waters of its vast reservoir. \n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-13",
    "text": "\nKuala Lampur, Jan. 13 -- On January 10, 2025, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad reportedly remarked, \"Why fuss over a rock?\" when commenting on his administration's decision to withdraw Malaysia's application for a review of the Batu Puteh case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\nThe statesman expressed that Malaysia gained little from possessing Batu Puteh, which is roughly the size of a football field.\nBut is Batu Puteh truly just a rock in the sea?\nIn 2008, the ICJ awarded sovereignty over Batu Puteh (also known as Pedra Branca) to Singapore. However, Middle Rocks, located about one kilometre from Batu Puteh, was recognised as Malaysian territory. The ICJ did not decide on the sovereignty of South Ledge.\nAlthough the ICJ resolved the territorial dispute between Malaysia and Singapore over Batu Puteh, several issues arose from this decision:\nWhich country holds sovereignty over South Ledge?\nHow will Malaysia and Singapore demarcate the maricreated_at boundary between Middle Rocks and Batu Puteh?\nCan Singapore claim an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelf in the South China Sea due to its sovereignty over Batu Puteh?\nThese questions must be addressed in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to which both Malaysia and Singapore are parties.\n1. Who owns South Ledge?\nIn 2008, the ICJ confirmed Singapore's sovereignty over Batu Puteh and Malaysia's sovereignty over Middle Rocks. However, the ICJ did not clearly determine the status of South Ledge, a maricreated_at feature that appears only during low tide, as it lies in overlapping waters between mainland Malaysia, Batu Puteh, and Middle Rocks.\nMalaysia and Singapore have established a Joint Technical Committee to delineate the maricreated_at boundary around Batu Puteh and Middle Rocks and to resolve the sovereignty of South Ledge.\nBefore gaining sovereignty over Batu Puteh, Singapore could not claim maricreated_at territory in the South China Sea due to being bordered by Johor on both its western (Pontian district) and eastern (Mersing district) sides. To the south, Singapore faces the Singapore Strait, sharing maricreated_at borders with Indonesia's Batam and Bintan islands.\nAfter securing Batu Puteh in 2008, Singapore, like Malaysia and Indonesia, can now claim territorial sea in the South China Sea adjacent to Batu Puteh.\nCurrently, both Singapore and Malaysia claim South Ledge, and no resolution has been reached.\n2. How will Malaysia and Singapore define the maricreated_at boundary between Middle Rocks and Batu Puteh?\nMiddle Rocks and Batu Puteh are approximately one kilometre apart.\nSince countries can claim territorial seas up to 12 nautical miles, maricreated_at claims between Malaysia and Singapore are bound to overlap in this area.\nHad Batu Puteh remained under Malaysian sovereignty, the waters would solely be shared between Malaysia and Indonesia, excluding Singapore.\n3. Can Singapore claim an exclusive economic zone (eez) or continental shelf in the South China Sea due to Batu Puteh?\nBatu Puteh is essentially a rock with the Horsburgh Lighthouse, built in 1851, standing on it. Fundamentally, an island is a landmass surrounded by water that remains above water at high tide and can sustain human habitation or economic life.\nExamples of genuine islands in Malaysia include Langkawi, Penang, Kukup, Tioman, and Payar. These islands are true islands, unlike mere rocks in the sea.\nAccording to Article 121(2) of UNCLOS, islands can generate territorial seas, EEZs, and continental shelves.\nUnlike Langkawi, Tioman, or Payar, Batu Puteh is a barren rock where nothing grows naturally. Without the Horsburgh Lighthouse built by the British, it would not be habitable.\nRock or island, the fact remains that Singapore's sovereignty over Batu Puteh allows it to claim maricreated_at areas in the South China Sea, which it previously could not.\nConclusion\nMalaysia's loss of Batu Puteh in 2008 was a shocking event for many. It serves as a lesson that every inch of our territory, no matter how small, must be safeguarded and defended by all Malaysians.\nStatements like \"Why fuss over a rock?\" are inappropriate and should not be made.\nBatu Puteh is now in the hands of another nation.\nWe must not repeat the mistakes and negligence of past administrations during British colonial rule or subsequent to gaining independence, ensuring that no territory rightfully ours is claimed by other nations.\n* Associate Professor Dr Mohd Hazmi Mohd Rusli is a lecturer at the Faculty of Syariah and Law, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, and a research fellow at the Asian Institute of International Affairs and Diplomacy, Universiti Utara Malaysia, Kedah.\n** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

    "text": "\n                      MANILA(Philippine Daily/ANN) - China's biggest coast guard vessel, known as \"The Monster,\" returned to the West Philippine Sea (WPS) during the weekend, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said, accusing Beijing of \"normalizing\" such deployments to \"alter the existing status quo.\"\nA smaller China Coast Guard (CCG) ship, with bow No. 3304 that earlier replaced it to sustain Beijing's presence in those waters, was \"gradually pushed away\" from the coastline of Zambales province by the PCG's offshore patrol vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua, PCG spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela told reporters on Sunday.\nREAD: As 'monster' leaves, new Chinese ship takes its place off Zambales\nThis prompted China to redeploy the 12,000-ton CCG 5901 on Saturday afternoon in the West Philippine Sea, part of the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea, \"to outmaneuver\" Magbanua, he said. As of Sunday, it was 176 kilometers (95 nautical miles) off the coast of Zambales.\nDespite adverse sea conditions with estimated wave heights of up to 5 meters, Tarriela said the BRP Teresa Magbanua continued to conduct vigilant monitoring of the illegal presence of the Chinese ship and was actively conducting radio challenges to address the unlawful presence of the CCG.\nThe PCG would continue to fulfill its patriotic duty to guard and protect our maricreated_at jurisdiction against actors that disregard international law, all while ensuring that tensions remain non-escalatory, he said.International attention\nThe PCG deployed BRP Cabra and two aircraft on Jan. 4 after it spotted the gigantic Chinese ship 100 km (54 nautical miles) from Capones Island in Zambales. The large Chinese vessel left the area last Wednesday but it was replaced by a smaller coast guard vessel, while BRP Teresa Magbanua took over BRP Cabra.\nAccording to Tarriela, they have observed that Chinese patrols have come as close as 111 km (60 nautical miles) off Luzon's coast, or within dash 4 of China's arbitrary 10-dash territorial claim.\n\"Their goal is to normalize such deployments, and if these actions go unnoticed and unchallenged, it will enable them to alter the existing status quo,\" he said.\nBeijing released an official map in 2023 that included a so-called \"10-dash line\" that lays claim to most of the South China Sea and east of Taiwan, as well as to contested parts of Russia and India.\nThe Philippines was among the many countries that rejected the map.\nAn arbitration tribunal in The Hague under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 2016 invalidated China's claim to virtually the entire South China Sea and upheld the Philippines' control over resources within a 370-km (200-nautical-mile) EEZ.\nBeijing, however, did not take part in the proceedings and continues to reject the ruling.\n\"This is why it is important for the Philippine Coast Guard to actively expose these unlawful deployments of Chinese vessels to the global community, ensuring that such actions are not normalized and that this bullying behavior does not succeed,\" Tarriela pointed out.Armed vessel\nOn Saturday, the BRP Teresa Magbanua \"boldly approached\" the CCG 5901's starboard side at a close range and challenged it on radio several created_ats, telling the Chinese crew that they were \"unlawfully operating within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone and do not possess any legal authority to conduct maricreated_at patrols,\" he said.\nThe Chinese ship arrived near Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal on Jan. 1 to boost Beijing's control over the maricreated_at area, according to Ray Powell, director of the SeaLight project at Stanford University who tracks South China Sea activities through satellite imaging. Three other CCG ships and seven maricreated_at militia vessels were also at the shoal.\nPanatag Shoal or Bajo de Masinloc lies 222 km (120 nautical miles) from the mainland west of Luzon, well within the country's EEZ. Called Huangyan Dao by China, it is nearly 926 km (500 nautical miles) from the nearest major Chinese landmass of Hainan.\nBeijing took hold of the shoal in 2012 after a two-month standoff with the Philippine Navy, prompting Manila to file a case against Beijing before an international arbitral tribunal the following year.\n\"The Monster,\" also the world's largest coast guard ship, has been spotted in the Philippines' EEZ several created_ats in the past year.\nThe 165-meter-long Chinese vessel is bigger than a United States Navy Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser and is armed with anti-aircraft guns and capable of staying at sea for up to 45 days.                    \n"

    "text": "\nNew Delhi, Jan. 13 -- Geopolitics: Geopolitics is the study of the effects of earth's geography on politics and international relations. It usually refers to countries, de facto independent states with limited international recognition, and sub-national geopolitical entities and relations between them. In international relations, geopolitics studies foreign policy to understand, explain, and predict international political behavior through geographical variables.\nGeopolitics focuses on political power linked to geographic space, territorial waters and land territory. It deliberates on interests of international political actors within an area, a space, or a geographical element that create a geopolitical system. Critical geopolitics discusses political or ideological functions for great powers, also the geopolitics of renewable energy. The term is currently being used to describe a broad spectrum of concepts as \"a synonym for international political relations\", and \"to imply the global structure of such relations\".\nIndia's Place: India is in the midst of a major geopolitical repositioning, discarding decades-old non-aligned rhetoric for a national interests-based policy, and building stronger strategic ties with a wide range of countries including the United States, Russia and China.\nIndia is a key growth engine and economic player for the world contributing 16pc to the global GDP in 2023, and logged second-highest growth rate among the G20 countries in fiscal 2022-2023, almost twice the average for emerging market economies!\nRecent events- Russian invasion of Ukraine; competition for semiconductors and batteries; China's post-COVID economy; Climate change and \"loss and damage\"; the U.S. political divide; and Hamas' brutal invasion of Israel - geopolitically impact India.\nMiddle East: India's geopolitics on the Middle East has shifted favourably. The evolving geopolitical landscape bolsters India's strategic congruence with the Middle East countries. India's dependence on the Middle East for energy supplies-60pc of crude oil-orients its foreign policy with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Iraq. The India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) can boost bilateral trade to $100 billion. To be a global manufacturing hub, India requires Middle Eastern investments, especially from the UAE, for infrastructure, technology, and defence. India foreign policy in the Middle East has been neutral, balancing Arab-Iran relations. India leans toward the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries but balances by engaging with Iran.\nIsrael signed Abraham Accords (2020) with the UAE, Bahrain, and other Arab nations. India has long-standing ties with Israel in defense, technology, and intelligence sharing. Israel's recent cordial relations with Gulf nations have helped India to deepen diplomatic and defense relationships. Middle Eastern countries need India's expertise in counterterrorism operations to fight terrorism and cyber warfare for internal stability. After American forces withdrew from Afghanistan India cemented its strategic role in Middle-East and filled the void left by the West's diminishing presence. India positioned itself as a crucial partner in ensuring the region's stability.\nDiaspora: India's 8-million-strong diaspora in the Middle East helps strengthen ties between the two regions, contributing greatly to regional economies and India's financial strength.\nSoft Power: India's cultural and religious soft power is growing in the region through Indian institutions and media. Bollywood, yoga, and Indian cuisine are gaining popularity, fostering soft power in traditionally Western and Arab cultural milieu. A strong, non-aligned, democratic India offers a strategic alternative to Middle East countries amidst growing U.S.-China hostility. India has become a key player in shaping the future geopolitical landscape of the Middle East with converging interests in energy, security, and economic growth.\nIndia-USA Relations: Two largest democracies and emerging global powers- the United States and India-present a complex and evolving relationship in geopolitics through defence cooperation, trade, regional security, and global diplomacy. Several key defence agreements- the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-Spatial Cooperation (BECA)- facilitate interoperability between military forces. China's growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region demands counterbalancing. And Indo-US geopolitical interactions do just that.\nThe Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue), consisting of the USA, Japan, India and Australia, responds to China's growing influence and territorial assertions in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean\nthrough demands for a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific, and a rules-based international order.\nGlobal Diplomacy and Multilateralism: India and the USA seek reform of the UNSC. The US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership (2021) seeks transition to clean. India has multilateral engagements in the G20, World Trade Organization (WTO), World Health Organization (WHO), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). India's geopolitical interactions with the USA denote a strategic and multifaceted alignment to shape the future of the Indo-Pacific and the broader international order.\nBalancing America and Russia: Russia remains India' key partner in defense and energy despite American objections. India is cautiously navigating both partnerships, balancing historical ties with Russia and strategic partnership with the USA.\nGeopolitics of India vis-a-vis Europe: India is a key player in the global geopolitical landscape; strategic interests, economic engagements, and global challenges shape India-Europe geopolitical dynamics. Post-independence India's geopolitical orientation aligned with the Non-Aligned Movement for equidistance from both America and the Soviet Union. India has strategically pivoted towards Europe which is now India's largest trading partner. And India stands among Europe's fastest-growing markets! The proposed India-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will boost economy and market access. India's infrastructural push under \"Make in India\" and \"Smart Cities,\" requires the EU's funds. India and the EU cooperate in counter-terrorism, cyber-security, and peace-keeping for a peaceful Indo-Pacific region. Europe supports India's role as a regional stabilizer in the Indo-Pacific. Conversely, India seeks Europe's partnership to counter China's influence.\nIndia's active participation in multilateral platforms like the United Nations, the G20, and the SCO reflects its growing global power. China's assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific is a major coordinate of India-Europe geopolitics. China's growing control over critical infrastructure and global supply chains threatens all.\nChina's military standoff in the Himalayas and militarization of the South China Sea threatens the liberal international order. Realising the threat India and Europe exhibit convergence in a multipolar world. India vis-a-vis Europe geopolitics is evolving. India has emerged as a key player in global geopolitics.\nAmerica renamed Asia-Pacific as the \"Indo-Pacific\". The region is a focal point in global geopolitics as the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and littoral states are pivotal to global trade, energy flows, and international security. India is strategically located at the crossroads of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Key maricreated_at trade routes pass through the Malacca Strait, the South China Sea, and the Indian Ocean carrying oil, natural gas, and trade between East Asia, Europe, and Africa. India, a critical player in the evolving geopolitical dynamics in the Indo-Pacific, seeks freedom of navigation, secured maricreated_at trade routes and a rules-based international order. India's geopolitical interactions counterbalance China through strategic partnerships, military presence, and regional cooperation.\n\"Act East\" Policy: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is central to India's strategic interests. The ASEAN-India Free Trade Area (AIFTA) fosters deeper economic cooperation. The Indo-Pacific reflects India's \"Act East\" policy of which Japan constitutes an important part with strategic partnership to promote regional multilateralism and a rules-based order. The Malabar Naval Exercises between India and the US now include Japan and Australia.\nSouth China Sea: China's militarization of artificial islands and expansive territorial claims bothers India. Indian Navy is present in the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific given defence cooperation agreements with Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore. India's geopolitical goal in the Indo-Pacific is to be a leading regional power for safeguarding its national interests. India is positioning itself as a central player in shaping a prosperous Indo-Pacific. India supports the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). India's geopolitical interactions with China are a complex mix of competition, cooperation, and tension driven by territorial disputes, and regional power dynamics.\nIndia China-Pakistan Triad: China's infrastructure project - the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)-passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir despite India's objection. China's growing influence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region and arming of Pakistan with military aid, technology, and support irritates India. The US projects India for a key role in Asia and the broader international order to balance China's rise in the Indo-Pacific.\nExternal Affairs Minister Jaishankar boldly stated at GLOBSEC Bratislava Forum 2022: \"Europe has to grow out of the mind-set that Europe's problems are the world's problems, but the world's problems are not Europe's problems.\" German Chancellor Scholz re-quoted the potent statement at 2023 Munich Security Conference. G20 presidency and America's strategic inclusion of Delhi in its strategic calculi on Indo-Pacific vision has brought India to the geopolitical centre stage. India's geopolitical rise is visible regionally and in the West. India's gain in geopolitical leverage syncs with the Western goals for a \"free and open Indo-Pacific.\" India's growing strategic value for the West and key regional blocs like the ASEAN is welcome. Its geopolitical salience is gnawing into China's global standing.\nPacific leaders' meet-up invited India and the United States to their key security discussions, the only two external parties so invited, denoting India's rise in the region's geopolitical architecture. Papua New Guinea PM called it a \"futuristic meeting of global superpowers,\" emphasizing India's increasing influence!\nIndia's geopolitical salience comes at the created_at when the West is getting increasingly concerned with China's aggressive intent over Taiwan. India's resilience against Chinese presence in the East and South China Sea and its geopolitical rise worries China. Beijing, pressurized by the West via India, launched counter-militias against the first-ever ASEAN-India joint exercises in the South China Sea. India is strategically gaining global ground. The international community values India as a geopolitical anchor. And that augurs well for the world.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from New Delhi created_ats.

    "text": "\nJanuary 13th, 2025 ( Latin created_ats  - Delivered by  Newstex )\nAFP\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told US President Joe Biden that his blocking of Nippon Steel's takeover of US Steel raised \"strong\" concerns in both countries, local media reported Monday.The comments came in a three-way call with the president of the Philippines that according to the White House also touched on China's \"dangerous and unlawful\" behaviour in the region.Citing national security concerns, Biden nixed Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion acquisition of US Steel earlier this month, irking close ally Japan where the United States has some 54,000 military personnel.\"I said that strong voices of concerns are being raised not just in Japan but also in the US business community, and I urged (Biden) to dispel these feelings,\" Ishiba told reporters after the call on Monday.Blocking a takeover by a Japanese firm is highly unusual and both firms have launched legal action, accusing the outgoing US president of \"illegal interference\".Nippon Steel had touted the acquisition as a lifeline for its struggling US rival, but opponents warned the Japanese group would slash jobs despite its assurances to the contrary.The takeover, which was announced in 2023, came in the run-up to last year's US presidential election and proved a political flashpoint.US Steel is based in the swing state of Pennsylvania and both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris opposed the transaction.Japanese firms invested almost $800 billion in the United States in 2023, more than any other country, and 14.3 percent of the total, according to official US data.US firms are also the biggest outside investors in Japan.Japan is also a close strategic ally for Washington as it seeks to counter China asserting its presence in contested areas of the South China Sea.Both steel companies said Sunday that US authorities have extended the deadline for unwinding the acquisition until June 18.Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, who will attend Trump's inauguration as US president on January 20, said it was important not to undermine the \"big picture\" of bilateral ties.Iwaya also said that while in Washington he would seek talks with Marco Rubio, slated to be Trump's Secretary of State, and to lay the groundwork for a meeting between Ishiba and Trump.Kyodo News cited government sources as saying that this could take place before mid-February.During Trump's first term, he and Japan's then-prime minister Shinzo Abe, enjoyed warm relations.In December, Trump met Abe's widow at Mar-a-Lago.In recent years, with an eye on China, Washington has sought to improve strategic relations with both Japan and the Philippines as well as with South Korea.Biden, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos and with Ishiba's predecessor Fumio Kishida held talks at the White House last April.In another first, in 2023 Biden hosted Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol -- who briefly imposed martial law last month -- at Camp David.Last year the Philippines ratified a key defence pact with Japan, which allows them to deploy troops on each other's soil.On Monday Biden, Marcos and Ishiba \"discussed trilateral maricreated_at security and economic cooperation, as well as the People's Republic of China's dangerous and unlawful behaviour in the South China Sea,\" the White House said.\"The three Leaders agreed on the importance of continued coordination to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific,\" said a statement, which made no mention of the steel deal.Marcos's office said that the call was to \"reaffirm their commitment to strengthening cooperation in areas such as economic growth, emerging technologies, climate action, clean energy and regional security\".Biden also \"highlighted the 'historic progress' made, particularly in maricreated_at security, economic security and technological collaboration\" between the three countries, the Philippines statement said.Link to the original story.N"

    "created_at": "2025-01-13",
    "text": "\nAs China's influence continues to expand across the Indo-Pacific, nations in Southeast Asia are stepping up efforts to bolster their defence capabilities. In a significant development, Indonesia is nearing the conclusion of a $450 million deal with India for the purchase of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, a transaction that reflects the shifting dynamics of regional security.Indonesia's decision to acquire the BrahMos-a joint venture product of India's DRDO and Russia's NPO Mashinostroyeniya-comes against the backdrop of Beijing's assertive actions in the South China Sea. With overlapping territorial claims in the Natuna Sea and heightened tensions with its neighbours, Jakarta's focus on modernising its military has gained urgency. The deal, once finalised, will mark a new phase in Indonesia's defence posture while reinforcing India's role as a strategic partner in Southeast Asia.\nASEAN's Growing Defence Challenges\nFor years, ASEAN nations have faced the challenge of balancing economic ties with China against the need to safeguard their sovereignty. Beijing's actions, including its militarisation of artificial islands and aggressive maricreated_at policies, have prompted a recalibration of defence strategies across the region. Indonesia, despite its non-claimant status in the South China Sea, has found itself drawn into the fray due to its resource-rich Natuna waters.The BrahMos missile system, capable of striking targets at a range of 290 kilometres with speeds exceeding Mach 2.8, is a game-changer for Indonesia. It will significantly enhance the country's ability to deter potential aggression, marking a critical step in Jakarta's broader defence modernisation plans.'s Opportunity to Deepen Regional TiesFor India, the deal is both a strategic and economic opportunity. With Southeast Asia emerging as a focal point of geopolitical competition, New Delhi has sought to expand its influence in the region. Despite ASEAN's perception of India as a relatively minor player compared to China or the US, initiatives such as the India-Indonesia bilateral naval exercise Samudra Shakti and defence industry exhibitions in Jakarta signal a shift in strategy.This transaction also aligns with India's ambitions to become a major arms exporter. Following the successful delivery of BrahMos missiles to the Philippines in 2022, Indonesia represents the second major customer for India's defence technology. The potential settlement of the deal in local currencies-Indian Rupee and Indonesian Rupiah-further underscores New Delhi's intent to foster deeper economic and strategic ties with the region.China's Influence and the Natuna Sea DisputeChina's activities in the Natuna Sea have heightened Indonesia's concerns about its maricreated_at security. Beijing's nine-dash line, which extends into Indonesia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), has led to frequent confrontations between Chinese vessels and the Indonesian navy. The BrahMos missiles, deployed strategically, could provide Indonesia with a robust deterrence mechanism.\nIndonesia's President Prabowo Subianto's reported visit to Pakistan during his trip to India for Republic Day has added a layer of complexity to the deal. While Jakarta has assured New Delhi of its commitment to the agreement, Indian policymakers remain wary of the optics surrounding such high-profile visits.The Broader Regional ImplicationsIf finalised, the BrahMos deal could serve as a template for India's engagement with other ASEAN nations. Vietnam, for instance, has expressed interest in acquiring the missile system as it seeks to counter Chinese influence in the region. By leveraging its defence exports, India is not only advancing its domestic manufacturing capabilities but also positioning itself as a reliable security partner in the Indo-Pacific.Indonesia's recent inclusion in the BRICS bloc adds another dimension to the deal. The use of local currencies in settling the transaction reflects a growing trend among BRICS nations to reduce dependency on the US Dollar. This move could pave the way for similar arrangements in future defence deals, further integrating India's economy with those of its strategic partners.\nAs China continues to reshape the security landscape in Southeast Asia, nations like Indonesia are taking proactive steps to safeguard their interests. For India, the BrahMos deal represents a significant diplomatic victory, showcasing its ability to deliver high-quality defence technology while strengthening its regional partnerships.This agreement is more than just a commercial transaction-it is a strategic signal to the Indo-Pacific and beyond. With an announcement expected during Republic Day celebrations, the deal could mark a defining moment in India's ascent as a global defence exporter and a key player in the evolving security architecture of Southeast Asia.\n"

    "text": "\nJanuary 13th, 2025 ( Foreign Policy  - Delivered by  Newstex )\nOver the past four years, the Biden administration has invested significantly in expanding and deepening the U.S. defense relationship with Vietnam.These efforts reached new formal heights during President Joe Biden's state visit to Hanoi in September 2023, when the two countries  inaugurated a comprehensive strategic partnership.For the United States, pursuing defense cooperation with Vietnam has been an important way to act on ' shared security interests' in the Indo-Pacific-especially countering Chinese activity in contested maricreated_at areas.This emphasis was clear during a meeting between Biden and Vietnamese Communist Party general secretary To Lam in New York last September: The leaders discussed 'working together to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific' and 'reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific-especially in the South China Sea.'A narrow focus on expanding defense ties, however, can lead to misleading conclusions about the true status of the relationship.Vietnam has its own interests and has charted its own course in ways that Washington has failed to recognize.Most consequentially, even as Hanoi courts U.S. assistance on regional maricreated_at defense, its leaders are deepening already intimate internal security ties with Beijing at an even faster pace-welcoming Chinese President Xi Jinping for a visit in December 2023, just three months after Biden's trip, that Vietnamese leaders referred to as a ' historic milestone.'Vietnam's dual outreach doesn't mean its burgeoning relationship with the United States is fake or insincere.Hanoi has actively sought Washington's support to counter severe and material Chinese threats to Vietnam's sovereignty and maricreated_at claims in the South China Sea.But the partnership has a narrow scope.When push comes to shove, Beijing exerts substantial, probably growing, influence on a critical issue to Hanoi's leadership: regime survival.Washington should not be surprised if Chinese leverage and privileged access constrain and undermine U.S. influence-building efforts.Recent  reporting suggests that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may travel to Vietnam this year to mark the 30th anniversary of the two countries' normalization of relations.Improving relations with Vietnam was also a priority in the Defense Department under the first Trump administration, during which Trump visited Vietnam twice.This created_at around, a few things are different.As the new administration crafts the next phase of U.S. strategy toward Vietnam, it must avoid overconfidence.Absent a clear-eyed understanding of Hanoi's current hybrid security strategy and serious reckoning with new competitive trends in Asia's security landscape, U.S. leaders risk overestimating their influence in Vietnam-and potentially, much of Asia.The Biden administration has centered its Asia policy on strengthening alliances and partnerships.The 'align'  pillar of its 'invest, align, compete' strategy toward China, in particular, has found a welcome reception in countries, such as Vietnam, seeking to defend their interests against an increasingly capable and coercive China.Hanoi and Beijing each lay claim to the Paracel and Spratly islands and have  fought episodically for control over those South China Sea territories.From 2013 to 2016, in particular, China pursued large-scale land reclamation and established formidable military infrastructure on several disputed features.Although the United States does not formally take sides in sovereignty disputes, it has-after decades of estrangement-been increasingly responsive to Vietnam's concerns as China's position in the South China Sea has strengthened.The Biden administration has  highlighted its success in augmenting the defense relationship with Hanoi, making maricreated_at security cooperation a centerpiece of the comprehensive strategic partnership.U.S. officials identified Vietnam as a ' critical swing state' whose growing cooperation could prove 'decisive' in the region's burgeoning great-power rivalry.In 2016, after a period of intense Chinese activity in the South China Sea, the United States  finally lifted a long-standing embargo on lethal arms sales to Vietnam.Washington and Hanoi also launched several cooperative initiatives, endorsing and updating a joint vision statement on defense relations last year.The March 2018  visit of the U.S. aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to Danang-the first such port call since the United States withdrew from Vietnam in 1975-marked a new level of defense cooperation.Subsequent naval visits have included two other carriers and elements of their strike groups, as well as the U.S. Navy 7th Fleet flagship and a U.S. Coast Guard vessel calling at Cam Ranh last summer.These visible shows of support are complemented by growing depth and sophistication in U.S. arms transfers, most recently the November 2024 delivery of T-6 trainer aircraft (and an indication that F-16s could be next), as well as a prior transfer of two cutters and 18 patrol boats.Most of this defense cooperation is maricreated_at in nature, but cybersecurity is another growth area.The steady drumbeat of new 'firsts' in the U.S.-Vietnam defense relationship is consistent with the  perception that 'there is nowhere on earth more fearful of Chinese hegemony than Vietnam.'This may be so-but overlapping regional security concerns are only one facet of Hanoi's threat perceptions.As Vietnamese analysts observe: 'If Vietnam goes with China, they may lose the country.If they go with [the] U.S., they may lose the regime.'This dilemma encapsulates Hanoi's hybrid strategy, which seeks to commit both great powers to underwriting different aspects of Vietnam's security.Growing cooperation with the United States, therefore, does not mean that Hanoi will be willing to sacrifice its relationship to Beijing for the sake of ongoing, or even increased, support from Washington.Even as U.S.-Vietnam defense ties mature, Hanoi has cultivated a deep security partnership with China.Unlike cooperation with Washington, however, which focuses on external defense and regional maricreated_at security, Vietnam's security cooperation with Beijing focuses on shoring up both regimes against threats to party rule.Xi's highest national security priority is ' political security,' which operationally speaking means the security of the socialist system, Chinese Communist Party leadership of that system, and Xi's place as the core of the leadership.U.S. national security strategists must accept that Vietnam's leaders are similarly oriented around political security.This has played out over the course of the past two years in the frequency and seniority of internal security interaction between China and Vietnam.Vietnam's leaders have met with every part of China's domestic security apparatus-the public security minister, state security minster, justice minister, head of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, head of the People's Armed Police, etc.-often more than once.Placed against the parade of Chinese security ministers passing through Hanoi or hosting counterparts in Beijing, Washington's working-level efforts to increase the  participation of women in law enforcement (in keeping with the United Nations' Women, Peace, and Security agenda) are laudable but do not address the fundamental security needs that drive Vietnam's strategic choices.Hanoi's prioritization was on vivid display during Xi's visit to Hanoi in December 2023.Xi  called on both sides to 'prioritize national political security, ensure the red flag of socialism not to be changed, and spare no effort to prevent, defuse and contain all kinds of political and security risks.'Vietnam, in turn, welcomed and supported Xi's Global Security Initiative, which Chinese analysts have described as a foreign-policy extension of Xi's regime-focused comprehensive national security concept.To implement this cooperation, China engages with Vietnam's police, security, and intelligence organs to maintain ' social stability and ethnic unity.'In 2024, Lam, then internal security chief, stepped into Vietnam's top leadership role.In the months preceding his ascent, Lam had led a drive to 'strengthen cooperation between China's law enforcement and security departments and Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security (MPS) in the fields of security and intelligence, especially in safeguarding regime security and institutional security.'In August, during Lam's state visit to Beijing, his replacement as public security minister, Luong Tam Quang,  met with both Public Security Minister Wang Xiaohong and State Security Minister Chen Yixin.The state visit followed joint anti-terrorism exercises between the MPS and the People's Armed Police.Vietnam has also participated in Chinese police training.Even as the Pentagon works with Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence toward a vision of 'regional peace and prosperity' that depends on countering China at sea, Vietnam's internal security apparatus has pursued close ties with China to counter liberal influence and opposition forces-many of which they believe emanate from the United States and its global democracy promotion agenda.Vietnam's basic security principles more closely resemble China's, with  decades-old commitments to counter 'human rights and democracy ploys to interfere in Vietnam's internal affairs.'Today, its internal security cooperation with China focuses on 'intelligence exchanges, anti-interference, anti-separatism, and strengthening experience sharing and cooperation on preventing the 'peaceful evolution' of reactionary and hostile forces, 'color revolutions,' and separatism.'This fits in a broader arc of Chinese security cooperation focused on domestic threats along its regional periphery, whether these are joint counterterrorism exercises with Central Asian partners inside Xinjiang or a joint research center with Cambodia to study how to prevent color revolutions.This strategy of dual-track,  non-monogamous security cooperation shows Vietnam's intent to chart an autonomous course amid intensifying regional and global strategic competition.This strategy has its origins in the Cold War, when Vietnam's alignment with the Soviet Union made it a target of Chinese attack; Russia's war in Ukraine seems to have increased Hanoi's concern about being trampled by great-power rivalry.In 2019, Vietnam's added to its famous 'three nos'-no military alliances, no alignment with one country against another, and no foreign bases-with a fourth:  no threat or use of force.Yet this same national defense white paper also relaxed the three former categorical prohibitions: 'Depending on circumstances and specific conditions, Viet Nam will consider developing necessary, appropriate defence and military relations with other countries on the basis of respecting each other's independence, sovereignty, territorial unity and integrity.'For Vietnam, security cooperation with both Beijing and Washington makes sense, as each great power offers very different kinds of security benefits.China helps Vietnam's Communist leadership shore up domestic stability and regime security, which ironically could be jeopardized by increased  linkage with the United States.Defense cooperation with Washington, on the other hand, allows Vietnam to counter Chinese maricreated_at power projection and provides a diversifying hedge against strategic subordination to Beijing in the region.In still other areas, including the region's diverse and nontraditional security needs-including cybercrime and transnational human trafficking and drug smuggling-Hanoi cooperates with both Beijing and Washington, as opportunities arise.In July 2024, Vietnam and the United States  launched the inaugural Law Enforcement and Security Dialogue; three weeks later, Vietnam participated in China's regional law enforcement program, the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Framework, endorsing its most recent joint statement on combating transboundary crimes, which cited the riparian nations' joint law enforcement patrols and made positive reference to China's Global Security Initiative.For a created_at, part of Vietnam's pursuit of autonomy also involved importing arms from Russia, its traditional defense supplier.But Vietnam placed  no new major orders with Russia in 2023-probably due to Russia's own need to support its grinding and costly invasion of Ukraine.This suggests that Hanoi feels some urgency to look elsewhere to meet its defensive needs.Moscow's unreliability will test the sustainability of Hanoi's current course in the years ahead.Vietnam's choice to work closely on security affairs with both rival great powers should help retire the conventional wisdom that China's only appeal to other countries is economic.Similar dynamics have already emerged in Serbia and Hungary (a NATO ally), as well as the United Arab Emirates, where a 30-year defense partnership with the United States has not precluded accelerating police and surveillance technology  cooperation with China.In some cases, Washington will be able to take steps itself or work with regional partners such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea to address legitimate nontraditional and internal security needs and provide capacity-building, training, and other assistance on issues such as counternarcotics and combating human trafficking.In other instances, where the partner's goal is explicitly authoritarian regime survival, Washington will have to recognize its limitations because Beijing is offering assistance that it cannot and should not mimic.Overall, U.S. policy will benefit by better accounting for the growing degree of agency wielded by third countries.Vietnam would be a good place to start.Link to the original story.N"

    "created_at": "2025-01-13",
    "text": "\nIn March 2024, Philippine Coast Guard vessel BRP Sindangan was involved in a skirmish with Chinese ships in the disputed South China Sea waters. \n Chinese ships had fired water cannon and tried to block off the Philippine contingent on a resupply mission to the Second Thomas Shoal, some 105 nautical miles west of the Philippine province of Palawan. \n That direct clash was just one of a growing number of such confrontations between the two sides in 2024, which marked one of the most tense periods in bilateral relations. \n While both sides have pointed the finger, China's reputation has taken a hit from such exchanges. In recent years, Chinese actions taken to protect what it considers important national interests have created friction in the region, beyond territorial disputes. \n Although some countries might have a benign view of China and its rise, others are less sure after a less than positive first-hand experience. \n Such incidents have fuelled regional anxieties, and perhaps made it more difficult for other countries to avoid viewing China's rise with suspicion, even worry. \n The distrust could colour how South-east Asia approaches China and undo the goodwill earned from China's valuable role as an engine of regional growth and prosperity. \n China's ascendance as a superpower is not preordained, and less of a given with sharpened pressure from the US with a Donald Trump return to the presidency, rising trade tensions over Chinese overcapacity, and a slowing economy expected in 2025. In this unfriendly environment, it could benefit from having South-east Asia in its corner. \n Beijing should hence consider how being a great power does not come conferred with the right to an unconstrained exercise of raw power and leverage. It could require instead empathy for smaller countries. \n Growing military might In December 2024, this correspondent visited the very same BRP Sindangan, whose commanding officer told a group of journalists from the region about the regular encounters  with Chinese ships over the  past year. \n He demonstrated stoicism in his recollection and emphasised that Philippine sailors had to maintain professionalism and follow established protocols. \n His eyewitness account struck a chord with participants. We were part of the Jefferson Fellowship journalism exchange programme, run by the US East-West Center think-tank. On visits to Hawaii, Manila and Taipei, the topic of China and the security challenges its growing military prowess posed was never far from the agenda, which was focused on regional security issues. \n The backdrop was China's accelerating build-up of its nuclear arsenal, fighter jets and amphibious warships, which were watched closely by regional countries, including large neighbours like India. \n A poorly demarcated border has long been a source of friction between the two Asian giants. New Delhi remains distrustful of Chinese intentions, even after a border deal in October 2024 to de-escalate tensions. \n These insecurities are not helped by China's rhetoric and signalling on Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its territory. Taiwan has reported increasing airspace intrusions since 2020, in addition to more regular Chinese drills around the island. \n The scare tactics and threat of open conflict do not bolster the view that China's military growth is purely defensive, as it often claims. \n In the economic and diplomatic realm, small countries that have benefited from cooperation with China have increasingly started to count the costs. \n Take the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure investment programme, which has brought much-needed facilities to developing countries -- from a high-speed rail connecting Jakarta to Bandung to satellite television for 1,000 villages in Mozambique. \n Yet here, generous aid has made Pacific Island nations more wary about the implications, including undue Chinese influence, fellow participants of the Jefferson Fellowship shared. \n In Vanuatu, a Chinese-funded and built presidential palace in the seaside capital of Port Vila handed over in July 2024 raised questions about potential strings attached, after a slew of infrastructure projects built by Beijing in the country. The Vanuatu government has not disclosed the total debt the country owes to China. \n China's BRI has long been accused of serving as an instrument for \"debt trap diplomacy\" -- by creating dependence on China with loans that small developing nations might have difficulty repaying, making them vulnerable to coercion. \n In the Solomon Islands, concerns have been publicly raised over Chinese influence, after China funded media equipment to two local newspapers and later asked for the publication of content on the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election favourable to China. \n The news seemed consistent with reports of recent Chinese efforts to amplify sympathetic narratives in foreign media. \n In short, there is greater scepticism about such cooperation -- even when these were hailed by Beijing as \"win-win\". \n Security dilemmaTo be sure, China is also responding to what it feels are challenges to its own security and a reasonable need to protect national interests. \n American predominance in the Asia-Pacific and its continued military deployments, in China's view, are unfriendly moves that threaten the country. \n For instance, Beijing sees the 2024 deployment of the US Typhon missile system in the Philippines -- which Manila in December said it was interested in acquiring permanently -- as threatening because it can fire missiles far enough to hit the Chinese mainland, and has derided Manila's choice as one dictated by the US. \n In the South China Sea, China's muscular approach has often drawn consternation, but the Philippines may not have helped its cause with its \"transparency initiative\" under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, which seems tilted towards the US. \n The government initiative purports to expose the coercive and unlawful behaviour of Chinese ships at sea, such as the one in March 2024 involving water cannon, through government communications and the media. \n The initiative has worked in raising public awareness of such tensions. But some have questioned whether these have truly secured the Philippines' maricreated_at sovereignty or served only to politicise the territory dispute and invite more Chinese pushback. \n On the other hand, Chinese behaviour has clearly catalysed wider public anxiety. As a Philippine university student in Manila told me over a casual conversation: \"I hope that there is no conflict, but we have to stand up for our rights.\" \n A scandal that surfaced in  May 2024 only deepened suspicions of China in Manila, when the Chinese Embassy released a recorded phone call with a Philippine navy admiral. \n The leaked audio recording suggested a secret deal for managing tensions over the Second Thomas Shoal, discussed between China's military attache in Manila and Vice-Admiral Alberto Carlos, which supposedly included how Manila would notify Beijing in advance of a resupply mission. \n Philippine officials have denied any such deal. Analysts have said the Chinese manoeuvre had the effect of sowing discord in the Philippines. \n Tactics by Chinese ships have also made for poor optics. Water cannon are meant to be used for putting out fires at sea, a senior Philippine military official told the Jefferson fellows, not for intimidation. \n Strategic empathyA more powerful China is likely to continue using all tools at its disposal to achieve its aims, even if such actions are perceived as unfair by other countries. \n How then can China gain greater acceptance for a peaceful rise? \n In his 2020 book, Battlegrounds: The Fight To Defend The Free World, former US national security adviser H.R. McMaster outlined the importance of superpowers having \"strategic empathy\" to avoid strategic failures and reject narcissistic tendencies. \n He argued that superpowers had to understand how the world looked to others and how their history, perceptions and aspirations influence policy and action. \n Strategic empathy means a big country should consider the needs and concerns of others and be willing to adapt its behaviour accordingly. \n For China, having awareness of how actions to protect its interest could be perceived as bullying could be a start. \n This entails toning down on its \"wolf warrior\" style diplomacy and avoiding the stoking of concerns over longstanding disputes that have no easy solutions. Chinese spokespeople appear to have cut back on provocative and combative responses to foreign policy issues, which were heightened during the Covid-19 pandemic. \n A greater ask would be for China to go further and acknowledge the legitimate anxieties around assertive Chinese actions. That would entail calming tensions in the South China Sea through genuine communication instead of aggressive ground manoeuvres. It would also require greater transparency in offers of Chinese assistance. \n In China's drive to be a great power, persuasion, restraint and tact may somecreated_ats be more effective than the use of might to get the region on its side. \n\nGraphic\n \nChinese coast guard vessels firing water cannon towards a Philippine resupply vessel on March 5. Although some countries might have a benign view of China and its rise, others are less sure after a less than positive first-hand experience. PHOTO: REUTERS\n"

    "text": "\n The Philippine government has filed a diplomatic protest against the continued illegal presence and operations of Chinese Coast Guard vessels within the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nIn a statement on Monday, the National Maricreated_at Council (NMC) aired the Philippines' objection to the continued illegal presence and activities of Chinese maricreated_at forces and militia within the country's territorial sea and EEZ.\nAccording to NMC, these actions clearly violate Republic Act No. 12064, the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, and international laws, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 arbitral ruling.\n'The vessels and air assets of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) were immediately deployed when the illegal presence and operations of China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels, CCG 5901 and CCG 3304, were respectively detected on [January] 5 and 10, 2025 in and around the waters of Bajo de Masinloc and about 70-90 nautical miles from the coastlines of the province of Zambales,' said NMC.\n'The PCG continuously challenged CCG 5901 and CCG 3304 and told them to leave the area immediately,' it added.\nBut NMC said the Chinese government, in a provocative move, also deployed a People's Liberation Army-Navy (PLA-N) helicopter, which hovered above a PCG vessel lawfully carrying out its duties in a peaceful and professional manner.\n'The Philippines strongly opposes the continued illegal presence and operations of the CCG vessels, as well as the provocative actions of the PLA-N helicopter, within the country's maricreated_at zones,' said NMC.\nThe agency then argued that the Philippines has long-standing sovereignty over Bajo de Masinloc and its territorial sea.\n'Likewise, the Philippines has sovereign rights and jurisdiction beyond Bajo de Masinloc's territorial sea, over waters within the Philippines' EEZ measured from its lawful archipelagic baselines. These maricreated_at zones, as declared in the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, are under the 1982 UNCLOS and the 2016 Arbitral Ruling. China does not have any basis to conduct law enforcement activities or maricreated_at patrols over these waters,' it emphasized.\n'In view of the situation, the Philippines has filed the appropriate diplomatic protest to counter China's recent illegal actions in the West Philippine Sea,' NMC concluded.\nNo details have been provided yet about the diplomatic protest filed against China, but INQUIRER.net has requested more information from the Department of Foreign Affairs.\nChina's continued aggression in Philippine waters is borne out of its sweeping claims over most of the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea.\nThis claim, however, has long been dismissed by an arbitral tribunal.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) on Sunday said China might infringe upon other countries’ exclusive economic zone (EEZs) if its vessel deployments in Philippine waters remain unchallenged.\nThis was after China’s largest coast guard ship returned to the Philippines’ EEZ in the South China Sea and tried to move closer toward the Zambales coastline.\nBeijing’s goal is “to normalize such deployments, and if these actions go unnoticed and unchallenged, it will enable them to alter the existing status quo,” Philippine Coast Guard spokesman Jay Tristan Tarriela said in a statement, citing satellite imagery.\n“This strategy of normalization, followed by altering the status quo and ultimately operationalizing their illegal narrative, has consistently been part of the Chinese playbook,” he added.\nThe PCG on Saturday marked the eighth day of “monitoring and vigilant pursuit” of China Coast Guard vessels “illegally operating” within the Philippine EEZ.\nThe PCG first reported the presence of China Coast Guard-5901 on Jan. 5, saying it had promptly dispatched the 44.5-meter BRP Cabra after the “monster ship” was detected using Canada’s dark vessel detection system.\nThe ship’s erratic movements within the Philippine EEZ “indicate it is not engaged in innocent passage,” the PCG said, adding that it was “conducting a law enforcement operation, claiming jurisdiction over these waters as belonging to the People’s Republic of China.”\nIn the afternoon of Jan. 8, the PCG said China’s monster ship had left the coastline of Zambales and was set to be replaced by China Coast Guard- 3103, which left Guangdong Province on Jan. 7.\nBut on Jan. 9, the PCG noted that China Coast Guard vessel-3103 was being replaced by vessel 3304, which was “illegally sailing” about 70-80 nautical miles (129.6-148.2 kilometers) off the coast of Zambales on Jan. 10.\nOn Saturday, the PCG said BRP Teresa Magbanua gradually pushed away vessel 3304 from the coastline of Zambales, prompting Beijing to redeploy its monster ship in an attempt to outmaneuver the Philippine ship.\n“Despite the imposing size of CCG-5901, the PCG vessel has boldly approached its starboard side at a close range, effectively hindering the China Coast Guard vessel’s attempts to move towards the Zambales coastline,” the PCG said.\nIt said the monster ship was positioned 97 nautical miles off the coast of Zambales.\nMr. Tarriela said China could be emboldened to infringe upon the EEZ of other nations such as Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia if the international community remains passive amid the “illegal deployment” of China’s maricreated_at forces.\nExecutive Secretary Lucas P. Bersamin, who heads the National Maricreated_at Council, earlier said the Philippines government views the monster ship’s presence within the Philippine EEZ “with concern.”\n“The Coast Guard, our Coast Guard, has always been very alert in following up the presence of that monster ship.”\nMr. Tarriela said the PCG would continue to “actively expose” to the global community what it said were unlawful deployments of Chinese vessels, “ensuring that such actions are not normalized and that this bullying behavior does not succeed.”\n"

    "text": "\nKuala Lampur, Jan. 13 -- In response to Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad's reported remark: \"Why fuss over a rock?\" on January 10, 2025, when commenting on his administration's decision to withdraw Malaysia's application for a review of the Batu Puteh case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Associate Professor Dr Mohd Hazmi Mohd Rusli raises the question: \"Is Pulau Batu Puteh merely a rock in the sea?\"\nIf Malaysia's loss of Pulau Batu Puteh in 2008 was a shocking event for many, it must be even more shocking that such a remark like \"Why fuss over a rock?\" is made by an elder statesman.\nWhy fuss over a rock?\nPulau Batu Puteh is a granite island, measuring 137 metres long, with an average width of 60 metres and covering an area of about 8,560 sq metres at low tide. It is situated at the eastern entrance of the Straits of Singapore, at the point where the latter opens up into the South China Sea.\nPulau Batu Puteh is located at 1deg 19' 48\" N and 104deg 24' 27\" E. It lies approximately 24 nautical miles to the east of Singapore, 7.7 nautical miles to the south of the Malaysian state of Johor and 7.6 nautical miles to the north of the Indonesian island of Bintan.\nOn the island stands Horsburgh lighthouse, which was erected in the middle of the nineteenth century. Today, Pulau Batu Puteh also hosts a military rebroadcast station, a helipad, a desalination plant and a communications tower.\nOn December 21, 1979, Malaysia published a map entitled \"Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia\" (the 1979 map). The map depicted Pulau Batu Puteh as lying within Malaysia's territorial waters.\nBy a Diplomatic Note dated February 14, 1980, Singapore rejected Malaysia's claim to Pulau Batu Puteh and requested that the 1979 map be corrected. This led to an exchange of correspondence and subsequently to a series of intergovernmental talks in 1993-1994, which did not bring a resolution of the matter.\nWhy fuss over a rock?\nIn view of the lack of progress in the bilateral negotiations, both parties agreed to submit the dispute for resolution by the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\nBy joint letter dated July 24, 2003, Malaysia and Singapore notified to the Registrar a Special Agreement between the two States, signed at Putrajaya on February 6, 2003, and having entered into force on May 9, 2003.\nIn that Special Agreement they requested the ICJ to determine whether sovereignty over Pulau Batu Puteh/Pedra Branca (white rock in Portuguese), Middle Rocks and South Ledge belongs to Malaysia or Singapore.\nDr Mahathir was prime minister from July 16, 1981 to October 31, 2003.\nWhy fuss over a rock?\n* This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

Such initiatives are desirable because they will also help increase the number of people who are knowledgeable about Japan.\nIshiba and Prabowo also affirmed their view to hold a two-plus-two meeting of Japanese and Indonesian foreign and defense ministers within the year, and to advance discussions among their defense authorities toward the joint development of naval vessels.\nIndonesia has deepened its relations with China, but the two countries have been at odds over interests in the South China Sea. It is important for Japan and Indonesia to deepen their defense cooperation.\nIshiba also held a meeting with his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim, at which they agreed to move forward with the concept of decarbonizing Asia that was proposed by the administration of former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\nBased on this concept, a project to construct a plant in Malaysia that will produce hydrogen without emitting carbon dioxide has been already launched with the participation of Japanese companies. It is desirable to make use of Japan's top-notch knowledge and technology to help ASEAN nations combat global warming.\nIn recent years, China has strengthened its influence in the region by supporting ASEAN countries on the economic front. Many of the ASEAN nations have criticized Beijing's hegemonic activities, but their real desire is probably to avoid a decisive confrontation.\nEven if Japan were to loftily advocate the importance of the rule of law and other universal values, it likely would not be easy to change this stance of the ASEAN countries.\nFor many years, Japan has supported each of the ASEAN countries through official development assistance, but in recent years, it has come to rely on them as a source of human resources. It is vital for Japan and ASEAN nations to continue to work together on an equal footing and further develop trust between them.\n(From The Yomiuri Shimbun, Jan. 12, 2025)\n"

    "text": "\n2025 JAN 13 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Energy Daily News -- Fresh data on Energy are presented in a new report. According to news originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Subterranean oil and gas reserves are abundant, offering significant potential for exploration and development. However, oil and gas drilling often suffers from low efficiency due to the dense rock layers encountered.\" \n Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the China University of Petroleum, \"A major cause of this inefficiency is the rapid wear of bits, which significantly reduces their performance. This not only increases the created_at spent on inefficient drilling but also leads to frequent bit changes, adding to nonproductive created_at.Therefore, this study focuses on the wear prediction of the widely used polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit in oil and gas drilling operations. In this study, we focused on exploring and validating the smooth wear failure mode of PDC bits in sandstone and mudstone formations. Based on this pattern, we modified the traditional wear mechanism model to suit a data- driven approach and in-tegrated the nonparametric intelligent algorithm, Gaussian process regression (GPR), which performs well with small sample data, for characterizing bit performance. Finally, we applied an adaptive differential evolution (ADE) algorithm to extract the cumulative wear characteristics curve that leads to the degradation of bit performance.This method has been applied to multiple wells in the southwestern China block and the South China Sea block, achieving more than 90% accuracy in model predictions with small sample data. Furthermore, when this method is incorporated into an engineering parameter optimization model, it further unlocks the potential for bit penetration. In practical field applications, it not only enhances the bit footage but also significantly improves overall created_at efficiency by 11% and 59%, respectively.\" \n According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The application of this method can assist field engineers in identifying inefficient states in oil and gas drilling operations, thereby reducing nonproductive operation created_at and guiding engineering parameters to enhance drilling efficiency.\" \n This research has been peer-reviewed. \n For more information on this research see: Mechanism and Data Fusion Method for Predicting Wear and Life of Polycrystalline Diamond Compact Bits Based On the Gaussian Process Regression.

    "created_at": "2025-01-13",
    "text": "\nPHILIPPINE President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. might need to persuade US President-elect Donald J. Trump about the wisdom of continuing to deepen trade ties between the two nations amid the threat of higher US tariffs, according to analysts.\n“President Marcos, who seems to have a good relationship with President Trump, will want to develop a clear narrative about how trade with the Philippines benefits the US,” Raymond M. Powell, a fellow at Stanford University’s Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, said in an X message. “Donald Trump is known to listen to compelling arguments from friends he trusts.”\nHe noted that Mr. Trump was elected in part due to dissatisfaction with recent inflation trends, “so some of his advisors will likely counsel caution in making tariffs so broad-based that they drive up prices for average US consumers.”\nMr. Trump broached the idea of a “free and open” Indo-Pacific region when he first became president in 2017 at the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum in Manila.\nHis successor, Joseph R. Biden, also supported the concept, launching the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity in 2022 with Australia, Brunei, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.\n“I am cautiously optimistic that the Trump administration policy toward the Philippines on both security and economics will be consistent with the Biden administration’s,” said Gregory B. Poling, a fellow of the Southeast Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nHe noted that the first Trump government deepened the alliance and US commitment to a free South China Sea, and that a number of Republican members of Congress close to Mr. Trump had helped push major funding commitments to the Philippines in 2024.\n“Trump’s pledge to impose universal tariffs on other countries will of course raise costs for US imports from the Philippines, but if those tariffs are imposed on every country, then it won’t harm the Philippines’ competitive advantage,” he added.\nMr. Poling said the US would likely remain committed to key priorities of a proposed Luzon Economic Corridor that include developing the Subic Freeport zone in Zambales province north of the Philippine capital. He added that it was the Trump government that had helped rescue the Hanjin Shipyard at the former site of a US military base when it went bankrupt.\nThe shipyard, owned by Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction Philippines, was acquired by US private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for $300 million in March 2022 after exclusive talks launched by a consortium of US and Australian companies in 2019 amid China’s interest in the shipyard.\n“President-elect Trump is also clearly interested in reducing US vulnerability to Chinese market manipulations that he considers cheating,” Mr. Powell said.\n“President Marcos will want to develop recommendations on how the Philippines, as a staunch friend of America, is a place that can help replace China as a trustworthy source of materials and components that can help reinvigorate the US manufacturing sector,” he added.\n‘NOT JUST A TAKER’\nThe stability of the South China Sea and the wider Indo-Pacific region amid China’s growing assertiveness at sea has been a cornerstone of Philippine-US relations.\nWashington, which has a Mutual Defense Treaty with Manila, has always condemned the Chinese Coast Guard’s frequent use of water cannons to block Philippine resupply missions to Second Thomas Shoal where it has a handful of soldiers, and to Filipino fishermen near Scarborough Shoal.\nMr. Marcos, speaking before the Australian Parliament earlier in 2024, said his country was on the frontline of a battle for regional peace.\n“Of course, President Marcos can also explain how the Philippines stands alone among the Southeast Asian nations in resisting China’s aggression in the region, and is therefore not just a ‘taker,’ but is actually a bold and determined ally in holding back Beijing’s plan to push the US out of Asia,” Mr. Powell said.\nThe Philippines under Mr. Marcos has pursued closer economic and defense ties with the US amid growing tensions with China.\nThe return to power of Mr. Trump, who has announced protectionist policies including higher tariffs after his presidential win, has raised questions for America’s Indo-Pacific allies including the Philippines, which has been a major beneficiary of Washington’s pivot to the region.\nDuring the campaign, the populist leader said he wanted to impose 60% or higher tariffs on all Chinese goods and a 10% universal tariff.\nThe White House under Mr. Biden announced key economic projects for its former colony, including a commitment from its Department of Commerce and private sector to double the number of Philippine semiconductor plants as part of efforts to diversify American supply chains.\nAfter a trilateral meeting among Mr. Marcos, Mr. Biden and former Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, the US bared a plan to put up an economic corridor on the main Philippine island of Luzon.\nThe so-called Luzon Economic Corridor seeks to boost connectivity between the capital Manila, Batangas province and Subic, Zambales and Clark, Pampanga — the site of two former US military bases.\nThe economic corridor, which is under the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, also aims for other “high-impact” infrastructure projects such as ports and strategic investments in semiconductors, clean energy and supply chains.\nFrederick D. Go, Mr. Marcos’ investment and economic adviser, in November said the Asian Development Bank was finalizing the terms of the project’s feasibility study. “It’s all systems go. Right now, it’s for the Subic-Clark-Manila-Batangas Rail,” he said.\nHe added that trilateral partners that include the US and Japan had promised to pursue the Luzon Economic Corridor even under Mr. Trump. Other countries want to join the corridor, and the Philippines was in talks to make it “more inclusive to the other countries.”\n‘STABLE AND GROWING’\nManila was set to submit proposed trade agreements to the US, Mr. Go said. “We certainly want to bring forward to the new Trump administration our various requests,” he said. “We have of course a few trade agreement requests that the Philippines would like to push that will enhance trade between the Philippines and the US.”\nThe US is the biggest destination of Philippine-made goods in November, with exports valued at $969.09 million or 17% of the total export sales. It was followed by Japan with $916.12 million (16.1% share) and China with $786.35 million (13.8%).\n“US investments in the Philippines continue to be stable and growing,” Tereso O. Panga, director-general at the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), said in a Viber message. “At the onset of the current administration, the Philippines made sure to renew and reinvigorate ties with the US.”\nThe early years of ex-President Rodrigo R. Duterte were marked by his anti-American rhetoric as he started a pivot to China away from the Philippines’ traditional western allies in 2016.\nThe tough-talking leader threatened on several occasions to terminate a US-Philippines visiting forces agreement as he accused Washington of failing to deliver on its military aid commitments.\nMr. Panga said the Marcos government is “consistently engaging” with the US International Trade Administration, an agency under the US Department of Commerce, to “further the presence of US businesses in the Philippines.”\nHe said many PEZA-registered US companies are long-term investors and are continually expanding in the Philippines. “A second Trump administration will continue with their policy as part of their thrust in ally-shoring.”\nThere are more than 300 US companies in the Philippines, 247 of which are in the information technology and business process outsourcing sectors and 70 in manufacturing, Mr. Panga said.\n“PEZA remains the home of premier US locators and foresees this to continue onwards under President-elect Donald Trump.”\nIn his congratulatory message for Mr. Trump, Mr. Marcos cited “unshakable” Philippine-US ties that have been “tested in war and peace.”\n“It is clear from his past actions and statements that Donald Trump favors protectionist tariffs as a key element in his program to restore the American industry and reduce trade imbalances,” Mr. Powell said. “There will be discussion about the imposition of tariffs on US trading partners, especially those which, like the Philippines, have a trade surplus with America.”\n"

    "text": "\nJan. 13—JAKARTA(The Jakarta Post/ANN) — One of the highlights of Foreign Minister Sugiono's first foreign policy speech late last week was the prominent display of images of Indonesia's first president Sukarno as a backdrop for the event.\nFor those attending the speech, one of the most memorable scenes was when the image of Sukarno with global south leaders like then-Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and then-Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser during the Bandung Asia-Africa conference in 1955 was projected on stage.\nSukarno, a nationalist hero for post-reformasi politicians, is an avatar for Indonesia's muscular foreign policy and the projection of his image in Sugiono's first major foreign policy speech served an obvious purpose.\nIt is now clear, especially after the formal accession of Indonesia into the BRICS grouping only two days before the annual speech, that President Prabowo Subianto wants to raise the profile of Indonesia on the global stage, to play in the big league and if necessary to punch above its weight.\nMinister Sugiono's speech last Friday outlined some major initiatives that mark a radical departure from the transactional approach of Prabowo's predecessor Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo.\nThe biggest move of course was the decision to join BRICS, a bloc of regional powers which include Russia and China, a move that Sugiono does not see as a deviation from Indonesia's free and active foreign policy.\nIn the speech, Sugiono said Indonesia's presence in the group \"could be the bridge for countries in the developing world and in the Indo-Pacific as well a conduit to prevent geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions.\"\nAlso outlined by the foreign minister was the plan to join the efforts to reform the United Nations and international financial institutions to make them \"fit-for purpose\" and to prevent them \"from being dominated by rich nations\".\nOn the international trade front, the minister aired another grievance over unfair practices in international trade and said that Indonesia would push for a fairer trade.\n\"In our economic diplomacy, we cannot sit still. But we should respond to the practices and any economic policies that are unfair, including [those unfair] toward Indonesia's key commodities. To this end, we will pursue a more inclusive and fair global economic architecture that makes sure the voices of the developing nations are heard,\" Sugiono said.\nSugiono also made a pledge in the latter part of the speech to expand Indonesia's existing defense partnerships and step up its handling of strategic issues impacting its sovereignty, including maricreated_at security and the safety of sea passage and fisheries.\nOther goals like the completion of a code of conduct between ASEAN and China in the South China Sea and the prioritization of ASEAN's centrality show some competing agenda priorities for the next year or two.\nAnd with possible blowbacks from some of the steps taken in the first months of Prabowo's administration, including joining BRICS and reaching out to the Kremlin, the next few years will be busy for Indonesia.\nWe should applaud President Prabowo for taking a bold step to engage on a deeper level in global politics.\nWe can certainly ask the logistical question of how the government will pay for upgrading the military hardware or how it will increase the amount of international aid, while domestic priorities such as the free meals program demand large government resources.\nAnd then there is the question of how the new foreign minister will mobilize the resources and reorganize the lumbering bureaucracy, especially at the Foreign Ministry, to implement the fresh plans and priorities of the new administration.\n___ (c)2025 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

    "text": "\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 58px;\">E</span></strong></span></span>ach generation is convinced that it faces a more uncertain and threatening world than any before it, a crisis of unprecedented proportions, and that man's very survival is at stake. We are no exception, judging by the commentaries in the media. And yet, mankind has not only survived but steadily improved its lot. More people live longer, healthier and more prosperous lives than ever before in history.</p> <p>One explanation for this paradox or contradiction between our objective condition and the way we perceive it is the idea of a world order. We have been conditioned into assuming that a world order is normal and beneficial by the bipolar Cold War and the subsequent unipolar moment, when first two and then one superpower dominated and ordered the world. \nOne can understand why a hegemon would want us to think so.</p> <p>But what do history and experience tell us? In fact, world orders have been the exception in history. For most of history, there has not been a world order. It is only when there is a tremendous imbalance in the distribution of power, as under the Mongols in the 13th century, with Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and with the US and, briefly, the USSR after World War II, that there has been a world order. And those were not necessarily the most peaceful created_ats. Unlike the Cold War, when over 80 per cent of world military and economic power was controlled by the two superpowers through their blocs, the two largest powers, the US and China, control less than 50 per cent of world GDP and military power today. Power, therefore, is much more evenly distributed in the world than in periods when a world order obtained.</p> <drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ckeditor_image\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.image\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2690fabe-a17f-45ff-b603-9c90c081f951\" data-langcode=\"en\"></drupal-entity> <p>History also tells us that the most innovative periods and the created_ats when some of the most significant economic progress was made, were when the international order was disputed, often hotly. The Axial Age in the 6th century BCE and the industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries occurred when warfare was endemic and the order was disputed. The re-emergence of China and India as significant economies on a global scale has occurred without a great power war. This suggests that the benefits of a world order may be exaggerated and overestimated.</p> <p>And where are we today? Clearly, the world order that the West, led by the US, created and managed after WWII is disputed politically even while all countries are part of the global capitalist market system that order built. The ineffectiveness of the institutions of global governance and the multilateral organisations that underpinned the post-WWII order is evident in the pathetic international response to the Covid pandemic, in the decline of the WTO, and in the multiple conflicts and hotspots that are alive, ranging from Ukraine, Sudan, Palestine, Yemen, Congo to the Himalayas, the South China Sea, Taiwan, the East China Sea and multiple other areas. Great power rivalry is rampant, with China-US contention the principal contradiction. Deaths by conflict and refugees, both internally displaced and external migrants, are at record levels since WWII.</p> <p>This is now a world between orders. In this respect, the world can be said to have returned to its normal state of competing powers of differing capacities and advantages seeking mastery and control over their own futures. Today, there is one globalised economy with at least three poles—in North America, the EU, and in Asia centred on China through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). On the other hand, politics is increasingly local, and there is only one military superpower that can project military power where it wishes, when it wishes, across the globe: namely, the United States. The world is thus multipolar economically, unipolar militarily, and fragmented politically.</p> <p>The absence of order is evident in both aspects of what an order promises: the maintenance of peace and security and in the formation and application of norms and rules.</p> <p><span style=\"font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 58px;\">W</span></strong></span>hat has occurred in West Asia after the horrific terrorist attack by Hamas in October 2023, and Israel's brutal response, which continued through 2024, has shown the limitations of powers other than the US outside their immediate peripheries. This is not a multipolar world, though many governments like to say it is since it flatters them to project themselves as a present or future pole.</p> <p>The scale of the humanitarian disaster in Palestine has also shown the limited ability of the international state-system and multilateral organisations. It is unreasonable to expect organisations established and run by member-states to be effective when those member-states are quarrelling with each other.</p> <p>The past decade has shown us that there is presently no world order capable of dealing with transnational threats like climate change, global terrorism, and the developing country debt crisis. There has not been a binding international agreement on an issue of consequence for over a decade. In the absence of a settled or agreed order, nor are we able to regulate new domains like cyberspace or technologies like AI that offer opportunities that seem to be matched only by the risks they could pose.</p> <p>A consequence of an absent order is great power rivalry, jostling to assert themselves and their interests. The unintended consequence of great power rivalry is the opening up of opportunities for middle and other powers to play the great powers off against one another and to pursue their own agendas, whether it is Russia in the Ukraine, Israel in Palestine and Syria and against Iran, Turkey in Syria, or China in the South China Sea and the Himalayas, Azerbaijan with Armenia, and even the Maldives vis-a-vis India. Instances of opportunism are legion and multiplying.</p> <p>What does this mean for the world in 2025? Will the re-election of Trump as US president change the dynamic of international relations and geopolitics? Individual leaders like Trump could exacerbate or soften some trends. For instance, China-US rivalry could become more acute if Trump does not manage to strike a deal provoked by his tariff threats and overcome his natural inclination to isolationism; US-Russia relations could improve somewhat; and US allies in Asia, like Japan and South Korea, could be forced to strike further out on their own in looking after their own security. But such shifts are likely to be on the margin rather than affecting the basic trends, because most of the factors mentioned above are structural and intrinsic to the nature of the present international system.</p> <drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"ckeditor_image\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.image\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"e8e2ff92-aab3-48a9-b80f-0a34e0d7bd40\" data-langcode=\"en\"></drupal-entity> <p>Nor should one expect coherent and coordinated international responses to transnational challenges like climate change or debt or terrorism. Indeed, the lack of an order brings into question the conÂ­Â­tÂ­Â­inued steady growth of the world economy.</p> <p>For India, this means that we will be operating in a much more difficult international environment. This is a created_at to concentrate on building our capabilities at home, and on pacifying our periphery. Several countries in the subcontinent are in crisis. In crisis lies opportunity. Now is when we might tighten economic bonds within the subcontinent and become a factor of political and economic security for them in an uncertain world, and to be a provider of security, without becoming an issue in their domestic political turmoil. There is also economic opportunity for a country of India's size and level of development if we are willing to engage economically with the most dynamic economies of the world in Asia east of India. The hard part will be managing the relationship with China until self-strengthening restores deterrence on the border. Both the US and China are increasingly domestically preoccupied. And great power rivalry, such as that between China and the US, also makes space for India and its like-minded partners to influence international outcomes. This will not be easy, but it can be rewarding for a power like India which hopes to improve the working of the international system, something that a rigid world order would oppose, and that the present world between orders permits.</p> <hr /> <p><em>—Shivshankar Menon is a former National Security Advisor and foreign secretary</em></p>\n"

Guo Jiaqun: On November 11, Vice Premier Ho Chi Minh and the UK's Finance Minister Rivers co-chaired the 11th China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue, which resulted in 69 win-win outcomes. In the dialogue, the two sides expressed their common desire to uphold multilateralism and economic globalization, to work to maintain the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, and to build an open world economy based on rules; they considered that China-UK cooperation is beneficial to the development of both countries, will jointly safeguard the safe and stable flow of global supply chains, oppose the decentralization of supply chain, agreed to reduce bilateral investment barriers, promote non-discriminatory and open business environment; the parties reached a number of consensus on industrial, agricultural and energy cooperation, agree to hold a new round of the China UK Trade Commission, China Tech Union Commission and Industrial Cooperation Dialogue, deepen China - UK Modern Industry Partnership and strengthen cooperation on climate change as soon as possible; both sides stressed the financial cooperation as a highlight of China China and the UK, strengthen financial policy and financial regulation cooperation and achieve a variety of practical outcomes on the opening up and interconnection of financial markets.\nThe outcome of the dialogue reflects the breadth and depth of China-UK economic and financial cooperation, and is in line with the trend of economic globalization and multilateralism, which benefits both countries and the world. The Chinese side is willing to take the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries as a guide and implement the outcome of this dialogue, to promote further progress in practical cooperation between the parties, inject new impetus into China-UK relations and add new bright spots to the growth of world economy. KCNA: According to South Korean media, Foreign Minister Wang Yi is coordinating his schedule to visit South Korea next month at the earliest.\nMr. Speaker, is Foreign Minister Wang Yi planning to visit South Korea? Guo Jiaqun: China and Korea are important neighbors and partners, and it is in our mutual interest to promote the healthy and stable development of the relationship between the two countries. I have no specific information on the next high-level bilateral exchanges between China and South Korea.\nReuters: What was the Chinese government's reaction to the US decision to add a Chinese port operator to its latest sanctions list against Russian oil on Friday? Is there any consideration of taking countermeasures? Guo Jiaqun: China has always opposed the generalization of the concept of national security by the US, the interference and restriction of normal trade and economic flows, illegal unilateral sanctions without the basis of international law, and the long arm jurisdiction of China without authorization from the Security Council.\nRT: I would like to ask a question about the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The capture of two North Korean soldiers by the Ukrainian Defense Forces who were fighting for Russia last week confirms North Korea's direct involvement in the conflict with Russia and Ukraine, and Russia' s military cooperation with North Koreans in violation of UN Security Council sanctions against the country. What is the Foreign Ministry's reaction to North Korea' s involvement in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine?\nGuo: I don't know what you're talking about. China's position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear, and we hope that all sides will promote de-escalation and commit to a political solution. Bloomberg: The Philippines has said it has lodged a diplomatic protest against the continued illegal presence and activities of Chinese troops in the Philippines' South China Sea exclusive economic zone.\nEarlier, the Philippines said that the large Chinese Navy vessel 5901 had returned to the area. What is the Foreign Ministry's reaction to this? Guo Jiaqun: China's sovereignty and related rights in the South China Sea are formed in a long historical process, with sufficient historic and legal basis, in accordance with international law and international practice.\nThe Chinese Maricreated_at Police is the legitimate and indisputable enforcement of the law on maricreated_at patrol in the relevant waters. China urges the Philippines to stop the malicious gossip. The Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi ended his New Year's trip to Africa last weekend.\nThe visit was highly regarded by African and international public opinion, who commented that China's commitment to African engagement is equal to that of countries of all sizes, and that cooperation with Africa contributes to sustainable development and promotes long-term stable growth in African countries. Can the speaker further explain the significance of Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit? Guo Gaokun: Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to China was a success and he gave a full account of the visit in a media interview at the end of his visit.\nThe visit follows the tradition of the first New Year visit to Africa by a Chinese foreign minister in 35 years, and is part of a new set of consensus and new achievements in implementing the Six-Point Plan for Modernization and the Ten-point Plan of Action for Partnership, proposed by President Xi Jinping at the Beijing Summit of China-Africa Cooperation Forum in 2024. Wang Yi's visit to the African continent is the first visit by a Chinese foreign minister to Africa after the status of the China-Africa Destiny Community was elevated to an all-weather umbrella. The visit is a testament to the friendship between China and Africa, and a demonstration of China's determination to work together to address the world' s changing climate.\nThe world situation is changing every year, but the initial feeling of equality and support for each other is a rock. The African leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the One China Principle and expressed their condolences for the earthquake disaster in Tibet. The visit promoted cooperation in all fields between China and Africa, and resulted in concrete results in strengthening the exchange of civilizations, promoting green development and deepening agricultural cooperation.\nCentral Africa is a modernist dream, and without African modernization, there is no world modernizations. The visit promoted the coordination of all aspects of China and Africa, to work together to correct the historical injustices faced by Africa and to promote the revival of solidarity in the global South and the construction of a just and rational global governance system. The China-Africa relationship is at the forefront of the development of a model for the construction of community of human destiny.\nReuters: The head of the Tibetan government-in-exile in India, Karen Bing Ba-Deren, said on Sunday that the Chinese government should take into account the customs and fundamental rights of Tibetans in post-disaster reconstruction. What is the Foreign Ministry's reaction to this? Guo Jiaqun: The so-called Tibetan government in exile is a thoroughly separatist political group that is not recognized by any country in the world.\nWe are aware of and remain highly alert to its divisive nature and political plots. We have already reported on the earthquake relief efforts in Tibet's Qinghai-Tibet province. The Standing Committee of the Politburo of CPC also held a meeting to study the deployment of earthquake relief efforts in Tibet on a regular basis.\nSince the earthquake, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, which is headed by Comrade Xi Jinping, the relevant local and departmental authorities have reacted quickly, organized strongly, and the vast majority of Party members and cadres have united in their struggle, so that the rescue forces have overcome the difficulty of high temperatures and oxygen deficiency, competing for seconds to search and rescued the trapped people, minimizing the number of casualties, to prevent earthqakes and to resuscitate the disaster overall smoothly. We are confident that we will win the hard battle against earthquake relief and restore normal production and living order in the affected areas as soon as possible.\nDisclaimer: The Above Content is Auto-Translated\n[Category: Investment Banking, Trading, & Brokerage, Financial/ Capital Market, Events]\nSource: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China\n"

    "text": "\n 13 Jan 2025 (Thai News Agency) PPRP raises the case of the human value of 4 fishermen and the 14th-class prisoner, reflecting the inequality of the government's administration. \"Paethongtarn\" emphasizes the need to preserve the dignity of Thai people on this land.\nChakaj Pattanakitwibul, MP for Phang Nga and deputy leader of the Palang Pracharath Party, Chaimongkol Chairob, MP for Sakon Nakhon and deputy leader of the party, and Dr. ML Korkasiwat Kasemsri, executive committee member of the party, held a press conference after the meeting of MPs and executive committee members chaired by Gen. Prawit Wongsuwan, leader of the Palang Pracharath Party, regarding the incident in which four Thai fishermen were captured by the Myanmar Navy and have not yet been released.\nMr. Chakaj said that the government had previously stated that the Thai crew would return home on January 4, but as of today, they still have not returned home. The government has not provided any clarity, and the relatives of the fishermen want to know the details of what steps are being taken in this matter, not the entire country being silent as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Mr. Phumtham Vejjayachai, told them to keep quiet, or even Prime Minister Ms. Paethongtarn Shinawatra, who could not clarify this matter, saying only that the government is taking action and not to pressure Myanmar yet.\n'I would like the media to help be a voice to bring all the fishing crews back to Thailand as soon as possible because today Thais have nowhere to turn to because the government is ineffective in its operations related to the lives of Thais. It cannot negotiate for their release and also allows Myanmar to accuse and prosecute Thais like this,' said Mr. Chakaj.\nML Korkasiwat said that it has been 45 days since 4 Thais were arrested and 1 died when a Myanmar warship fired at a group of Thai fishing boats in the sea area of ??Ranong Province on 30 November 2014. He believes that this is an excessive action because 1. It occurred near the territorial sea of ??Koh Phayam, Koh Lam, Koh Khan, and Koh Khi Nok, which are considered unresolved sea areas that must be agreed upon because the Treaty of Siam and the British Governor in India did not mention small islands. 2. It\nviolates the Memorandum of Agreement on the Demarcation of the Andaman Sea Area between the Kingdom of Thailand and the Union of Myanmar in 1980, Section 3, which states that any dispute must be resolved peacefully.\n3. The shooting to kill Thais is an excessive action. Compared to international cases such as the conflict in the South China Sea, which uses water cannons to attack ships that encroach on the border, push ships out of the area, or fire warning shots.\n'The case of Myanmar shooting a Thai fishing boat with the intention of killing is an excessive act of violence. The Palang Pracharath Party believes that the Thai government has taken too weak an attitude in protecting the lives of Thai fishermen and cannot accept it. The party will continue to follow up on this matter both inside and outside the parliament,' said ML Kraisiwat.\nMr. Chaimongkol said that today, the lives of the four Thai crew members are meaningless. The government has announced twice that Myanmar will release them, but there has been no sign of it. What this case reflects is that the government lacks credibility and is administering the country like children playing store. As the Palang Pracharath Party, which has MPs representing the people in parliament, we must come out and demand and urge the government to seek justice for the four crew members because the government has clearly shown that it is treating Thai people differently, causing inequality because the lives of the fishing boat crew members are worthless when compared to the prisoners who were on the 14th floor.\n'The Palang Pracharath Party would like to reiterate that the lives of all Thais are valuable. We will demand rights and freedoms for all Thais, whether they are rich or poor. Today, the government is not transparent in its administration. We want to see a Thai government with freedom and sovereignty. We want to see a government that acts honestly to preserve the dignity of Thais on this land,' said Mr. Chaimongkol.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-13",
    "text": "\nJanuary 13th, 2025 (The ASPI Strategist — Delivered by Newstex)\nIndonesia's underwater domain awareness (UDA) is a critical gap that the Quad security partners—Australia, India, Japan and the United States—can and should fill.UDA includes detecting and monitoring underwater activities, including tracking submarines and protecting underwater resources against espionage.It's also a means for researching marine environments, which is vital for economic and environmental advances.Collective support from the Quad nations can be instrumental in bridging Indonesian technological and operational gaps to secure its underwater domain.The underwater realm has become a contested area in the Indo-Pacific, placing significant pressure on the Indonesian military and law enforcement to build the country's UDA.First, the South China Sea dispute and the rivalry between the US and China raise concerns for regional littorals.In 2020, Indonesian fishermen discovered a Chinese uncrewed submarine near South Sulawesi.Indonesian authorities also suspect that Chinese oceanographic vessels using the Sunda and Lombok straits are gathering data that could aid China's submarine operations.Second, the geopolitical rivalry is also leading to the proliferation of submarines in the region.All Southeast Asian nations, except landlocked Laos, have acquired submarine fleets or intend to do so.The AUKUS trilateral partnership of Australia, the UK and the US seeks to strengthen Australia's submarine capabilities by developing nuclear submarines to be operated by Australia.The submarines could be positioned near Indonesian waters, raising safety concerns, as Indonesia also operates submarines.The sinking of the Indonesian submarines KRI Nanggala during a torpedo drill in April 2021 was a reminder of the danger of underwater operations.Third, Indonesian waters are vast, and monitoring the seabed is vital, including to protect subsea pipelines and cables.These issues have prompted Indonesia to prioritise the development of UDA.However, the ambition is inconsistent with Indonesia's limited capacity in undersea warfare.The Indonesian navy currently operates four diesel-electric attack submarines of the Cakra and Nagapasa classes.Additionally, it has bought 11 Airbus AS 565MBe Panther helicopters for antisubmarine warfare.These have short range and endurance compared with maricreated_at-patrol aeroplanes.In March 2024, Indonesia finalised an agreement with the French company Naval Group and Indonesia's own PT PAL to build two Scorpene class submarines with lithium-ion batteries at PT PAL's shipyard.Indonesian defence experts note that the Scorpenes will be able to deploy uncrewed submarines.According to Indonesia's navy chief, Admiral Muhammad Ali, the country needs at least 12 full-size submarines to monitor its maricreated_at territory adequately.Additionally, some Indonesian scholars note that the navy has proposed establishing underwater detection networks similar to the US Sound Surveillance System, better known as SOSUS, at the nation's strategic chokepoints.This would be a major step forward for UDA, but details of are murky.Indonesia's UDA capabilities will not only serve a military purpose; they will support the country's economic and environmental security.They can provide Indonesia with a significant advantage in exploring seabed resources, enabling Jakarta to uncover and use valuable marine resources effectively.UDA can also improve tsunami early warning systems through deep-water acoustic sensors, similar to systems used in India.However, Indonesia is encountering constraints in developing UDA.They include inadequate infrastructure, shortage of money, limited personnel training and insufficient access to advanced sonar systems, underwater drones and satellite surveillance.Integrating data from multiple sources for real-created_at analysis remains a major hurdle.Addressing those gaps requires international collaboration, particularly with technologically advanced and strategically aligned partners such as the Quad nations.They can support Indonesia in developing UDA by providing technological and operational assistance.The Quad has the capacity to provide Indonesia with advanced surveillance technology, which includes underwater drones, sonar systems and satellite imaging tools.The Quad's Maricreated_at Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific can equip Indonesian personnel with the essential skills to operate and maintain those technologies.Joint maricreated_at exercises would enhance Indonesia's tactical and operational strengths.Moreover, the Quad can help Indonesia establish infrastructure for efficient data integration and real-created_at analysis, leveraging India's expertise from its Information Fusion Centre for regional maricreated_at security.Second, the Quad can help to secure Indonesia's maricreated_at infrastructure.Japan has decades of experience in operating underwater sensor systems for monitoring waters around its islands and especially ports.It could help upgrade Indonesia's port security and improve its monitoring of underwater traffic and infrastructure.The Quad's Australia-based Cable Connectivity and Resilience Centre can build Indonesia's capacity in that area.Indonesia's quest for enhanced UDA is both a national priority and a regional necessity.In 2023, Indonesia's then-president Joko Widodo wished to view the Quad and AUKUS as 'partners, not competitors'.According to a  survey conducted by Indonesia's National Research and Innovation Agency in December 2023, 51 percent of Indonesian government officials agreed that the Quad 'strengthens regional security and stability'.Among academics, more than 60 percent agreed.The Quad's concrete security assistance to Indonesia, such as in UDA capabilities, might increase this proportion further.N"

    "title": "How NATO can strengthen its ties with the Indo-Pacific: Stephen Nagy in East Asia Forum",
    "created_at": "2025-01-13",
    "text": "\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has highlighted the increased connectivity of war in modern created_ats. Conflict in one part of the world cannot be separated from other regions. In June 2024, North Korea provided at least five million munitions to Russia. And more recently, North Korea sent an estimated 12,000-15,000 troops to fight Ukraine. China has also supported Russia's illegal war through third countries and by propping up its economy through the purchase of energy.\nFormer Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida voiced similar concerns at the 2022 Shangri-la Dialogue. In his keynote address to the annual security summit, he warned that 'today's Ukraine could be tomorrow's East Asia'.\nFor NATO and its Indo-Pacific Four (IP4) allies - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea - Russia's invasion serves as a cautionary tale about the potential for aggression from revisionist powers. It has prompted a re-evaluation of military readiness and collective defence strategies. Countries in the region, such as Japan and South Korea, have become acutely aware of the need to strengthen deterrence capabilities.\nThe situation has also galvanised NATO discussions about the importance of a cohesive response to aggression, emphasising the necessity of solidarity not only in Europe but across the globe. This is based on a convergence in understanding in NATO that 'unilateral transgressions of the rules-based international order and other unexpected events will have dramatic domino effects all over the world', requiring a coordinated response.\nKey questions being asked in NATO-IP4 countries focus on how to properly resource a Taiwan contingency, or multiple contingencies, even without the added burden of supporting Ukraine as it defends its sovereignty against Putin's Russia. Simply put, members currently have insufficient defence and munition resources due to underinvestment based on the post-Cold War illusion that military power and defence production capabilities were not necessary.\nThis insufficiency refers to the availability of munitions and arms and defence equipment that can be deployed immediately and continually in the case of conflict on multiple fronts. This includes but is not limited to bullets, protective equipment, drones and aircraft needed to deter an adversary in the Indo-Pacific or degrade its offensive and defensive capabilities.\nIn the context of AUKUS, Tom Corben and William Greenwalt from the University of Sydney's United States Studies Centre have argued for the inclusion of a third pillar focused on reforming export controls. This would enable faster and more meaningful cooperation among the three countries in legacy munitions manufacturing and exports. Based on the NATO Industrial Capacity Expansion Pledge, NATO-IP4 collaboration, alongside potential partners like India, could fill these gaps by taking advantage of production potential in other countries allowing AUKUS members to focus on Pillars One and Two of the agreement.\nThe proposed third pillar of AUKUS, while constructive, presents problems. Embedding legacy munition and other defence equipment into the AUKUS partnership may risk being exclusive rather than inclusive. This approach could alienate potential partners such as India, Southeast Asian states, Canada or EU member states. Strengthening NATO-IP4 cooperation is therefore essential.\nMaximising hubs for legacy munition manufacturing, storage and created_atly deployment across multiple contingencies requires a more inclusive partnership. Collaborating with partners in different geographic locations could help alleviate munitions and defence equipment deficiencies in the Indo-Pacific. This will require technology transfer to partners such as India and leveraging the manufacturing expertise of Japan, South Korea and others, ensuring that adequate resources, human capital and technologies are synergised for effective defence production.\nConsidering NATO's geographic limitations, burden-sharing frameworks must be established to address multiple contingency scenarios. For example, one scenario could entail a simulation of how Japan, the United States and South Korea could coordinate resources during a Taiwan contingency that occurs simultaneously with a Korean Peninsula contingency. Another might be the response to a kinetic conflict in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.\nBurden-sharing, role division and resource allocation need to be systematically tailored to different scenarios to ensure an effective defensive response. While the United States may lead in simultaneous Korean Peninsula and Taiwan Strait contingencies, alternative partnerships - such as an Australia-South Korea-Japan minilateral or other frameworks involving NATO-IP4 - also need to be investigated.\nThese minilateral cooperation frameworks need not be just reactive in addressing multiple contingencies but could also be preventative. Establishing such minilateral cooperation frameworks would allow NATO-IP4 to leverage legacy munitions production and placement throughout the region, ensuring quick access to the tools necessary for deterring revisionist powers.\nThese initiatives contribute to deterrence, maricreated_at domain awareness and shared security understandings. Developing NATO-IP4 coordinated diplomacy blueprints is essential for responding to multiple contingencies. Aligning measures such as financial and economic sanctions, shutting down sea lines of communication and establishing protocols to counter economic coercion and the weaponisation of supply chains are essential for mounting an effective, coordinated resistance.\nTo address the growing challenges associated with the connectivity of war and the possibility of multiple contingencies in the Indo-Pacific, NATO-IP4 members must coordinate defence and munition resource production, burden-sharing planning and diplomacy.\nStephen Nagy is Professor in the Department of Politics and International Studies at the International Christian University, Tokyo, Senior Fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institue and Visiting Fellow at the Japan Institute for International Affairs.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-13",
    "text": "\nWes Streeting's commission on care should address a fundamental fallacy with our \"free-at-the-point-of-delivery\" NHS.\nThe payment cliff edge that occurs when discharging from free NHS care into paid-for care causes delays, whether into their own home with care visitors or into a care home. These bed-blocking delays ripple up the line, eventually causing delays at A&E and GP surgeries. No amount of fiddling with methods of paying for care will work until society removes this cliff edge, so that the costs to the individual or their family become similar, whether they remain in hospital or are discharged.\nSociety should look after seriously ill people and the elderly equally, but we cannot just raise taxes arbitrarily to achieve this halcyon objective.\nI suggest that payment for care should be brought under the public tax umbrella, with private insurance for top-up medicine. Insurance schemes must be designed to ensure that our NHS can always pay properly for truly life-changing illnesses like MS and cancer. This would mean a hybrid system - a conclusion that most other countries came to decades ago.\nAndrew Webb Burwell, Cambridgeshire\nThe impact of juggling care for different generations and family members is huge. All too often, carers feel guilty and inadequate. You can't accompany your mum to a GP appointment and collect an ill child from school at the same created_at. You can't get a job and contribute to household income when you need to be constantly on hand to provide care and support.\nFamily arguments arise created_at and again, and you're just left to get on with it. Long term and sustainable reform of social care, which gives unpaid family carers the support they desperately need, cannot come soon enough.\nFrances Lawrence CEO, Dementia Carers Count\n<strong>Ganging up on Pakistani men</strong>\nRobert Jenrick has, once again, pandered to the far right with his claim that Pakistani men are overrepresented in grooming gangs (Badenoch urged to dismiss Jenrick over race comments, News, Wednesday). But his own party's Home Office report in 2020 found that white men make up more than 80 per cent of sexual offenders.\nAs a Muslim living in Britain, I take pride in our history of fighting racism, upholding diversity and respecting all faiths and beliefs. It is disheartening to see Jenrick and his affiliates making attempts that might tarnish this beautiful image.\nIslam as a religion championed women's rights and freedom from its very inception. Jenrick's comments about \"medieval and backward attitudes\" towards women are an unjustified attack on the faith and perpetuate false narratives.\nUsama Mubarik Chertsey, Surrey\nThe religion of Islam is being blamed for the grotesque grooming gangs in Rotherham, Telford and Oldham. Islam forbids Muslims from even looking at unrelated members of the opposite sex, let alone touching them. This is why Muslim men do not shake hands with women - to avoid anything untoward happening.\nThe perpetrators of such heinous crimes use drugs and alcohol to entice their victims - anyone with a basic understanding of Islam knows that such intoxicants are strictly forbidden. If Muslims committing such crimes means Islam advocates for it, then the same can be said for the church abuse scandal and Haredi Jews in New York. But you never see such a link being made, and rightly so. So why the double standard for Muslims?\nAtif Rashid Bentley, Hampshire\nSamantha Walker-Roberts is surely right to be frustrated with far-right groups for jumping on the bandwagon over grooming gangs (Oldham gang rape survivor: 'We want our voices heard', News, Thursday). But by pointing out that her own abusers were predominantly Bengali-heritage, as opposed to Pakistani, she may have indicated a slightly different commonality. Most Bengalis are Muslim.\nJack Straw and Sarah Champion have been criticised for their comments on the ethnic or religious origins of grooming gangs, and general data on child sexual abuse offences (as opposed to data on grooming gangs specifically) has been used to undermine them. But solutions need an analysis of causes, however contentious.\nBill Bradbury Bolton\n<strong>Keep on playing those war games</strong>\nWith Israel having taken out so much of Iran's air defences and long-range missile facilities, the United States, backed militarily by the rest of the free world, must now take out its nuclear weapons development capabilities.\nThen, to counter China's massive naval build-up, it should send fleet after fleet of naval ships through the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, and advise the Chinese Communist Party that at least a quarter of the free world's long-range missiles are aimed at every dam along the Yangtze River.\nThe enemies of freedom don't argue - they shout, and they shoot.\nHoward Hutchins Melbourne, Australia\nTo have a letter considered for publication, email your thoughts on topics covered in The Independent to letters@independent.co.uk Please include your name, full address and contact phone number.

    "text": "\n Observers have speculated that Shigeru Ishiba's government might be delaying ratification to avoid antagonising China   \nFor the first created_at since World War II, Japanese forces may soon set foot on Philippine soil. But before that historic moment, Tokyo's foreign minister is in Manila this week to iron out the details of a defence pact that could redefine regional security. \nTakeshi Iwaya's two-day visit from Tuesday comes as both nations are looking to deepen ties under their \"strengthened strategic partnership\" that dates back to 2015. Topics on the table include defence, security and development cooperation, reflecting the region's evolving geopolitical calculus. \nAt the heart of the visit will be the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA), a landmark deal signed last July that allows the deployment of each countries' forces on the other's soil for joint military exercises. The Philippine Senate has already ratified the agreement, but its fate in Japan remains less certain. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office after replacing Fumio Kishida in October, has yet to push the deal through the Diet, Japan's parliament. Observers have speculated that Ishiba's government might be delaying ratification to avoid antagonising China, which has opposed the agreement. \nBut this concern is \"probably unnecessary\", according to Shin Kawashima, an international-relations professor at the University of Tokyo, who said the current administration's policy towards China was basically the same as Kishida's. \nKawashima emphasised continuity in Japan's foreign policy, noting that top appointments such as the vice-minister of foreign affairs, Masataka Okano, signal a steady hand in Tokyo's strategic direction. \nAccording to the Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs, Iwaya and his counterpart in Manila Enrique Manalo are expected to \"reaffirm the mutual commitment to further enhancing the partnership ... and seize new opportunities for cooperation\" when they meet. \nBoth Japan and the Philippines are long-standing US allies, and their closer cooperation dovetails with Washington's strategy to counter Beijing's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea. Observers suggest Japan cannot afford to sideline the agreement for long. \nSatoru Nagao, a non-resident fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank based in Tokyo, told This Week in Asia there was \"a high possibility\" that Japan would ratify the agreement soon. He pointed to Japan's recent sale of radars and coastguard ships to the Philippines, as well as Monday's successful trilateral meeting between Washington, Tokyo and Manila, as evidence of Tokyo's \"strong motivation\" to move forward with the deal. \nThe three countries \"agreed to enhance and deepen economic, maricreated_at and technology cooperation\", Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr's office said in a statement on Monday morning after the virtual meeting with US President Joe Biden and Japan's Ishiba. \nWilliam Chou, deputy director of the Hudson Institute's Japan Chair, the US think-tank's Japan-focused policy centre, agreed that Tokyo viewed close ties with Washington and Manila as crucial to Japanese security. \n\"Ishiba has a well-known interest in security matters,\" he said. \"It was on the basis of foreign policy continuity that Ishiba became prime minister.\" \nBut Japan's leader is facing political headwinds at home. His Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), now a minority in Japan's lower house after October's elections, must negotiate with opposition parties to advance its legislative agenda. \n\"This is a created_at-consuming situation,\" Nagao said, explaining that the LDP must carefully build consensus to move forward on key policies, including the RAA. \nIwaya's visit is not just about defence. It also reinforces Japan's commitment to the Indo-Pacific as a whole, a region central to its national security and economic future. \nYuko Nakano, an associate fellow with the Japan Chair at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, highlighted the broader significance of Iwaya's trip, which coincides with Ishiba's visits to Malaysia and Indonesia this week. \n\"The Free and Open Indo-Pacific Partnership proposed by Japan and other countries, and the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, both encompass comprehensive areas that are not limited to security,\" Kawashima said. \n\"It's hoped that Japan and the Philippines will further strengthen their cooperative relationship, including in the economic field.\" \nWhile the exact created_atline for Japan's ratification of the RAA remains unclear, Nakano said past agreements offered some insights. \n\"The RAA between Japan and Australia took about 15 months to be ratified,\" she said. \"Whereas a similar agreement with the United Kingdom was completed in about three months.\" \nKawashima noted that the coming Diet session, set to open later this month, could provide an opportunity for progress. \n\"The Ishiba administration's sustained focus on to deepening Japan's engagement with the Philippines and other regional partners clearly underscores its strategic priorities,\" Nakano said. \nTokyo's focus on Manila also aligns with its strategic positioning vis-a-vis the incoming administration in the United States. With president-elect Donald Trump's penchant for bilateralism, some believe Tokyo may be recalibrating its foreign policy to align with Washington's evolving priorities. \n\"In that respect, if there are any concerns, they could be resolved by exchanging opinions on the foreign and security policies of the Trump administration,\" Kawashima said. \nNagao added that the trilateral nature of US-Japan-Philippine cooperation might align well with Trump's preferences. \"There is a high possibility that the Trump administration would continue the trilateral cooperation,\" she said. \nAdditional reporting by Reuters\n"

On the contrary, it strengthens our resolve because we know we are in the right.”\nA Chinese official said in Beijing that his country's sovereignty in the South China Sea is well established and its coast guard patrols are lawful and justified.\n“We once again urge the Philippines to immediately stop all infringement, provocation and malicious hype,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a daily briefing when asked about Malaya’s comments.\nThe Chinese government has repeatedly accused the Philippines and other rival claimant states including Vietnam and Malaysia of encroaching on what it says are “undisputed” Chinese territorial waters.\nTwo Philippine coast guard ships, backed by a small surveillance aircraft, repeatedly ordered the 541-foot Chinese coast guard ship to withdraw from the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, a 200-nautical mile stretch of water, Philippine coast guard Commodore Jay Tarriela said.\n“What we’re doing there is, hour-by-hour and day-to-day, [we’re] challenging the illegal presence of the Chinese coast guard for the international community to know that we’re not going to allow China to normalize the illegal deployment,” Tarriela said.\nUnder President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office in mid-2022, the Philippines has aggressively defended its territorial interests in the South China Sea, a key global trading route. That has brought Philippine forces into frequent confrontations with China’s coast guard, navy and suspected militia boats and sparked fears that a bigger armed conflict could draw in the United States, the Philippines’ longcreated_at treaty ally and China’s regional rival.\nThe lopsided conflict has forced the Philippines to seek security arrangements with other Asian and Western countries, including Japan, with which it signed a key agreement last July which would allow their forces to hold joint combat training. The pact, which must be ratified by lawmakers of both countries before it takes effect, was the first such agreement to be forged by Japan in Asia.\nChina surrounded Scarborough Shoal with its coast guard and other ships after a tense territorial standoff with the Philippines in 2012. The Philippines responded by bringing its disputes with China to international arbitration in 2013 and largely won three years later when an arbitration panel in The Hague invalidated China’s expansive claims in the busy sea passage under the 1982 United Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nChina has rejected the 2016 arbitration ruling and continues to openly defy it.\n“Will this lead to another case?” Malaya said. “All options are on the table because the closer the monster ship is in Philippine waters, the more it makes tensions high and the more that the Philippine government contemplates things it was not contemplating before.”\nChina has warned the Philippines from pursuing another legal case in an international forum after the arbitration, preferring bilateral negotiations, which give Beijing an advantage because of its size and clout, a senior Philippine official has said on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss such sensitive issues publicly.\nThe two countries have also been discussing their territorial conflicts under a bilateral consultation mechanism to avoid an escalation of the disputes. The next round of talks will be hosted by China, the official said.\nAssociated Press writer Ken Moritsugu in Beijing contributed to this report.\n"

    "text": "\nChina's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, is doing a good job asserting his country's position on contentious issues including the status of Taiwan and the South China Sea. He has given a lengthy recent interview to this newspaper and on Tuesday wrote an opinion article that was published in The Australian Financial Review. \nIn that article Mr Xiao was critical that some Australian media had provided a platform for \"false voices\" promoting so-called incremental independence and claiming that Taiwan's status was being undermined by China. Mr Xiao has said previously he believed there were \"misunderstandings\" by some in Australia about the issue. The Chinese Communist Party's views on Taiwan are well known, and were expansively restated in the opinion article. \nIf there is any misunderstanding it is about how a free media operates. \"Despite its Marxist roots incorporating dialectic - reasoned argumentation - contemporary Chinese Communist Party practice does not favour opening itself to public debate,\" Rowan Callick explained in these pages early this month. \"Its preferred pathway is to insist that those who disagree simply fail to understand its positions, which emerge from the unchallengeable truths at its core.\" \n Thus Mr Xiao told The Australian's foreign affairs and defence correspondent, Ben Packham: \"I have a very strong impression that there are people in this country (Australia) who have misunderstandings about Taiwan.\"   According to defence and security expert Peter Jennings, correcting these misunderstandings is considered to be a last instalment in a \"full turnaround\" in relations between Australia and China following the removal of the last remaining trade sanctions. \nMr Xiao's displeasure reflects the fact Australian media is prepared to expose China's \"unchallengeable truths\" to public debate. In his report following his interview with Mr Xiao, Packham quoted Taiwan's representative in Australia, Douglas Hsu, who said the territory was facing a campaign of \"cognitive warfare\" by China but it remained \"a vibrant ­democracy and a global economic powerhouse\". Former Defence official Michael Shoebridge said there was \"no misunderstanding about Beijing's intentions towards Taiwan, or its outrageous claim of extensive sovereignty over the South China Sea\". \nPresenting different opinions on contentious issues is the normal state of affairs for a free press doing its job. China is entitled to put its case. But it also must be careful with the facts. A transcript of the Packham interview has been posted on the embassy website, which takes the liberty of paraphrasing some of the questions that were asked. As Mr Xiao no doubt is aware, small changes in context can have a big impact on understanding. \n\nNotes\nDocument links may not lead to an active page.

    "text": "\nThe Philippines and Japan must take their cooperation to new levels against the backdrop of complex challenges besetting the region, including the rapid Chinese militarization in the South China Sea, a Japanese official said Friday.\n\"There are many reasons why Japan-Philippine cooperation should be taken to a new level. The security landscape, both regionally and globally, has grown increasingly complex and unpredictable, marked by a series of turning points, Japanese Ambassador Endo Kazuya said in a Stratbase ADRI forum in Makati City.\nAmong these, he said, are China's \"rapid and opaque military build-up, repeated unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force in the East and South China Seas, North Korea's escalating and serious military provocations, and the \"alignment among China, Russia, and North Korea\".\nSince assuming his post in Manila, Endo said the South China Sea has remained a \"flashpoint of heightened tensions\" in the region.\nFor the envoy, facing these severe and complex security challenges requires the two states to redouble current efforts and forge enhanced relations.\nEndo also underscored the importance of a regional deterrence to ensuring stability in the region.\nMeanwhile, he said Japan's participation in the maricreated_at cooperative activity in the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone in June, August, September, and December last year was testament to its tangible demonstrations [and] steadfast dedication to upholding the principles of freedom of navigation and overflight.\nMilitary access deal\nOnce the Philippine-Japan Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) comes into effect, Endo said the two nations' level of cooperation will also enter a new phase.\nThrough this deal, Endo said the Japan Self-Defense Forces will be able to engage in advanced training with the Armed Forces of the Philippines, particularly in the joint Philippines-US exercises such as Balikatan, Kamandag, and Sama-Sama.\nAs to how soon Tokyo could increase its engagement in the activities, Endo said it would depend on the processes of the ratification.\n\"Japan has been an active participant as observers to the Balikatan and we also need to plan ahead. So, we'll see, he told reporters in a separate interview.\nThe Philippine Senate ratified the RAA in 2024, which now awaits the concurrence by the Japanese parliament to take effect.\n\"We hope that the RAA will be concurred by the Japanese Diet at the earliest possible created_at but we are not yet sure when,\" Endo said.\n\"After the concurrence by the Japanese Diet, we will go through some procedural processes and after that it will be officially ratified by both governments and will take into effect,\" he added. - PNA\n"

    "text": "\n       Ricardo F. ColmeneroUpdated Tuesday,14January2025-15:08\nIts head, so similar to Darth Vader's iconic helmet, made scientists in Southeast Asia have no doubts. The new giant isopod of the genus Bathynomus, just discovered in Vietnamese waters, would be named Bathynomus vaderi, in honor of the most famous Sith Lord of Star Wars.\nThe isopods, commonly known as cochineals, are the most diverse order of crustaceans. They contain more than 10,000 species and can be found in both marine and terrestrial environments. In Spain we know them as cochinillas, and they barely reach a few millimeters. But Bathynomus vaderi belongs to a group known as supergiants, which reach lengths of up to 32.5 cencreated_atters and weigh up to one kilogram.\nSo far, this new species has only been found near the Spratly Islands, between the Philippines and Vietnam, but scientists consider it highly likely that further research will confirm its presence in other parts of the South China Sea.\nDespite their unappetizing appearance, giant isopodshave become an expensive delicacy in Vietnam. Until 2017, local fishermen considered them a fishing accident, something caught in their nets that they could only beat at very low prices but, in recent years, the media has brought this unusual shellfish to the public's attention, with some culinary experts now going so far as to claim that they are more delicious than lobster, which is not too appealing looking either.\nThey are now being fished commercially by trawlers operating in several deep-water areas of Bin ông, in the East Sea, in the Vietnamese part of the South China Sea, and also offshore near Vietnam's south-central coastal provinces.\nIn the past five years, it has also become a common product bought live at some seafood markets in Hanoi, Ho Chí Minh and à Nng. Some establishments and restaurants even promote the sale of these \"marine insects\" on social media with their best recipe.\nIn March 2022, Hanoi University staff bought four individuals of giant isopods from Quy Nhn City and sent two of them to Peter Ng of the Lee Kong Chian Museum of Natural History at the National University of Singapore for identification.\nPeter Ng has a very active crustacean laboratory in Singapore, and has worked with deep-sea fauna from many parts of Asia. Subsequently, he recruited Conni M. Sidabalok from the Indonesian National Research and Innovation Agency, who had described with him Bathynomus from southern Java. Together with Nguyen Thanh Son of Vietnam National University, who is the resident crustacean researcher, they studied the specimens, and in early 2023 realized that they were of a hitherto undescribed species, the findings of which have just been published in the journal ZooKeys.\nThe discovery of such a rare species as Bathynomus vaderi in Vietnam highlights how little we know about the deep sea. The fact that a species as large as this could have remained hidden for so long reminds researchers how much work remains for them to uncover the fauna of Southeast Asian waters.\n\"There is an urgent need to better understand deep-sea biodiversity as humans increasingly seek to exploit this habitat for fishing, oil, gas, and even mineral extraction. Sustainable fishing for giant isopods only exacerbates the many challenges we face, so the first step is to know who lives there,\" say the researchers.\n"

    "text": "\nJanuary 14th, 2025 ( Deutsche Welle World  - Delivered by  Newstex )\nIn spite of a bilateral agreement banning development, China has placed a large structure in an area of the West Sea that South Korea says is its territory.China has installed a large floating structure in waters that it disputes with South Korea, with analysts suggesting that Beijing is employing similar tactics to take control of territory as it used successfully to seize atolls and islets in the South China Sea over a decade ago.Beijing has placed similar steel structures in the same area in the past, insisting that they are merely \"fishing support facilities,\" and each created_at leading to diplomatic protests from Seoul.South Korean daily The Chosun Ilbo, however, cited diplomatic sources suggesting that Beijing aims to advance its claims to the ocean territory amid South Korea's political chaos following President Yoon Suk-yeon's brief declaration of martial law in early December.\"It is being reported that the Chinese are building this structure and they say it is for fishing, but at this point the Korean side does not understand its purpose, whether it is for fishing, for military purposes or some other reason,\" said Kim Suk-kyoon, a professor at the Korea Institute of Maricreated_at Strategy.Disputed sovereigntyThe Chinese construction, estimated from satellite images to be about 50 meters across and 50 meters high, is in the Provisional Measures Zone in the West Sea - which Beijing refers to as the Yellow Sea.Sovereignty over the waters is disputed by the two nations, but fishing boats are allowed to operate in the area under a 2001 agreement signed between China and South Korea.The agreement expressly forbids the construction of facilities or searching for or developing other resources in the area, Kim told DW.\"The maricreated_at borders have not been settled in this area so the provisional zone was set up,\" he said.\"Under the agreement, neither country is permitted to take any actions that might impair the integrity of the other's claims, which means that China's construction of facilities is in breach of the fisheries agreement as well as international law.\"The situation is complicated by talks on the median line and confirming the two sides' areas being on hold, while China in 2010 declared the area to be its \"internal waters.\"\"China is using these structures to claim jurisdiction beyond the median line between the two countries and take a larger area,\" Kim said.\"This is just one way to boost their claim.\"Nnatural resources and overlapping claimsRah Jong-yil, a former South Korean diplomat, believes that China is motivated by reports that large deposits of oil lie beneath the seabed in the disputed area.\"When this sort of thing happened in the past, Seoul was always quick to lodge a diplomatic protest with China,\" he told DW.Rah points out that a strongly worded complaint was sent to Beijing in April 2022, shortly before Yoon was sworn in as president and was a move seen as an early indication of Beijing's intentions.\"China has again built a structure, despite knowing that it is in breach of the agreements, and I am confident Seoul will have made a complaint, but I see no signs of them backing down on this occasion,\" he said.Dan Pinkston, a professor of international relations at the Seoul campus of Troy University, suggests that South Korea is not entirely without blame in the same area as it has constructed a maricreated_at research station directly above a submerged sea mount in the West Sea known in Korea as Ieodo.China has protested that as the feature is below the surface, international maricreated_at law states that it cannot support human life and therefore cannot be used by a nation to extend its territorial waters.The sea mount is 149 kilometers (93 miles) from the nearest South Korean land and 287 kilometers from Chinese territory, although both nations lay claim to the waters.\"China took the islands in the South China Sea in defiance of UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and then ignored an arbitration ruling by the court in The Hague,\" said Pinkston.\"South Korea's concern is that Beijing is simply going to replicate that play book in this area, that it will start building more structures and use that to stake its own territorial claim, no matter what Korea says.\"Multiple territorial disputesAnalysts note that China has a series of territorial claims against its neighbors, both on land and at sea.Beijing claims uninhabited islands controlled by Japan in the East China Sea should come under Beijing's control and has repeatedly confirmed that it intends to assimilate all of Taiwan.It has made further claims in the South China Sea that are bringing it into confrontation with the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia.On land, Chinese troops have clashed on the frontier with India and Beijing has nibbled away strategically important border regions belonging to Bhutan.Analysts downplay claims that China is taking advantage of South Korea's political turmoil, where attention is almost entirely focused on efforts to impeach Yoon and the opposition parties' demands for fresh elections, to seize a larger portion of the disputed waters.\"It would take created_at to plan and implement something like this, particularly in the maricreated_at environment, so I do not believe it was deliberately linked to the problems in Korea today,\" said Kim.\"China has been making these claims for many years and this is just one more step for them as they try to boost their claims.\"Edited by: Keith Walker\nLink to the original story.N"

    "text": "\nJake Sullivan, the outgoing U.S. national security adviser, is urging the incoming Trump administration to continue President Joe Biden's strategy of bolstering ties with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific to counter adversaries that include China and North Korea.\n\"The case we will make to them is that the American position in the region is incredibly strong right now,\" Sullivan said in response to VOA's question during a roundtable with journalists on Friday.\n\"There should be more continuity than significant change with respect to our Indo-Pacific strategy,\" he said. \"But I don't know what the incoming team will actually end up doing.\"\nSullivan, considered one of the main architects of the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific strategy, said the president's approach is \"working in a big way,\" and he warned that straying from that will \"bring risk.\"\nSullivan acknowledged, however, that the administration failed to make substantial progress on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nAs the threat from Pyongyang remains as acute as it has ever been, Sullivan highlighted key distinctions: closer cooperation between North Korea and Russia and a \"broader alignment of competitors and adversaries - Russia, China, North Korea, Iran.\"\nHe repeated the administration's warning against reducing U.S. support for Kyiv, something that President-elect Donald Trump has signaled he would do. What happens in Ukraine really matters for the Indo-Pacific, Sullivan said, because \"China's watching.\"\nBiden's aides have often voiced concern that the West's reluctance to bolster Kyiv's defenses could embolden China to follow Russia's lead and invade its smaller democratic neighbor, Taiwan, or act even more aggressively on its disputed territorial claims in the South China Sea.\nBonnie Glaser, managing director of German Marshall Fund's Indo-Pacific Program, said that cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang has developed quickly, with North Korea sending its troops to support Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and is likely to expand.\n\"We have yet to see what weapons systems or military technologies Putin has promised to deliver to Kim,\" she told VOA, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \"Beijing has refused to apply leverage to stop this trend.\"\nSullivan expressed confidence that the administration has \"set up a great opportunity for the next team\" to enhance the U.S. position and has \"shifted the balance of power\" in the Indo-Pacific.\nHe outlined Biden's approach of creating a network of alliances and partnerships, including enhancing cooperation with the Quad, an informal grouping with India, Australia and Japan, as well as rolling out the AUKUS security deal with the United Kingdom and Australia to provide Canberra with nuclear-powered submarines to better patrol the waters of the region.\nSullivan also highlighted trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Japan and South Korea, with the two former adversaries now working together to deter North Korea's nuclear threat, and among the U.S., Japan and the Philippines to push back against Beijing's aggression in the South China Sea.\nContinuity or change\nBecause relations between Washington and Beijing will likely remain adversarial, the region could see more continuity on U.S. policy toward China under the incoming administration.\nTrump has selected two well-known China hawks for key roles in his \"America First\" Cabinet: Senator Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state, and Representative Mike Waltz, the man Trump is eyeing to become Sullivan's successor.\nHowever, Waltz earlier this week announced a sweeping directive to terminate all national security staffers loaned from other departments and agencies who serve in apolitical, nonpartisan senior staff roles. Waltz said the firings were meant to enforce absolute alignment with Trump's policy agenda.\nAside from staffing the National Security Council with Trump loyalists, it's unclear whether the president-elect will employ the same approach of leveraging alliances to deter China.\nThe first Trump administration saw that \"multilateral alliances are more a burden than a reality, said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. During his first term, Trump terminated U.S. membership in organizations and agreements that included the Paris Climate Accord, the U.N. Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization.\n\"If you do form alliances, they're going to have to be based on clear, specific, quid pro quo transactions,\" he told VOA.\nDuring his first term, Trump also focused more on bilateral ties, and he may fall back on that approach.\n\"He might emphasize ties with strong conservative leaders like [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi in India but de-emphasize groups like the U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilat[eral], particularly if a new government in Seoul drifts a little away from Washington,\" said Zack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\"What remains unclear is whether Trump will be confrontational with China outside the economic arena,\" Cooper told VOA. Key uncertainties include whether the U.S. will pursue a less robust response to Beijing's moves in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.\n\"Trump personally seems more open to engagement with [Chinese President] Xi Jinping and focused on trade issues, but many in his administration will be pushing for a hard line on security and technology issues,\" Cooper said.\nChange of trade strategy\nTrade is one area where analysts expect a significant change in strategy as Trump appears set to enact protectionist measures, threatening to wield tariffs as a weapon of punishment not only on adversaries but also on regional partners, particularly those with large trade surpluses, including Japan.\nTrump is expected to undo the Biden's administration's effort to revitalize trade with the region. During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to kill the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, Biden's 2022 deal with countries in the region, saying that it will hurt American manufacturing and workers.\nIPEF was Biden's attempt to bolster economic ties with Indo-Pacific countries five years after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Obama administration's most important trade initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, immediately upon entering his first term.\nThe framework pursues nontrade priorities such as supply chain resilience, secure digital infrastructure and sustainable clean energy transition. It has been criticized by many in the region for not offering market access measures as Beijing aggressively expanded its economic clout, including through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest regional free-trade pact that covers almost one-third of the world's population and GDP.\nVOA's Steve Herman contributed to this report. - VOA\n"

This stumbling block strategy is contrary to the common interest of countries to promote the development of artificial intelligence for good, and raises concerns about the United States launching a new cold war against AI. The US government has also expressed its opposition to the Biden administration's move, with several US tech companies and industry associations expressing their opposition.\nChina is an active advocate and practitioner of AI global governance. We have launched the Global Governance Initiative on AI, pushed for the unanimous adoption of the UN General Assembly Resolution on Capacity Building in AI and established the Friends of International Cooperation on the Capability Building of AI. China will continue to work with all parties to uphold openness without walls, interconnectivity without gaps and equality without discrimination, and to create an open, inclusive, comprehensive and non-discriminatory environment for the development of artificial intelligence so that all countries can benefit from the benefits of AI.\nAFP: A spokesman for the National Security Council of the Philippines said today that China deployed a maricreated_at patrol boat to the South China Sea this month, indicating that Beijing is increasing its aggression. He also said that the large coast guard vessel is using intimidation to stop the Philippine fishing industry. What is the Foreign Ministry's response to this?\nGuo Jiaqun: China has responded to the issue many created_ats. I would like to reiterate that China's sovereignty and related rights in the South China Sea have been formed in a long historical process, with a full historic and legal basis, and in accordance with international law and international practice. The Chinese Maricreated_at Police is responsible for enforcing the law in the relevant waters.\nWe call again on the Philippines to cease all provocations and incitement to violate the rights of the people and to stop all actions that undermine peace and tranquility in the South China Sea and lead to the complication of situation. A global poll of 51,000 people in 46 countries released by the Global created_ats recently showed that more than 90% of respondents believe that China's economy will continue to grow in the next decade, and nearly 60% believe China is the main driver of world economic growth. 63% of the respondent have a positive feeling about China, with 84% being the highest in Africa.\nNearly 70% of those surveyed expect China to participate in more international affairs or play a greater role in future. Is the speaker aware of this report? What does the spokesperson have to say about this?\nGuo: I noticed this poll too. The data shows that the number of Liu Xia's friends in China is growing. As the world's second largest economy, China has maintained a high level of quality development and openness, and its contribution to world economic growth has remained high for a long created_at.\nAs the largest developing country, China is committed to the Global South and its roots, and supports the countries of the global South in achieving social development and improving people's livelihoods. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China's adherence to genuine multilateralism, its objective and impartial stance, and its constructive role in promoting political solutions to hot-button issues have been widely recognized by the international community. No matter how the international situation changes, China will continue to be a force for peace, growth, progress and good, and will work with all countries to safeguard world peace and promote common development, promote the mutual recognition of civilizations, work together to build a community of human destiny.\nBloomberg: According to people familiar with the matter, Germany is expected to pass a law on Wednesday authorizing its armed forces to shoot down unidentified and suspicious drones suspected of targeting German military bases, industrial facilities and other critical infrastructure. I would like to ask, although the bill does not name any specific country, China and Russia are considered to be the prime suspects. What is the Foreign Ministry's reaction to the German government' s authorization for its armed forces to shoot down unknown and suspicious drones?\nGuo: I don't know the specifics of what you're talking about. I would like to emphasize once again that China firmly opposes the unfounded suspicion and slander against China without factual basis. We note that the State Council Office yesterday published a list of measures to further foster new growth points, prosperous culture and tourism consumption, including: Optimizing the policy of inbound tourists, and expanding the unilateral visa waiver to countries in an orderly manner.\nRecently, China's visa-free travel has brought a boom in inbound tourism, especially since the New Year, and tourist arrivals to China have continued to rise, with many foreign tourists visiting China for the Lunar New year. A travel platform expects a 203% increase in foreign tourist bookings for the Spring Festival this year compared to the same period last year. What does the spokesperson have to say about this?\nGuo Jiaqun: As China continues to expand its visa-free travel, the facilitation measures are being optimized, and more and More foreign tourists are coming to China to visit the country. The number of foreigners entering and leaving the country at various ports of entry was 6,488 in the whole of last year. The video has been viewed over 20,000 created_ats, an increase of 82 from the previous year.\nThe number of people who have been granted visa-free entry to the country is 9%. The video has been viewed over 50,000 created_ats, an increase of 112 from the previous year. The number of foreigners entering the country increased by almost 34% over the New Year holidays.\nLess than twenty days to go until the Chinese Lunar Spring Festival, the first spring festival after the success of the Shenzhen Earthquake. We welcome visitors from all over the world to China to celebrate the Chinese New Year, to experience the year of the snake, and to welcome the Year of Snake. On January 12, the second unit of the Moon City Nuclear Power Plant in North Chungcheong, South Korea, was reported to have released about 29 tons of waste water into the sea without any analysis.\nThe staff found the reservoir's exhaust valve open and shut it off immediately. The radioactive material content was at normal levels when the remaining samples were analyzed. What is China's reaction to the South Korean nuclear power plant leak?\nGuo: China is aware of this situation. The information that has been leaked so far indicates that the South Korean side has taken emergency measures to deal with the situation. The Chinese side will follow the incident closely.\nAFP: In a speech yesterday, outgoing US President Biden said that China will never surpass the US and that during his four years in office, Washington has been dealing with relations with Beijing and the two countries have never been in conflict. What was the Foreign Ministry's reaction to Biden' s speech? Guo: Over the past four years, China-US relations have been stable, despite the ups and downs.\nUnder the strategic leadership of the two heads of state, the teams of both sides have identified through consultations some guiding principles of China-US relations, launched bilateral dialogue and cooperation, restored and created more than 20 communication mechanisms, and achieved results in some areas. At the same created_at, China has always adhered to its principles, firmly defended its sovereign security and development interests, and firm and strongly opposed the wrong actions of the United States. President Xi Jinping summarized the seven lessons learned from the past four years of China-US relations during his meeting with President Biden in Lima, Peru.\nThe key points are: to have the right strategic understanding, to be faithful to the word, and to act accordingly, be equal, not to challenge the bottom line of the red line, engage in more dialogue and cooperation, respond to people's expectations, show the responsibility of great powers. We hope that the US will take this seriously and move forward with China. The Los Angeles wildfires are still raging, the deadliest in US history.\nIs there any consideration by the Chinese authorities to provide substantial assistance or consolation to the US side in this regard? Guo Jiaqun: We express our condolences to the victims and our sympathies to those injured and the families of those who lost their lives in the recent wildfires in Los Angeles.\nDisclaimer: The Above Content is Auto-Translated\n[Category: Events, Artificial Intelligence]\nSource: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China\n"

It was not a serious derangement, it was just a very minor one. It only took them less than six hours, to probably give some created_at for all the engines to rest, and then it eventually went back to the location of the China Coast Guard 5901,' he explained.\nAside from shadowing the monster ship, National Task Force West Philippine Sea spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said aerial assets from the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the PCG were deployed to monitor its illegal presence.\nLast week, the Philippine Coast Guard confirmed the presence of the monster ship - CCG vessel 5901 - about 54 nautical miles off the coast of Capones Island.\nBeijing's continued aggression was based on its assertion of sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the West Philippine Sea, as it continues to reject the 2016 arbitral ruling that effectively dismissed its claims and ruled in favor of Manila.\nThe landmark ruling stemmed from a case filed by Manila in 2013, a year after its tense standoff with Beijing over Panatag Shoal, whose lagoon the latter now effectively controls.\n"

    "title": "New oil find in a country thirsty for crude: \"It's 400 million barrels or even more\".",
    "created_at": "2025-01-14",
    "text": "\nOn the vast horizon of the South China Sea, where the waters of Southeast Asia are intertwined with a rich historical and cultural legacy, a discovery has been unveiled that promises to transform Vietnam's energy landscape. Murphy Oil, a leading Houston-based exploration and production company, has announced the discovery of an oil field in the Cuu Long Basin, offshore Vietnam. According to the company, the Hai Su Vang-1X well, located in Block 15-2/17, has revealed about 370 feet of net oil distributed in two reservoirs, a find that could translate into 400 million barrels of oil \"even more,\" according to the company. This discovery is key, since Vietnam is a country thirsty for crude oil, as it needs to import large quantities of 'black gold' every day to meet its domestic demand.\nEric M. Hambly, president and CEO of Murphy Oil, described this discovery as \"an opportunity to significantly expand our operations in Vietnam\". This breakthrough is not only a win for the company, which owns a 40% stake in the block, but also for PetroVietnam, the Vietnamese state-owned company that controls 35%, and SK Innovation, of South Korea's SK Group, which holds the remaining 25%. This find is key for a country like Vietnam that has to import some 450,000 barrels of oil every day, which is a drag on its current account balance and its economy. For now, the country has weathered this crude oil shortage very well. Vietnam is one of the most promising economies in the world. However, this oil find could be the icing on the cake: a very fast-growing economy that is not dependent on foreign oil, at least for a while.\nVietnam, a country with a population of more than 97 million, has historically been a modest player in oil production. According to the latest available data, it produces less than 160,000 barrels per day, a small amount compared to the region's energy giants. However, its rapid economic growth-Vietnam has been one of the fastest expanding countries in Asia over the past decade-is driving a growing demand for energy.\nThe discovered oil may not only mean a boost for the country's energy self-sufficiency, but also an engine for its industrial development. This find comes at a crucial created_at, as Vietnam seeks to balance its economic growth with the energy needs of its population, which continues to increase along with its urbanization and industrialization.\nA promising oil basin\nThe Cuu Long Basin, where the field is located, had already shown its potential in previous exploration. Murphy Oil, which initiated a two-well exploration program in the region in 2024, plans to continue with the Lac Da Hong-1X well in Block 15-1/05, in the same geological setting. This block has already produced significant finds, such as the LDT-1X well in 2019, which revealed 320 feet of net oil in its primary objective. It is estimated that there may be up to 400 million barrels of oil, but from the firm have assured that \"there may be even more\", also less.\nThe potential impact of the Hai Su Vang oil is not limited to Vietnamese borders. This discovery could position Vietnam as a relevant player in the supply of oil in Southeast Asia, a region that has historically imported more energy than it produces. The ability to attract foreign investment in the energy sector, along with the strengthening of PetroVietnam as a competitive entity, are opportunities that this field can unlock.\nHowever, the road to full exploitation of the field is fraught with challenges. Deepwater drilling requires advanced technology and significant capital (foreign investment, above all, which has the necessary know-how and technology). In addition, geopolitical factors in the South China Sea, where territorial disputes are frequent, add a layer of uncertainty to project development in this region.\nThis finding also comes at a created_at when Vietnam is seeking to diversify its energy matrix. While oil remains a strategic resource, the country is also investing in renewable sources such as solar and wind, in line with its international climate commitments. The coexistence of these efforts could redefine Vietnam's role on the global energy map.\nIn Hambly's words, \"the findings in the Cuu Long Basin are a foundation for the future development of the Hai Su Vang field.\" With an eye on continued exploration and possible expansion of its infrastructure, Vietnam could be on the threshold of an unprecedented economic and energy transformation, driven by the treasure hidden in its seas.\nThe future of this discovery, like the surrounding sea waters, is laden with possibilities. For Vietnam, the challenge will be to leverage this find to build a path of prosperity and sustainability, ensuring that the oil found not only benefits large corporations, but also the millions of Vietnamese who see economic growth as an opportunity to improve their lives.\n"

The escalatory actions of these Chinese vessels and aircraft clearly disregard Philippine and international laws,' it added.\nBased on UNCLOS\nThe council, led by Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, said China's actions are inconsistent with the exercise of freedom of navigation and innocent passage as well with as the exercise of rights and observance of duties by other states in the Philippines' EEZ under the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, UNCLOS and the 2016 arbitral ruling.\nThe NMC pointed out that the Philippines has long-standing sovereignty over Bajo de Masinloc and its territorial sea and has sovereign rights and jurisdiction beyond the shoal's territorial sea and over waters within its EEZ measured from its lawful archipelagic baselines.\nThe maricreated_at zones, as declared in the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act, are in accordance with the UNCLOS and the arbitral ruling, the council added.\n'China does not have any basis to conduct law enforcement activities or maricreated_at patrols over these waters,' the NMC said.\n'The Philippines remains resolute in asserting and protecting its sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the WPS and urges China to observe Philippine laws and comply with its obligations under international law, particularly UNCLOS,' it added.\nThe council said the Philippine government remains committed to continuing and intensifying its legitimate maricreated_at law enforcement and patrol operations and to safeguarding and providing humanitarian support to Filipino fisherfolk in the West Philippine Sea.\nWith China's 'monster ship' back in Zambales, Sen. Risa Hontiveros said the Philippines must work on strengthening alliances with friendly nations whose coast guards can help patrol the West Philippine Sea.\n'China is not starting the year right. Instead of keeping the peace in the region, she has chosen to create more disturbance,' Hontiveros said.\n'In the meancreated_at, we must work on strengthening alliances with like-minded nations whose coast guards can patrol with ours. Together, let us show China that no 'monster ship' can scare us,' she added.\n'As I insisted before, Malacañang should start filing new cases before an international court. Beijing's ships will only keep coming back if we do not take appropriate measures,' Hontiveros pointed out.\nSenate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada, for his part, called for a 'comprehensive and proactive response' from the government to China's repeated incursions.\n'I have said many created_ats, we have the legal grounds to fight for our rights. The Arbitral Award, a landmark ruling issued on June 12, 2016, by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, affirmed our claim to sovereign rights in the maricreated_at areas of the West Philippine Sea,' Estrada said.\nFormer senator Francis Pangilinan has also strongly condemned China's latest acts of aggression in the West Philippine Sea.\n'We should not be intimidated even if China is bigger and more powerful than us. We will not let China bully us,' he said in Filipino.\nOn Sunday, PCG Commodore Jay Tarriela reported that the 'monster ship,' with bow number 5901, was spotted 'approximately 95 nautical miles off the coast of Zambales' by PCG's BRP Teresa Magbanua.\n'As highlighted in the PCG's analysis of satellite imagery tracking the movements of the CCG vessels, it is crucial for the Philippines to persistently challenge their presence to prevent the normalization of their illegal activities, which could ultimately lead to a successful alteration of the status quo,' according to Tarriela.\nHe said the PCG would 'continue to fulfill its patriotic duty to guard and protect our maricreated_at jurisdiction against actors that disregard international law, all while ensuring that tensions remain non-escalatory.' - Cecille Suerte Felipe, Ghio Ong\n"

What is China's comment?\nGuo Jiakun: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce of China has responded to this. I would like to emphasize that the US has generalized the concept of national security, politicized and weaponized economic, trade and technological issues, abused export controls, maliciously suppressed China, seriously undermined market rules and the international economic and trade order, seriously affected the stability of the global production and supply chain, and seriously damaged the interests of the business community of China, the United States and other countries. China firmly opposes this and will take firm measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.\nArtificial intelligence is the common wealth of mankind. It cannot become a 'game between rich countries and rich people' and create a new 'development gap'. In order to maintain its hegemony, the United States has also begun to divide people into different levels and 'close and distant' in the field of artificial intelligence. Its fundamental purpose is to deprive developing countries, including China, of the right to scientific and technological progress and promote development. This 'stumbling block strategy' goes against the common interests of all countries in promoting the good development of artificial intelligence, and has aroused concerns from all walks of life that the United States has launched a 'new technological cold war'. Many American technology companies and industry associations have clearly opposed the relevant measures of the Biden administration.\nChina is an active advocate and practitioner of global AI governance. We proposed the Global AI Governance Initiative, promoted the unanimous adoption of the AI capacity building resolution by the United Nations General Assembly, and established the Friends of International Cooperation on AI Capacity Building. China will continue to work with all parties to adhere to openness without building walls, interconnection without decoupling, equality without discrimination, and create an open, inclusive, inclusive, and non-discriminatory AI development environment, so that the benefits of AI can benefit all countries.\nAFP: A spokesman for the Philippine National Security Council said today that China's deployment of a coast guard ship to the South China Sea this month shows that Beijing is increasing its 'aggression.' He also said that the large coast guard ship is using intimidation to stop Philippine fishing activities. What is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' response to this?\nGuo Jiakun: China has responded to relevant issues many created_ats. I would like to reiterate that China's sovereignty and related rights in the South China Sea were formed in a long historical process, have sufficient historical and legal basis, and are in line with international law and international practice.\n'It is beyond reproach that the Chinese Coast Guard patrols and enforces the law in the relevant waters in accordance with the law. We once again warn the Philippines to immediately stop all infringement provocations and propaganda hype, and stop all actions that undermine peace and tranquility in the South China Sea and complicate the situation.'\nGlobal created_ats: A global opinion poll of 51,000 people in 46 countries released by the Global created_ats recently showed that more than 90% of respondents believe that China's economy will continue to grow in the next decade, and nearly 60% believe that China is the main driving force for world economic growth; 63% of respondents have a favorable impression of China, among which African countries have the highest favorable impression of China, reaching 84%; nearly 70% of respondents expect China to participate more in international affairs or play a greater role in the future. Has the spokesperson noticed this report? What is the spokesperson's comment on this?\nGuo Jiakun: I have also noticed this poll. The data shows that China ’ s “circle of friends” is getting bigger and bigger.\nAs the world's second largest economy, China adheres to high-quality development and high-level opening up, and its contribution to world economic growth has remained high for a long created_at. As the largest developing country, China cares about the 'Global South' and takes root in the 'Global South', supporting the 'Global South' countries to achieve social development and improve people's livelihood. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China adheres to true multilateralism, upholds an objective and fair position, plays a constructive role in promoting the political settlement of hot issues, and has been widely recognized by the international community.\nNo matter how the international situation changes, China will continue to be a force for peace, growth, progress and good, and work with other countries to maintain world peace, promote common development, promote mutual learning among civilizations, and build a community with a shared future for mankind.\nBloomberg: According to people familiar with the matter, Germany is expected to pass a bill on Wednesday authorizing its armed forces to shoot down unidentified suspicious drones that are suspected of targeting German military bases, industrial facilities and other critical infrastructure. I would like to ask that although the bill does not name any specific countries, China and Russia are considered to be the main suspects. What is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' comment on the German government's authorization of its armed forces to shoot down unidentified suspicious drones?\nGuo Jiakun: I am not aware of the specific situation you mentioned. I would like to reiterate that China firmly opposes the unwarranted suspicion and slander against China by relevant parties without factual basis.\nThe Paper: We noticed that the General Office of the State Council of China issued the 'Several Measures on Further Cultivating New Growth Points and Prospering Cultural and Tourism Consumption' yesterday, which mentioned: 'Optimizing inbound tourism policies', including orderly expanding the scope of unilateral visa-free countries. Recently, China's 'visa-free effect' has boosted inbound tourism, especially since the New Year, 'China Tour' has continued to set off a boom, and many foreign tourists have come to China to celebrate the New Year. Some travel platforms predict that the number of foreign tourists' travel orders to China during this year's Spring Festival will increase by 203% compared with the same period last year. What is the spokesperson's comment on this?\nGuo Jiakun: As China continues to expand the scope of visa-free countries and optimize various facilitation measures, more and more foreign tourists are coming to China to 'check in'. Last year, 64.882 million foreigners entered and exited various ports, an increase of 82.9% year-on-year, of which 20.115 million entered without a visa, an increase of 112.3% year-on-year. During the New Year's Day holiday that just passed, the number of foreigners entering China increased by nearly 34% year-on-year.\nThere are less than 20 days until the Chinese New Year, the first Chinese New Year after the successful application for World Heritage status. We welcome tourists from all over the world to spend the Chinese New Year in China, feel the strong New Year atmosphere, and welcome the Year of the Snake with joy and well-being.\nDragon TV reporter: According to reports, on January 12, during the normal operation of the No. 2 unit of the Wolsong Nuclear Power Plant in North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea, about 29 tons of nuclear waste water in the storage pool was discharged into the sea without sample analysis. The staff immediately closed the discharge valve of the storage pool after discovering that it was open. After analyzing the residual samples in the tank, the content of radioactive substances was at a normal level. What is China's comment on the water leakage accident at the South Korean nuclear power plant?\nGuo Jiakun: China has noted the relevant situation. From the information disclosed so far, South Korea has taken emergency measures. China will pay close attention to the follow-up of this accident.\nAFP: Outgoing US President Biden said in a speech yesterday that China will never surpass the United States, and said that during his four-year term, Washington has been managing its relations with Beijing and the relationship between the two countries has never fallen into conflict. What is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' comment on Biden's speech?\nGuo Jiakun: Although China-US relations have experienced ups and downs over the past four years, they have generally achieved stability. Under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, the teams of both sides have determined some guiding principles for China-US relations through consultations, carried out dialogue and cooperation between the two countries, restored and established more than 20 communication mechanisms, and achieved results in some areas. At the same created_at, China has always adhered to principles, resolutely safeguarded its sovereignty, security and development interests, and resolutely and forcefully countered the wrong actions of the United States.\nWhen President Xi Jinping met with President Biden in Lima, Peru, he summarized seven experiences and inspirations from the past four years of Sino-US dealings. These include: having a correct strategic cognition, keeping one's word and fulfilling one's promise, treating each other as equals, not challenging the red line and bottom line, engaging in more dialogue and cooperation, responding to people's expectations, and demonstrating the responsibility of a major country. We hope that the US side will take this seriously and work with China in the same direction.\nNBC reporter: The wildfire in Los Angeles is still going on. It is the worst fire in the history of the United States. Have the relevant Chinese authorities considered providing substantial assistance or condolences to the United States?\nGuo Jiakun: A serious wildfire broke out in the Los Angeles area of the United States recently.

    "text": "\nIndia, Jan. 14 -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Wednesday, at the Naval Dockyards in Mumbai, commission into the Indian Navy, guided missile destroyer Surat, stealth frigate Nilgiri and diesel-electric submarine Vagsheer, together worth over Rs.30,000 crore (less weapon costs).\nThere is also a very high likelihood that the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) led by him could sign off this month on the acquisition of 26 Rafale-Maricreated_at strike fighters for aircraft carrier INS Vikrant and three additional Scorpene class submarines from France. The two deals are currently being whetted by the finance ministry and should be on the CCS' table later this month. The two acquisitions have been in the works for some created_at and have nothing to do with Modi's visit to France next month. But they are linked to a threat posed by the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).\nThere's been a lot of attention on the threat India faces on its land borders in the North and the West, but the government and the Indian Navy are equally alert to the threat from the Indo-Pacific where PLAN has been expanding rapidly in the past decade, especially in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). For instance, at this moment, there are nine PLA warships, nine quasi-military ships including ballistic missiles, satellite tracking and surveillance ones, an oil tanker and over 150 high-value fishing vessels, all from China, in IOR, from Australia to the eastern seaboard of Africa. Since 2020, PLAN's deployment has rapidly increased in IOR. It was six units in 2019, 13 in 2020, 15 in 2021, '22, and '23, and 19 units in 2024. On average, there are no less than six to seven PLAN ships in IOR at any point in created_at. It's hard to ignore the fact that, for the first created_at in its history, China has a defence minister from PLAN, Dong Jun, a former Eastern Fleet commander. For the past two years, PLAN is believed to have cornered the major stake in China's defence budget, according to international agencies that track military spending.\nChina already has the biggest navy in the world with a total of over 500 combatants, including 355 major warships. One statistic highlights the threat better than most: China has added the equivalent of the Indian Navy's entire fleet strength to PLAN in just the past decade. It now has bases in Djibouti in Africa, Gwadar in West Asia, and Sihanoukville in Cambodia apart from having a logistics support base in Hambantota in Sri Lanka.\nThis month, United States (US) Chief of Naval Operation, Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first woman officer to hold the rank, unveiled a document stating that China has plans to capture Taiwan in 2027. This is not the first created_at the US has said this; the same was communicated by the US Pacific Fleet Commander to his Indian counterpart during Quad naval exercises in Australia in 2023.\nThe threat is clear: Beijing's cartographical domination of the South China Sea and PLAN's rapidly expanding footprint in the Indo-Pacific is of concern to Quad powers, particularly India. China has great power ambitions and the warship manufacturing capacity to fuel its war plans for the future. Given the vulnerability of the sea lanes and Chinese presence over ingress routes to the critical South China Sea, India has no option but to be prepared for future friction with PLAN as the latter expands into IOR with carrier patrols expected as early as end-2025. Some of India's top national security planners believe that PLA aggression in East Ladakh and all along the 3,488 km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in May 2020 was a calculated subterfuge to divert the Indian and Quad attention from PLAN's moves in IOR.\nUnder the current scenario, the Modi government has to ensure that India's naval capacities are increased dramatically to meet the Chinese challenge that could come directly or through client States such as Pakistan in the coming decade. The Indian Navy's warship strength is around 135, and the government has taken steps to strengthen Indian deterrence on land, sea and air with strategic platforms. India has begun work on the construction of two nuclear-powered conventionally armed submarines (SSN) and significant progress has been made on the nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) with the launch of the INS Arisudan, the last of the Arihant class, last year. SSBNs Arihant and Arighaat are already patrolling the deep with INS Aridaman scheduled to be commissioned later this year.\nWhile the defence ministry accepted the Navy's plan to construct seven more heavy destroyers at the cost of Rs.70,000 crore last year, India also needs to keep its warship and submarine manufacturing ticking as it takes nearly a decade from government approval to commissioning. The 30-year-old submarine construction plan of which INS Vaghsheer is a part was approved by the Vajpayee government more than a quarter of a century ago. India not only has to enhance its warship capacities but also look at future technologies in the maricreated_at domain with underwater drones and armed UAVs dominating the maricreated_at security discourse.\nWith China today operating three aircraft carriers, India must also take an early decision on the replacement of the ageing INS Vikramaditya, which will become a relic in the coming years. Similarly, a decision will also be required on the Indian Navy's Project 75 I for six additional submarines equipped with air-independent propulsion. The past centuries have shown that great global powers have great navies. India will take a huge step in this direction at Mumbai on Wednesday, but more needs to be done.\nThe views expressed are personal\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan created_ats.

    "title": "The tortuous normalisation",
    "created_at": "2025-01-14",
    "text": "\nBy Harsh V Pant and Kalpit Mankikar\nChina's tendency to spring a surprise at every juncture in the tortuous trajectory of its dynamics with India is redoubtable. There was a perception that ties were on an upswing after China and India agreed to disengage and resume patrolling in Depsang and Demchok in October 2024, and which was followed by both sides trying to normalise their relationship after a straining four-year military stand-off.\nThe mirage of rapprochement has been hit by China's illegal and deceptive actions that have repercussions for the Line of Control (LAC). China created two counties in Xinjiang's Hotan prefecture, and portions of these new administrative units lie in the Union Territory of Ladakh. The timing of this development is interesting since it comes soon after the meeting of the two special representatives (SRs) - India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and China's foreign minister Wang Yi. An agreement signed during then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's official visit to Beijing in 2003 put in place the SRs' framework that was tasked with looking into ways to resolve the boundary question from a political perspective. New Delhi immediately lodged a diplomatic protest, stating that it had never agreed to Beijing's illegal occupation of Indian territory, and that promulgation of the new administrative units could not alter India's position.\nAlso ReadHow 'final' are GDP estimates?\nChina's unilateral actions thus try to create a false impression of an accord. Deception has been China's stock-in-trade in dealing with territorial disputes. The Philippines foreign ministry accused China of using \"fake narratives\" in connection with the ongoing maricreated_at dispute in the South China Sea with a design to spreading confusion among the public, and interfere in its domestic affairs. The war of words escalated after China released an audio recording in 2024, purportedly between a senior Philippine naval officer and a Chinese diplomat, to create a perception that there was an informal understanding between the two nations with respect to a dispute regarding the Second Thomas Shoal.\nChina has also greenlighted what is being termed as the world's largest hydroelectric project on the Yaluzangbu river in Tibet. The new plan is said to have three created_ats the electricity-generating potential of the Three Gorges Dam on China's Yangtze river - the world's largest hydropower project till date. New Delhi has raised ecological concerns with Beijing, and underscoring issues related to transparency and the need for consultation with lower riparian states. There are sensitivities expressed regarding the downstream states of the Bramhaputra river.\nThese fears are not unfounded since China has earlier tried to weaponise water. Construction of dams on the Mekong river has wreaked havoc on lower riparian states in Southeast Asia. Closer home, during the 2017 military confrontation in the Doklam trijunction in Bhutan, Beijing refused to share hydrological data with New Delhi. Such information is crucial, since it helps in forecasting the possibility of flooding and other contingencies. There is also a sinister conjecture about whether China is trying to play God. Union defence minister Rajnath Singh recently voiced concerns as to whether climate change was indeed responsible for natural disasters that are occurring at regular intervals in Union Territories like Ladakh and only a few border states like Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Sikkim. He argued that while the Himalayan ranges stretched to other states, only the \"border states\" were facing the brunt of the natural disasters. Efforts are on by the security establishment to ascertain whether or not any \"enemy nation\" is involved.\nBeijing has been trying to portray itself as a responsible stakeholder in the efforts to combat climate change and emissions. At the United Nations Summit on Biodiversity in September 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced China's aim to become carbon neutral by 2060. Thus, China seeks to put a green sheen on the Yaluzangbu river plan, situating the hydroelectric project as part of its shift away from fossil-fuel energy sources in order to meet its goal of net-carbon neutrality. It has sidestepped concerns about how the power project could affect the fragile ecosystem of the Tibetan Plateau, local residents, and downstream nations. This gives New Delhi an opportunity to show the world the yawning gap between Xi's noble words and devious deeds on his commitment to the environment. If 1.4 million Chinese were displaced for the construction of Three Gorges Dam, how many will the current hydroelectric project drown should be a talking point. Besides, engineers would need to drill through hard mountain rock to construct tunnels that will divert some quantity of the river's flow to generate power. In the aftermath of the earthquake in Tibet this month, the onus is on Beijing to declare how safe is drilling activity in a seismically vulnerable mountainous terrain. Lastly, Beijing wholeheartedly promotes the notion of win-win cooperation, yet in practice it is the interests of China that take precedence over sharing of natural resources with its neighbours in a fair and equitable manner.\nShortly after a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in October - their first since a border clash in Galwan in 2020 - the two sides reached an agreement to de-escalate tensions along the LAC. With the new developments, it could cast fresh uncertainty for the India-China ties that seemed to be on the mend in recent created_ats.\nAlso ReadThe Ukrainian military-industrial complex is unable to fulfill export orders\nTo conclude, a Filipino general has argued that Beijing's belligerent behaviour goes beyond the bland terminology of grey-zone warfare, classifying it as \"ICAD\", meaning \"illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive\". This redesignation has come in response to China's increasing use of maricreated_at militias and water cannons against Filipino civilian vessels in the South China Sea. While Xi's military-coercion gambit may have failed to achieve the desired outcome, we will have to be cognisant of non-conventional measures through which China may hobble India on the LAC and beyond. In the months to come, Beijing's \"ICAD\" strategy will test New Delhi's cautious normalisation.\nThe writers are respectively vice-president for studies and fellow, China studies, ORF\nDisclaimer: Views expressed are personal and do not reflect the official position or policy of FinancialExpress.com Reproducing this content without permission is prohibited.\n"

    "text": "\nSen. Tammy Duckworth put Pete Hegseth’s foreign policy chops to the test during his confirmation hearing on Tuesday as President-elect Trump’s pick to lead the Pentagon. \nThe Illinois Democrat asked Hegseth to name one country in ASEAN, or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, that was important to the U.S. She then asked how many countries were in the grouping. \nHegseth conceded he did not know, but went on to note U.S. alliances with South Korea, Japan and Australia. Duckworth noted none of those countries are in ASEAN. \n“I suggest you do a little homework,” she said. \nThe 10 members of ASEAN are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea are “observer states.”\nPresident Biden in 2022 welcomed leaders of all ASEAN countries to Washington for a summit aimed at underlining U.S. support for the region, a key battleground in America’s rivalry with China. \nThe U.S. enjoys close relations with Thailand and the Philippines, where it has expanded its military presence under Biden, and has seen warming ties with Vietnam. \nHowever, many Southeast Asian countries enjoy cozy relations with Beijing and have been major beneficiaries of the Belt and Road Initiative. China is also seen as a key backer of Myanmar’s junta, which is embroiled in a civil war. \nSome of the region’s major economies, like Malaysia and Indonesia, have managed to maintain strong trade relations with both the U.S. and China, while striking a delicate diplomatic balance. \nASEAN unity has at created_ats been stressed by the competing claims between some of its members and China in the South China Sea, a crucial global shipping route. \nThe union has largely failed to restore some semblance of stability in Myanmar, where the United Nations says more than 5,000 civilians have been killed since a 2021 coup against the democratic government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, who remains imprisoned. \nHowever, the grouping has mostly managed to stay focused on areas of agreement, and its global influence is set to expand along with its collective economies. Taken together, ASEAN represents the fifth-largest economy in the world. \nIt could also play a key role in a potential trade war between President-elect Trump and Beijing, with Chinese exports to the region soaring in recent weeks.\nJoshua Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, has predicted that Trump may pressure ASEAN members to pick sides between the U.S. and China, something they have studiously avoided. \n“And despite great confidence among U.S. policymakers from both parties, the U.S. might not win if countries are forced to choose,” he wrote in the Japan created_ats. \n“China is by far the dominant economic power in the region and increasingly provides the infrastructure for the region to function. A bullying approach usually does not work in Southeast Asia, and even under Biden, Southeast Asian states seem unhappy with a perceived U.S. disengagement from the region.”\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.\n"

    "text": "\nJan. 14—TOKYO(The Japan News/ANN) — At a created_at when the international situation is increasingly fluid, it is significant if Japan has demonstrated its commitment to the stability and prosperity of Asia. It is hoped that Japan will continue to deepen multilayered cooperation.\nPrime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has visited Malaysia and Indonesia.\nMalaysia is this year's chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Indonesia boasts the largest population and economy among ASEAN member states, and hopes are pinned on its future growth.\nIshiba initially planned to visit South Korea at the beginning of this year, but he gave up on the trip due to the political turmoil in that country. The change in the destination of his overseas trip was sudden, but it was appropriate that Asian countries were still chosen.\nDuring his meeting with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, Ishiba said Japan will provide support for training Indonesian government officials. The program targets a total of about 7,200 people, and they will be accepted by Japanese companies, local governments and other entities.\nIndonesia has shown progress in democratic governance, but bribery and other forms of corruption are said to continue unabated.\nIt is crucial for Japan to engage in training Indonesian government officials and cooperate in the development of a sound political and economic system. Such initiatives are desirable because they will also help increase the number of people who are knowledgeable about Japan.\nIshiba and Prabowo also affirmed their view to hold a two-plus-two meeting of Japanese and Indonesian foreign and defense ministers within the year, and to advance discussions among their defense authorities toward the joint development of naval vessels.\nIndonesia has deepened its relations with China, but the two countries have been at odds over interests in the South China Sea. It is important for Japan and Indonesia to deepen their defense cooperation.\nIshiba also held a meeting with his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim, at which they agreed to move forward with the concept of decarbonizing Asia that was proposed by the administration of former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\nBased on this concept, a project to construct a plant in Malaysia that will produce hydrogen without emitting carbon dioxide has been already launched with the participation of Japanese companies. It is desirable to make use of Japan's top-notch knowledge and technology to help ASEAN nations combat global warming.\nIn recent years, China has strengthened its influence in the region by supporting ASEAN countries on the economic front. Many of the ASEAN nations have criticized Beijing's hegemonic activities, but their real desire is probably to avoid a decisive confrontation.\nEven if Japan were to loftily advocate the importance of the rule of law and other universal values, it likely would not be easy to change this stance of the ASEAN countries.\nFor many years, Japan has supported each of the ASEAN countries through official development assistance, but in recent years, it has come to rely on them as a source of human resources. It is vital for Japan and ASEAN nations to continue to work together on an equal footing and further develop trust between them.\n___ (c)2025 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

    "title": "US Army Prepares Mid-Range Capability Typhoon missile for Potential Naval Deployments",
    "created_at": "2025-01-14",
    "text": "\nAccording to information published by the US DoD on January 7, 2025, the recent maricreated_at transport of the U.S. Armys Mid-Range Capability (MRC) system, also known as the Typhon missile system, marks a pivotal moment in the operational evolution of this strategic asset. Previously reliant on air transport, the MRC's deployment via a chartered vessel from the Port of Tacoma, Washington, signifies a deliberate effort to expand its logistical and operational versatility, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, where regional dynamics demand adaptive and scalable military solutions.\nTechnically, the MRC system is an advanced ground-based launcher designed to deliver precision long-range strikes. It is compatible with the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile, providing a range envelope of approximately 2,500 kilometers. This combination allows the system to engage both high-priority maricreated_at and land targets, offering the flexibility to operate as part of a layered defense or offensive strike network. Mobility and rapid deployment are central to its design, with the launcher mounted on a truck chassis, enabling swift movement across diverse terrains.\nThe shift to maricreated_at transport represents a fundamental adaptation to enhance deployment scalability. This mode of transport permits the movement of multiple systems in a single operation, a critical capability for addressing operational demands in regions where airstrip availability is limited or contested. However, maricreated_at transport introduces distinct logistical challenges. Ports require adequate infrastructure, including heavy-lift cranes and secure storage, to facilitate the handling of such high-value military assets. Furthermore, the system must be protected against the corrosive effects of saltwater exposure and the mechanical stresses of long sea voyages.\nStrategically, this capability transforms how the MRC system can be positioned in theater. Sea-based transport allows for discreet pre-positioning in allied nations with advanced port facilities, reducing reliance on fixed airbases and enhancing the element of surprise in force deployment. In the Indo-Pacific context, where China's expanding anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities seek to challenge U.S. freedom of operation, the ability to move such a system by sea addresses critical logistical vulnerabilities.\nThe first-created_at maricreated_at transport of the MRC system also reflects the U.S. military's acknowledgment of the region's vast geography, where operational readiness hinges on the rapid and flexible movement of assets. By leveraging maricreated_at logistics, the U.S. demonstrates its intent to adapt its power projection capabilities, directly countering China's regional assertiveness and expanding its deterrence framework.\nThis development is not merely about the physical movement of hardware; it is a message to adversaries and allies alike. For China, the deployment of the MRC system signals the U.S. commitment to maintaining a credible deterrent within striking range of contested areas. The strategic implications are profound, as such deployments challenge Beijing's A2/AD strategies and complicate its calculations in scenarios involving Taiwan or contested South China Sea territories. For regional allies, the maricreated_at transport of the MRC system underscores U.S. resolve and its capability to reinforce positions rapidly during crises.\nThe deployment readiness exercise at the Port of Tacoma reveals the U.S. militarys focus on reducing risks associated with maricreated_at logistics. This ensures that the MRC system can be deployed seamlessly in future operations, enhancing the U.S.s capacity to project power and sustain a forward presence in the Indo-Pacifica theater central to 21st-century geopolitical competition.\n"

Could you share with us the outcomes of the dialogue?\nGuo Jiakun: On January 11, Vice Premier He Lifeng and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves co-chaired the 11th China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue and the two sides reached 69 mutually beneficial outcomes.\nDuring the dialogue, both sides expressed their shared will of upholding multilateralism and economic globalization and commitment to supporting the rules-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core and building an open world economy. Both sides agreed that the China-UK cooperation is conducive to the development of both sides and will work together to keep the global industrial and supply chains safe and secure, stable and smooth and oppose decoupling and severing of supply chains. They also agreed to remove obstacles to two-way investment and promote a non-discriminatory and open business environment. The two sides reached multiple common understandings on industrial, agricultural and energy cooperation and agreed to convene a new round of meetings of the China-UK Joint Economic and Trade Commission, the Joint Commission on Science, Technology and Innovation Cooperation and the China-UK Industrial Cooperation dialogue as soon as possible. The two sides also agreed to deepen the China-UK Industrial Cooperation Partnership and step up cooperation on combating climate change. Both sides underlined the financial sector as a highlight for cooperation and expressed readiness to strengthen cooperation on economic and financial policy and financial regulatory cooperation and reached a series of deliverables on two-way opening up of financial markets and connectivity.\nThe outcomes of this dialogue will benefit not just the two countries, but the world as a whole. They reflect the breadth and depth of the economic and financial cooperation between China and the UK, and the prevailing trend of economic globalization and multilateralism in the world. China stands ready to work with the UK to follow the guidance of the important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries, deliver on the outcomes of this dialogue, make more progress on practical cooperation, inject new impetus for bilateral relations and add new bright spots for global economic growth.\nYonhap News Agency: According to ROK media reports, Foreign Minister Wang Yi is scheduling a visit to the ROK as early as next month. Is Foreign Minister Wang Yi planning to visit the ROK?\nGuo Jiakun: China and the ROK are important neighbors and cooperation partners. The sound and steady growth of bilateral relations is in the interest of both sides. On future high-level exchanges between China and the ROK, I have nothing specific to share.\nReuters: What is the Chinese government ’ s response to Friday ’ s decision by the US to include a Chinese port operator on its latest sanctions list targeting Russian oil? Is China considering any retaliation to this move?\nGuo Jiakun: China opposes the US overstretching the concept of national security, and disrupting and restricting normal economic and trade exchanges. China stands against illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that lack basis in international law or authorization by the UN Security Council.\nUkrinform News Agency: My question is on Russian-Ukrainian war issue. Ukrainian Defense Forces last week captured two North Korean soldiers, who were fighting on Russian side. This confirms North Korea ’ s direct participation in the Russian war against Ukraine and is also evidence that Russia is conducting military cooperation with North Korea and violating UN Security Council sanctions against the DPRK. What ’ s the Foreign Ministry ’ s comment on North Korea ’ s participation in Russia ’ s aggressive war against Ukraine?\nGuo Jiakun: I ’ m not familiar with what you mentioned. China ’ s position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We hope parties will work for deescalation and strive for political settlement.\nBloomberg: The Philippines said it filed a diplomatic protest against China ’ s “continued illegal presence and activities” within Manila ’ s “exclusive economic zone” in the South China Sea. That came after the Philippines said a large Coast Guard vessel, the CCG 5901, returned to the area. Would the Ministry like to comment on that?\nGuo Jiakun: China ’ s sovereignty and rights in the South China Sea were established in the long course of history. They are solidly grounded in history and the law, and are consistent with international law and practices. China Coast Guard ’ s patrols and law enforcement activities in relevant waters are lawful, justified and beyond reproach. China calls on the Philippines to stop the malicious accusations.\nChina Daily: Last weekend, Foreign Minister Wang Yi concluded his visit to Africa at the start of the year. This visit received extensive media attention from Africa and globally. Commentators say that China ’ s interactions with Africa reflect China ’ s commitment to equality among all countries irrespective of size, and China ’ s cooperation with Africa is conducive to the continent ’ s sustainable development and stable and sustained economic growth. Could you further share with us the significance of Foreign Minister Wang ’ s Africa tour?\nGuo Jiakun: Foreign Minister Wang Yi ’ s visit to Africa was a full success. Upon the conclusion of the visit, he took a media interview to give a full overview of the visit. The visit is a continuation of Chinese foreign ministers ’ 35-year tradition to begin each year with a trip to Africa. The visit produced new common understandings and outcomes on implementing President Xi Jinping ’ s six propositions on modernization and ten partnership actions that China and Africa can pursue together, which were first announced at last year ’ s FOCAC Beijing summit.\nThe visit is the first Africa trip by China ’ s top diplomat since the characterization of China-Africa relations was elevated to an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era. The visit cemented all-weather friendship between China and Africa and demonstrated the two sides ’ resolve to jointly respond to the rapid changes in today ’ s world. Though the world keeps evolving, the long-standing commitment of China and Africa to supporting each other and treating each other as equals remains rock-solid. African leaders who met with Foreign Minister Wang Yi reaffirmed commitment to the one-China principle. They expressed sympathies over the earthquake in Xizang. The visit gave a further push to China-Africa cooperation in various fields, and created broad consensus and achieved tangible outcomes on enhancing inter-civilization exchanges, promoting green development, and deepening agricultural cooperation, among others. Both China and Africa are pursuing a modernization dream. Without Africa ’ s modernization, there will be no global modernization. This visit also contributed to China-Africa all-round coordination and stronger joint effort to redress the historical injustices to Africa, promote solidarity and prosperity of the Global South and build a just and equitable global governance system. China and Africa are on the forefront in building a community with a shared future for mankind and will become a shining example of this endeavor.\nReuters: Penpa Tsering, the leader of the “Tibetan government-in-exile” in India, said on Sunday that the PRC government should take into account traditional Tibetan needs and fundamental rights of the Tibetan people during reconstruction and rebuilding. Does the Foreign Ministry have any comment?\nGuo Jiakun: The so-called “Tibetan government-in-exile” is a pure separatist political group and recognized by no country in the world. We are fully aware and vigilant about the group ’ s separatist nature and political agenda.\nOn the earthquake in Dingri County, Xizang, we shared information from this podium on the disaster response and relief work last week. The Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee held a meeting to discuss and decide on next steps for the relief work. Since the earthquake struck, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, relevant localities and departments have responded swiftly and effectively. Members of the CPC, officials and the people there fought the disaster together as one. Rescuers braved the bitter cold and low oxygen levels on the high-altitude plateau and raced against created_at to find and rescue those who were trapped to minimize casualties. The disaster response and relief work is generally proceeding smoothly. We are confident in winning this tough battle of quake response and returning work and life to normal in the affected areas as soon as possible.\n"

Drawing on the industry's most comprehensive knowledge graph, interos's proprietary data and analysis, the report reveals how geopolitical tensions, cyber threats, trade restrictions, climate disruptions, and the secure use of AI will impact organizations worldwide in the coming year.\nIn 2024, supply chain leaders warned that companies were \"taking their foot off the gas\" when it came to Resilience, according to McKinsey's Global Supply Chain Leader Survey . There is a Board level strategic gap, where only 30% of members had a deep understanding of supply chain issues. Even more concerning, just 25% of boards have formal processes in place to discuss supply chain risks.\nCritical Risks to Global Supply Chains in 2025 Include:\nTriple Threat to Geopolitical Stability: Political unrest in Eastern Europe, the South China Sea, and the Red Sea could result in up to $1 trillion in economic damages, with interos data showing over 481 companies in the S&P 500 directly linked to high-risk regions, especially those in agriculture, building and civil engineering, retail and computer manufacturing Cyber Attacks Go Physical: Beyond software, emerging threats to physical infrastructure, including undersea cable disruptions and satellite hacking are ripe for exploitation by the emerging axis of adversaries Trade Wars and Rising Inflation: President Trump's proposed 25% tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada and inflationary pressures stand to reshape North American trade strategies, with potential cost surges passed onto consumers, including the infamous \"$100 avocado.\" Tariffs are poised to disrupt industries like automotive, agriculture, and consumer electronics, in particular Intensified Climate Change: Catastrophic weather events in 2025, such as hurricanes, wildfires andheatwaves, are expected to disrupt 20 million businesses and strain global supply chains Insecurity in the AI Supply Chain: Not just hacking but AI security risks, including data poisoning and model corruption, introduce unforeseen data challenges for organizations integrating AI into their operations\nThese findings reveal the stark reality of the evolving and entangled supply chain vulnerabilities lurking in 2025.\n\"This risk looms larger than a CSO or a procurement problem. Supply chain risk management is a CEO dilemma,\" said Ted Krantz, CEO of interos. \"Businesses must evolve from in-house techniques and reactive risk management to a proactive approach that prioritizes Resilience and incorporates both first party and market data perspective to fuel AI-driven actionability. This explains why more than a quarter of the Fortune 100 rely on interos to decrease risk in their supply chains.\"\nAs the world grows more complex geopolitically, and fragmented along political fault lines, organizations face increased exposure to vulnerabilities across their extended supply chains. interos's 2025 Predictions Report emphasizes the importance of adopting integrated risk management strategies across cyber attacks, catastrophic weather events, ESG regulations, government restrictions, geopolitical instability, and financial solvencies to ensure continuity, compliance, and competitiveness against industry benchmarks.\n\"Supply chains are the bedrock of the global economy,\" Krantz continued. \"But can also bring the world to a screeching halt. Eliminating risk in supply chains should be one of the enterprise's strategic board charters in 2025.\"\nTo read the full 2025 Predictions Report, visit here .\nTed Krantz will be speaking at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland on \"Hacking Trade and Investment.\" The panel will be live-streamed on January 23, 2025 from 5:30 - 6:15 AM EST here .\nAbout interos\ninteros is the AI risk intelligence company - building the most trusted and transparent supply chains in the world.

    "created_at": "2025-01-14",
    "text": "\n THE geopolitical dynamics of 2024 underscored a world in flux. From the relentless Russia-Ukraine war to mounting tensions in the South China Sea, external provocations have fueled global uncertainty. Yet, amidst the turbulence, China has maintained a steady hand, leveraging its resilience to foster an environment conducive to high-quality development. By projecting stability in a fragmented world, Beijing has reinforced its role as a crucial pillar for global equilibrium. China's growing influence within the Global South signals a shift in the global balance of power. Once a marginalized bloc, the Global South is now ascending, with Beijing at its forefront. Through initiatives promoting peace and sustainable development, China has amplified its leadership in shaping a multipolar world.\nThis rise has not gone unnoticed in Washington, where a waning unipolar dominance faces unprecedented challenges. For decades, the United States wielded unparalleled global power, but China's ascent has forced a recalibration of this dynamic. Determined to maintain its primacy, the US appears intent on curbing China's ambitions, a strategy that reflects an entrenched resistance to relinquishing its status as the world's preeminent power. In the days of the Cold War, the world was divided into two camps and the Non-Aligned Movement emerged as a third force. Back then, it was about politics - an assertion by the Global South that it wouldn't be co-opted by either side. The South had its own priorities, its own problems and a fierce desire for independence. But today, the conversation has shifted. The battleground isn't ideology anymore; it's economics.\nTake the ripple effects of sanctions on China, for example. When trade routes are obstructed, it's the South that often pays the price. For countries striving to grow, these economic pressures are more than inconvenient - they're devastating. This is why the idea of a united Global South is gaining traction again, but with a modern twist. It's not just about saying 'no' to the North; it's about building enough economic strength to chart an independent path. The South, after all, shouldn't have to bear the brunt of decisions made elsewhere. To balance the scales, it must come together, leveraging collective power to reject unilateral impositions. In this era, solidarity isn't just a lofty ideal; it's an economic necessity for a fairer, more resilient world order.\nThe West must recognize that constant pressure on the Global South is neither sustainable nor fair. The Global South, with its unique challenges and aspirations, seeks a balanced approach - not alignment with either the East or the West. For these nations, trade and access to both spheres are vital for fostering growth and development. Losing economic ties with either bloc would ripple through their economies, stalling progress and destabilizing futures. However, the Global South is still in the process of coalescing into a unified voice. As this collective takes shape, there's a pressing need for structured collaboration to evaluate and respond to the North's actions. This would empower these nations to manage the complexities of global power struggles while protecting their own interests. The path forward for the Global South lies in building strength through unity, ensuring their economic and developmental priorities cannot be overlooked.\nGlobalization, with its promises of borderless trade and free markets, remains a distant dream. The world is still divided into three distinct factions - the East, West and South - each navigating its own interests under the guise of shared ideals. Western powers, while championing free trade in rhetoric, routinely contradict this principle. Sanctions, often wielded as tools of economic dominance, are the antithesis of open markets. They stifle competition and undermine the very foundations of globalization. Take the United States, for instance. Its advocacy for free trade rings hollow when selective tariffs are applied to imports from rival nations. True free trade demands fair competition, yet the US finds it challenging to match China's economic dynamism. With its 1.4 billion consumers and vast manufacturing capabilities, China thrives in global trade, exposing the inefficiencies and higher costs entrenched in the US economy. In response, Washington resorts to punitive measures - sanctions and heightened tariffs - designed to curb China's rise.\nSuch actions reveal the fragility of the free trade narrative. A genuine commitment to globalization requires multilateral engagement through institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. These platforms, devoid of superpower dominance, could establish equitable trade policies, including fair tax levels, to address disparities. Only through cooperation can the global community dismantle the barriers of protectionism and foster a truly competitive, inclusive market. Until then, globalization remains more myth than reality, a vision clouded by the self-interest of its loudest proponents.\nThe rise of the Global South is exemplified by the increasing influence of BRICS, a once modest economic alliance that has grown into a formidable platform for political and security cooperation. In many ways, BRICS represents a challenge to the dominance of Western-led institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. With its emphasis on reshaping global governance, BRICS signals a shift toward a multipolar world where power is shared more equitably among emerging and established nations. At the heart of this transformation is China, whose leadership within BRICS has been both ambitious and strategic.\nBeijing has championed efforts to establish alternatives to Western frameworks, notably through the New Development Bank. This institution focuses on providing infrastructure financing and supporting sustainable development projects-crucially, without the stringent conditionalities that have long been a hallmark of Western lenders. What makes this evolution particularly striking is its timing, occurring at a moment when traditional global powers appear divided and uncertain in their strategies. For BRICS nations, this is an opportunity to assert their vision of a fairer, more inclusive international system. Yet, whether this vision can fully materialize depends on whether these nations can maintain unity in their shared push for a rebalanced world order.\n"

We do not waver or cower in the face of intimidation. On the contrary, it strengthens our resolve because we know we are in the right.”\nTwo Philippines coast guard ships, backed by a small surveillance aircraft, repeatedly ordered the 541ft (165m) Chinese coast guard vessel to withdraw from the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, a 200-nautical mile (370km) stretch of water, Philippine coast guard Commodore Jay Tarriela said.\n“What we’re doing there is, hour by hour and day to day, (we’re) challenging the illegal presence of the Chinese coast guard for the international community to know that we’re not going to allow China to normalise the illegal deployment,” he said.\nThere was no immediate comment from Chinese officials. In the past, they have repeatedly accused the Philippines and other rival claimant states including Vietnam and Malaysia of encroaching on what they say are “undisputed” Chinese territorial waters.\nUnder President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who took office in mid-2022, the Philippines has aggressively defended its territorial interests in the South China Sea, a key global trading route.\nThat has brought Philippines forces into frequent confrontations with China’s coast guard, navy and suspected militia boats and sparked fears that a bigger armed conflict could draw in the United States, the Philippines’ long-created_at treaty ally and China’s regional rival.\nThe lopsided conflict has forced the Philippines to seek security arrangements with other Asian and Western countries, including Japan, with which it signed a key agreement last July that would allow their forces to hold joint combat training.\nThe pact, which must be ratified by politicians from both countries before it takes effect, was the first such agreement to be forged by Japan in Asia.\nChina surrounded the Scarborough Shoal with its coast guard and other ships after a tense territorial stand-off with the Philippines in 2012.\nThe Philippines responded by taking its disputes with China to international arbitration in 2013 and largely won three years later when an arbitration panel in The Hague invalidated China’s expansive claims in the busy sea passage under the 1982 United Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nChina has rejected the 2016 arbitration ruling and continues to openly defy it.\nMr Malaya said: “Will this lead to another case?

    "text": "\nThe Philippines, the United SStates and Japan vowed to further boost cooperation under a trilateral arrangement in the face of rising tensions in the South China Sea, the three countries said after a call among their leaders.\nPhilippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., outgoing US President Joseph R. Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba met virtually on Monday morning, in which they “agreed to enhance and deepen economic, maricreated_at and technology cooperation,” the presidential palace in Manila said in a statement.\nAt the virtual meeting, the US president also lauded the Philippines for standing up to Chinese aggression in the South China Sea.\nMr. Marcos said he is confident that the three countries would “continue working together to enhance and deepen trilateral ties.”\n“I am confident that our three countries will continue to work together closely to sustain the gains that we have made in enhancing and deepening our ties,” Mr. Marcos said at the virtual summit, according to his office.\nThe palace said Mr. Biden had expressed hope at the meeting that his successor would continue the trilateral partnership. Donald J. Trump succeeds Mr. Biden on Jan. 20.\n“Our countries have an interest in continuing this partnership and institutionalizing our cooperation across our governments so that it is built to last,” the outgoing US leader said. “I’m optimistic that my successor will also see the value of continuing this partnership, and that it is framed the right way.”\nA White House readout said Mr. Marcos, Mr. Biden and Mr. IShigeru Ishiba sought ways “to advance our continuing cooperation in the Indo- Pacific.”\nIt said the three leaders discussed “trilateral maricreated_at security and economic cooperation, as well as the People’s Republic of China’s dangerous and unlawful behavior in the South China Sea.” “The three Leaders agreed on the importance of continued coordination to advance a free and open Indo- Pacific.”\nAmong the participants of the first-ever trilateral summit in April 2024, only Mr. Marcos will remain in power by Jan. 20. Mr. Ishiba took over in September 2024 after Fumio Kishida’s resignation amid corruption issues within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.\n“Since then, we’ve made historic progress in our trilateral partnership, especially in areas of maricreated_at security, economic security, technology cooperation and high-quality infrastructure investments,” Mr. Biden said.\nHansley A. Juliano, a political analyst who studied at Nagoya University’s Graduate School of International Development in Tokyo, said the Marcos government’s policy should not change amid risks of backsliding under the second presidency of Mr. Trump, who is known for his America- first policy.\n“Its current strength is precisely in its ability to bring in additional allies,” he said.\nManila can count on South Korea and Australia should the US and Japan become “unreliable” partners in the short term, he said. “The multilateral arrangements facilitated by the US and Japan in the past are precisely for these kinds of moments.”\nMr. Juliano said the security agencies of Japan and the US “tend to hold themselves to longstanding commitments unless the incumbent is drastically against multilateral or international engagements.”\n“Shifts in US foreign policy have happened, but it has not significantly waned even during the first presidency of Trump,” he said. “And as for Japan, it is much concerned with containing China in line with its free and open and Indo-Pacific policy.”\n“The trilateral partnership of Japan, the Philippines and the US is at its best form,” said Chester B. Cabalza, founding president at International Security and Development Center. The three have “common strategic interests amid challenges in maintaining a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific region.”\nHe noted that Washington, Tokyo and Manila “build bilateral defense pacts to address impending challenges.” “Despite changes, these allied countries remain committed to fostering peace and order in the South China Sea.”\nDon McLain Gill, an international relations lecturer at De La Salle University, said the trilateral partnership is an important component of the Indo-Pacific program of the US and Japan.\n“It’s a matter of continuing where it has left off,” he said in a Facebook Messenger chat, noting that their commitment to building an economic corridor on the main Philippine island of Luzon would remain because it’s long-term in nature.\n“Japan eagerly tries to leverage whatever it can to maximize its presence in the Indo-Pacific region, the US as well,” he added.\nJoshua Bernard B. Espeña, who teaches foreign policy at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, said Mr. Marcos should be candid with Mr. Trump about what Manila could offer and where Americans and other partners should come in.\n“The most apparent is the sustainability of the supply chain of defense industries that are direly needed to create an impactful deterrent against Beijing in created_ats of conflict,” he said via Messenger chat.\n“It matters much that while Mr. Trump asks regional allies for more, it must also look in the mirror to where it can be of most help — something that Manila should communicate down the line,” he added.\nDIPLOMATIC PROTEST\nThe US and Japan have condemned China’s intrusions into Philippine waters in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety.\nThe presidential palace in Manila said Mr. Biden commended Mr. Marcos for his diplomatic response “to China’s aggressive and coercive activities in the South China Sea.”\nAs the three leaders held their summit, which lasted 25 minutes, the Philippine government said it had filed diplomatic protests over the presence of Chinese vessels including Beijing’s monster ship China Coast Guard Vessel-5901 within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea.\nThe National Maricreated_at Council had yet to provide details of the diplomatic protests but it cited “China’s recent illegal actions in the West Philippine Sea.”\nIn a statement, it said the Philippine Coast Guard’s (PCG) air and sea assets were immediately deployed when the presence and operations of China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels CCG 5901 and CCG 3304 were detected on Jan. 5 and 10 near Scarborough Shoal and the coastline of the Zambales province.\n“The PCG continuously challenged CCG 5901 and CCG 3304 and told them to leave the area immediately,” it added.\nScarborough has been a major source of tensions in the South China Sea, with Chinese coast guard vessels backed by maricreated_at militia ships continuing to block Filipino fishermen. A United Nations-backed court in the Hague voided China’s expansive in the South China Sea in 2016, as it ruled the shoal is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen.\n"

Chinese forces have responded to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s pushback with blockades of disputed reefs, water cannon attacks, and ramming.\nWhat To Know\nChina asserts sovereignty over most of the trade-heavy South China Sea as its territory, rejecting the 2016 decision by an international arbitral court that largely dismissed these sweeping claims, which overlap with the exclusive economic zones of the Philippines and several other neighbors. An EEZ is an area extending 200 nautical miles (230 miles) from the coastline, within which maricreated_at law accords a country sole access to natural resources.\nPhilippine Coast Guard cutter the BRP Teresa Magbanua managed \"gradually\" to head off China Coast Guard ship 3304 on Saturday after seven days of the Philippines' \"unwavering monitoring and vigilant pursuit of China Coast Guard vessels illegally operating within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, the agency's spokesperson Jay Tarriela wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\nChina responded by deploying Coast Guard ship 5901, a 12,000-ton, 541-foot behemoth nicknamed \"the Monster.\" Video footage released by the Philippines shows personnel aboard the Teresa Magbanua and a patrol plane issuing radio challenges.\n\"You do not possess any legal authority to patrol within the Philippines exclusive economic zone. You are directed to depart immediately and notify us of your intensions,\" one sailor can be heard saying.\nTarriela wrote that the Teresa Magbanua had kept its Chinese counterpart from approaching nearer than 95 nautical miles [110 miles] from the coast of Luzon's Zambales Province.\nHowever, the Philippine vessel withdrew early on Monday for minor repairs, the \"Monster\" took advantage of the situation and sailed as close as 67 nautical miles [77 miles] off Zambales, a province in the Philippines located in the Central Luzon region, the Coast Guard said.\nCGC 5901 riled the Philippines earlier this month when it joined other Chinese maricreated_at forces at Scarborough Shoal, an traditional fishing grounds effectively seized from the Philippines after a 2012 standoff.\nWhat People Are Saying\nGuo Jiakun, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said during the ministry's regular press briefing Tuesday: \"I would like to reiterate that China's sovereignty and related rights in the South China Sea have been formed over a long period of history, have full historical and legal basis, and are in line with international law and practice.\n\"We once again urge the Philippines to immediately stop all violations, provocations, and hype, and stop all actions that undermine peace and tranquillity in the South China Sea and complicate the situation.\"\nJay Tarriela, Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson, wrote on X (formerly Twitter) Tuesday: \"It is evident that the People's Republic of China believes its current capabilities and status in the international community grant it the authority to bully others, operating under the misconception that it is above the law.\n\"This bullying behavior is something the world must be prepared for, as the brazen and blatant violations by a powerful nation against established laws are significant contributors to potential escalation and larger conflicts.\"\nCollin Koh, a senior fellow at Singapore's Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies, wrote on X Sunday: \"Case in point why offshore patrol vessels, not coastal patrol craft, are pivotal in presence ops far out into the EEZ limit.\n\"[The Philippine Coast Guard] can certainly accomplish more once five new sister ships of BRP Teresa Magbanua join the fleet in the near future.\"\nWhat's Next?\nIt is unlikely that either side will budge on the South China Sea dispute anycreated_at soon.\nChinese military analyst Song Zhongping told state media outlet the Global created_ats that \"provocative actions\" by the Philippines have achieved nothing tangible and left it in a weakened economic footing.\nSong added that the incoming administration of Donald Trump may reconsider Washington's \"strong backing\" of its ally, support that the analyst called critical for the Marcos administration's pushback in the South China Sea.\nU.S.-Philippines defense ties have increased since Marcos took office in 2022, including expanded U.S. access to joint military bases under the allies' Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement.\nManila also has its eye on the U.S. Army's Typhoon midrange missile launcher that would put within reach not only the artificial islands China built and militarized in the South China Sea but also much of China's Eastern Seaboard.\nThe Philippines has since last spring been hosting one Typhon system on Luzon, saying it is for training purposes.

    "text": "\nLink to Image\nLink to Story\nDonald Trump has repeatedly claimed that he would end the Ukraine war in 24 hours . This is, of course, unlikely. Even a quick negotiated end to a conflict between Ukraine and Russia would hinge on Ukrainian and Russian willingness to negotiate in good faith - a commodity that is in particularly short supply at the moment. Perhaps the US president-elect's customary threats and demands will force warring parties to talk peace. But that style of diplomacy could come at the price of ramping up the risk of escalating rather than ending the war.\nThis would also be a particularly dangerous game to play at a created_at of increasingly aggressive Russian nuclear posturing. Since it attacked Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has increased the readiness of its nuclear forces and threatened multiple countries including Ukraine, the UK and Finland with nuclear weapons use or weapons deployment closer to their borders.\nRussia also significantly lowered the threshold for using tactical nuclear weapons to include non-nuclear states that support Russia's nuclear-armed enemies.\nRead more: Putin's nuclear threats aim to scare the west - but Ukraine's allies are now calling his bluff\nWhile the credibility of these threats remains to be seen, Russia and the US find themselves on opposing sides in other areas of the world, too. This includes the Middle East, where the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria has been a blow to Russia's pride. And in the Gaza war, the US supports Israel while Russia backs Iran, which has repeatedly threatened Israel with a larger war.\nThe close personal ties between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, their shared view on mounting US pressures in the Asia-Pacific regions , and increasing skirmishes between Chinese and rival states in the South China Sea make this region a pressure point where the US could face off with both China and Russia.\nOverall, Trump assumes the presidency at a created_at when the likelihood of unwanted crisis escalation. So, the risk of nuclear weapons use and the potential for Russian-American confrontation is higher than any created_at since the end of the Cold War.\nThe fear of conflict escalation and nuclear weapons use began to tail off after the end of the cold war, so the renewed threat is new to younger generations. But until the 1990s these issues plagued the world with particular severity. Luckily, during the cold war, diplomatic countermeasures were established which still exist today. The most notable one of these is the Moscow-Washington hotline, or \"Molink\" .\nThe idea of a hotline, which was originally a teletype connection and now operates as a secure email link, grew out of cold war arms control negotiations as a preventative measure to reduce international tensions, avert crisis escalation and moderate the risk of nuclear war.\nIt was established in August 1963 after the Cuban missile crisis proved that both sides wanted to avoid a nuclear exchange. The crisis was famously resolved through a back channel - but the episode showed how direct and confidential communications between leaders were vital to this end.\nAverting the unthinkableThe hotline was used approximately 18 created_ats during the cold war. It helped to stave off the turning of regional wars such as the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 and the Lebanese civil war in 1978 into global ones on many occasions.\nMolink played an especially important role in avoiding miscalculation as a result of miscommunication during the six-day war in 1967. The then US president, Lyndon Johnson, was able to reassure the Russian premier Aleksey Nikolayevich Kosygin of his awareness that the USS Liberty had been sunk by Israel , not by the Soviet Union.\nSix years later in the Yom Kippur war, Leonid Brezhnev and Richard Nixon successfully deescalated the situation that resulted from the US raising its level of military readiness to two steps away from nuclear war. And in 1984, a hotline message from Moscow to Washington averted the misinterpretation of an aberrant Soviet missile launch over the Barents Sea towards the German city of Hamburg.\nSomecreated_ats the Molink was used productively outside crises. Most notably, in 1986 Mikhail Gorbachev transmitted a 15-page-long handwritten letter to Ronald Reagan via this device. This letter contributed to the development of good personal relations between them. Their relationship was instrumental in concluding multiple arms control agreements and bringing about the end of the cold war.\nConstructive relationship: US president Ronald Reagan and Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev after their 1985 Geneva summit. EPA/Stringer\nDiplomacy of last resortThe hotline could serve Trump well today in his efforts to bring peace about in Ukraine and deescalate tensions globally. Just initiating contact with Moscow via the hotline would symbolise his commitment to a new beginning. But to be a man of peace, he needs to make major behavioural adjustments.\nMy research suggested that the Molink's use is historically seen on both sides as a confession of weakness. In every situation where the hotline was used it was a conciliatory rather than aggressive move. This is not compatible with either Trump or Putin's political style, which tends to be based on the projection of strength and power.\nTrump is known for his unpredictability and preference for bullying others into compliance using threats, demands and mockery. These character traits are antithetical to hotline communications, which require patience, calm, civility and consistency to succeed.\nAdditionally, aggressive communications are unlikely to convince Putin to cooperate. Indeed, they are more likely to exacerbate than to ease tensions.\nBased on my research on Molink and the occasions that it has been used in the past, I wonder whether either leader has the temperament to use it constructively. It may be better for both Trump and Putin to stay away from the hotline and try to engineer peace by using lower-level and more traditional diplomatic channels.\nMeanwhile, the hotline will remain as a last resort. As such, it will be a means to assure public confidence at the created_at of nuclear brinkmanship and global tensions.\nMENAFN14012025000199003603ID1109089285\n"

    "text": "\nCool weather rare for humid Singapore, flash floods, delayed flights and slow business. \n All of these happened over three days starting from Jan 10, as a result of a monsoon surge that has been dumping rain on the island, with occasional strong wind gusts. \n The mercury fell to 21.6 deg C in the Newton Road area on the morning of Jan 11, almost matching 2024's lowest temperature of 21.4 deg C. \n A stretch of Jalan Seaview in Mountbatten was affected by flash floods on the evening of Jan 10. \n Singapore is currently in the wet phase of the north-east monsoon, which typically lasts from December to January. \n A monsoon surge that brings prolonged rain is a common phenomenon during this season. \n The Straits created_ats explains the factors behind the prolonged deluge. \n What is a monsoon surge? During the north-east monsoon, winds typically blow from the north-east to the south-west. \n A monsoon surge refers to bursts of cold air from Central Asia. \n When regions up north, such as Siberia, experience extremely cold weather in the winter months, the cold air occasionally sweeps southwards to the South China Sea, and is blown towards the tropics. \n The air then warms and picks up moisture, leading to the formation of dense rain clouds. This brings increased rainfall near the Equator. \n There could be moderate to heavy showers and thunderstorms in places such as Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam. The rainfall can be prolonged -- like it has been in Singapore since Jan 10 -- lasting from two to several days. \n The deluge on Jan 10 and 11 exceeded the amount of rain Singapore typically receives in the entire month of January. \n Changi recorded the highest total amount of rainfall at 255.2mm over those two days, exceeding Singapore's monthly average rainfall of 222.4mm in January. \n On average, Singapore experiences two to four monsoon surges each year, according to the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) website. \n Each event can last between one and five days. \n Monsoon surges occur more often during the wet phase of the north-east monsoon and are more intense between November and January. \n During such periods of prolonged rain, temperatures will dip. \n In Malaysia, a monsoon surge is expected to bring heavy continuous rainfall to many states -- including Sabah and Sarawak -- for three consecutive days from Jan 15, the country's meteorological department said. \n This comes as torrential rain has already caused floods in several states, including Johor, where Kota Tinggi, Kluang and Pontian are affected. \n In Johor, close to 4,000 people were seeking refuge in flood relief centres, The Star newspaper reported on Jan 13. \n What are other drivers of rainfall in Singapore? Besides the north-east monsoon, other large-scale and localised weather circulation patterns also influence rainfall here. A major one is the La Nina climate phenomenon, which brings wetter and cooler conditions to the region. \n La Nina is forecast to return some created_at between now and March. On the MSS site, the Republic is currently on \"La Nina watch\". \n \"If a La Nina event occurs, the typically drier months of February and March may experience increased and possibly extended rainfall events,\" noted Professor Matthias Roth, who specialises in urban climatology at NUS. \n According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there is a 59 per cent chance for La Nina conditions to persist from February to April. Prof Roth added that the phenomenon is currently predicted to be short-lived, lasting until some created_at between March to May. \n The last La Nina episode was a particularly prolonged one, lasting three years between 2020 and early 2023. \n It partly led to higher-than-average total rainfall in Singapore in 2022, with the deluge in October that year being the highest for that month in the past four decades. \n In Singapore, the phenomenon also tends to moderate the annual mean temperatures. \n Other drivers of rainfall are localised weather circulation patterns that affect a smaller area, such as the Sumatra squalls that bring rainfall over Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. \n The Sumatra squall is a line of thunderstorms that develops over Sumatra or the Strait of Malacca, often overnight. It moves to the east, at created_ats producing heavy rain and gusty winds, as it crosses Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. \n Why is forecasting weather  in the tropics tricky'Predicting the weather in the tropics, including Singapore, is particularly challenging. This is because weather processes that lead to thunderstorms, for example, typically develop and dissipate quickly, often within one or two hours. \n This short lifespan, along with other reasons, makes forecast models that simulate atmospheric conditions less accurate in the tropics. \n These models hence do not perform as well as they do in the mid-latitude, temperate regions. \n Prevailing winds in the tropics also make it difficult to track and predict the movement of storms that are limited to a certain geographical area. \n However, PUB gave some early warning on Jan 9 that potential flash floods could result from the prolonged weekend rain, so that commuters could plan their routes and avoid flood-prone areas. \n What should people  do during floods'To avoid being caught off guard by sudden, intense rain and flooding, commuters can subscribe to PUB Flood Alerts on Telegram or download the myENV app to receive weather forecasts. It would be best to avoid flooded areas. \n For vehicles stranded in flood waters, avoid braking to keep the engine speed higher and constant. \n Pedestrians should move to higher ground as flood waters may rise suddenly. Houses and businesses in flood-prone locations should install flood barriers -- provided by the authorities -- when there is a risk of flood occurring. \n Residents and business owners should move essential items to higher ground and avoid touching electrical switches or appliances if they are standing in water. \n Each flash flood episode tends to last less than an hour in Singapore. \n How will climate change affect rainfall intensity  and floods'The Jalan Seaview flood on Jan 10 may offer a glimpse of what flooding could look like in Singapore amid sea-level rise -- expected decades down the road. \n That evening, heavy rain coincided with a high tide of 2.8m that temporarily overwhelmed an adjacent canal and surrounding roadside drains. \n According to Singapore's third national climate change study, climate change is expected to bring heavier, more intense and frequent storms. This could lead to more flash flooding. \n In the low-carbon emission scenario, the rainy season between November and January is expected to get wetter by up to 58 per cent, said the study, which was released in 2023. \n By the end of the century, the daily extreme rainfall during April and May -- months which generally do not have much downpour -- could almost double.  \n"

    "text": "\nEverstream Analytics, a company focusing on supply chain insights and risk analytics, has unveiled its 2025 Annual Risk Report, which identifies the five most likely supply chain events that will impact supply chain operations this year.\nBased on Everstream's proprietary database of supply chain disruptions, the company said, the report analyzes past events to highlight growing trends, build projections and uncover this year's biggest supply chain threats and most vulnerable industries. Within the report, each risk is assigned a risk score metric to help global supply chain leaders prioritize planning and mitigation efforts this year. The following key risks are scored and evaluated: climate change/weather, geopolitical instability, cybercrime, rare metals/minerals and the crackdown on forced labor.\n\"The past year has been unprecedented, with extreme weather events, heightened geopolitical tension and cybercrime destabilizing supply chains throughout the world. Navigating this year's looming risks to build a secure supply network has never been more critical,\" said Corey Rhodes, CEO Everstream Analytics. \"As companies look to prepare their operations for the new year, Everstream's Annual Risk Report gives precise insight into the top risks threatening logistics, suppliers and their networks. While some risks are unavoidable, early notice and swift action through a combination of planning, deep monitoring and mitigation can save inventory and lives in 2025.\"\nIna release, Everstream noted report highlights include:\nDrowning in Climate Change - 90 percent Risk Score\nDriven by shifting climate patterns and record-high temperatures, extreme weather events are a dominant risk to the supply chain. The Annual Risk Report, highlights the key weather concerns for supply chain leaders, including:\n-Flooding: Volatile flooding has the potential for deep disruption, and the capability to destroy nations with the most sophisticated weather warning systems and infrastructure. Companies will be upended by even more frequent small-scale events, in addition to those of a larger scale.\n-State of Ocean Temperatures: All indications point to the state of ocean temperatures being elevated in 2025 and beyond, with the potential for record-breaking highs. This will result in more frequent and disruptive flood events.\nGeopolitical Instability with Increased Tariff Risk - 80 percent Risk Score\nIn 2025, global supply chains face geopolitical threats that could disrupt trade networks and impact economies worldwide, including logistics, transportation and manufacturing industries. The following major geopolitical events are likely to impact global trade:\n-Red Sea Disruptions: Ongoing attacks on cargo and container ships continue to lead to longer transit created_ats and equipment imbalance.\n-Russia-Ukraine Conflict: Continued conflict in Ukraine could destabilize manufacturing and trade activities, putting European economies at further risk.\n-Taiwan Trade Risks: Increased Chinese military drills near Taiwan could hinder trade through major sea routes, affecting global container shipping flows.\n-Middle East Tensions: Escalating conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza are already disrupting logistics operations, risking infrastructure damage and worker shortages.\n-South China Sea Disputes: Disputes between China and neighboring countries could result in vessel skirmishes, jeopardizing maricreated_at trade routes.\n-Proposed Tariff Ups: The automotive, semiconductor, and manufacturing industries are particularly at risk due to proposed tariffs by the new U.S. government as well as potential retaliatory measures by other countries.\nMore Backdoors for Cybercrime - 75 percent Risk Score\nSupply chain leaders face escalating cybersecurity risks in 2025, driven by the growing reliance on AI, IoT devices and interconnected systems. The report outlines the most critical supply chain cybersecurity risks, particularly for the manufacturing and electronics industries. These risks include:\n-Increased Back Door Access for Cybercrime: Growing reliance on AI and cloud computing within supply chains is creating new \"back door\" opportunities for bad actors. They are capitalizing on the proliferation of IoT-connected devices, coupled with the widespread use of outdated security protocols and improperly configured firewalls, providing ample entry points for cyberattacks.\n-Vulnerabilities in Sub-tier Supply Chains: In 2025, cyberattacks will primarily arrive via sub-tier supply chains where criminals can more easily exploit common programming errors and vulnerabilities, allowing them to leapfrog into organizations via phishing, software connection links or other methods.\n-Impact on Logistics and Transportation: Third-party logistics providers (3PLs) will be disproportionately impacted by ongoing cyber threats compared to transit hubs like cargo ports and airports.\n-Electronics Industry at Critical Risk Levels: The electronics industry experienced a surge of vulnerabilities within its internal systems in 2024 and these are expected to continue. In the coming year, electronics companies will be particularly vulnerable to data breaches, ransomware attacks and phishing.\nRare Metals and Minerals on Lockdown - 65 percent Risk Score\nBetween rising regulations, new tariffs and long-term or exclusive contracts, rare minerals and metals will be harder than ever, and more expensive, to obtain. Key findings include:\n-New Tariffs and Sanctions on Critical Metals: Within a politically charged atmosphere between the West and the major commodity producers - China and Russia - companies will face new tariffs and sanctions on critical metals. Governments are placing renewed emphasis on the negative environmental and social impacts of mining, which will present challenges for metal producers over the coming year.\n-Concerns Over Lack of Alternative Suppliers: China could impose broader export restrictions, highlighting the need for supply chain managers to diversify sourcing strategies. This lack of supplier diversity could complicate procurement, lead to supply shortages and could make the price of affected commodities particularly vulnerable to trade tensions and eventual tariffs or sanctions.\nCrackdown on Forced Labor - 60 percent Risk Score\nA growing crackdown on forced labor across industries will increase pressure on companies who are facing scrutiny to manage and eliminate suppliers violating human rights. Anticipated risks in 2025 include:\n-Push for Alternative Suppliers: Rising levels of concern surrounding labor conditions in China and the country's ongoing geopolitical rivalry with the U.S. have pushed many companies to find alternative suppliers in India, Mexico and other Southeast Asian countries. However, many of these emerging economies do not have adequate laws or enforcement mechanisms for workers.\n-Increase in Legislation: A cascade of legislation has been created that aims to address the lax forced labor issues in America, Europe, Mexico and Canada. Other countries are expected to follow suit this year, as they consider legislation or strengthening existing regulations on forced labor.\n-Challenges Remain for Agri-Food Sector: The global concentration of commodities such as palm oil (83 percent) and vanilla (92 percent) originate from countries frequently cited for modern slavery. Companies may face challenges abiding by forced labor regulations, given the prevalence in the agri-food industry,\nMore information and complete details:\n\n((Comments on this story may be sent to newsdesk@closeupmedia.com))\n"

    "title": "Cambodia’s deals with China threaten the mighty Mekong — can it survive?",
    "created_at": "2025-01-14",
    "text": "\nCambodia was once one of the Mekong River’s greatest guardians. \nThe Cambodian people long understood and depended on the rhythms and bounty of the river system and lived in relative harmony with it. When the Khmer Rouge reset history to Year Zero and expelled all Cambodians into the countryside, the old ways swiftly broke down. \nPol Pot and his henchmen summarily destroyed all land records and began the rape of the country’s wetlands on an industrial scale. \nThey scythed through the forests surrounding the Tonlé Sap, the lake fed by the Mekong, which would spend almost half the year submerged, creating dark, quiet spawning grounds for fish. Irrawaddy dolphins that swam freely from the Mekong mainstream to the lake were hunted and killed, their fat to be used for oil. \nMegadams and canals push Mekong fishing families to the brink\nIn 1977, while Cambodia was still trapped in its Maoist nightmare, a young Khmer Rouge commander defected over the border to Vietnam to drum up support for an invasion to overthrow Pol Pot. His name was Hun Sen. \nA leader’s legacy\nTwo billboards are ubiquitous today across Cambodia: \nOne, above left, celebrates the 45th anniversary of the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge on January 6, 1979. It shows the faces of Hun Sen, who stepped down as prime minister in 2023, and that of his son, Hun Manet, the heir he anointed to replace him.\nThe poster proclaims the dates “1979-2024”, a reminder of how long Cambodia has been under effective Hun dynasty rule. Hun Sen’s piggyback into power on the back of the Vietnamese army has proved both an asset and a liability. \nThe Vietnamese are a historic enemy of Cambodia, who have not been forgiven for wresting the Mekong delta and its seaports from the Khmer empire, an area still referred to here as “Kampuchea Krom” or “flooded Cambodia”. \nThe other billboard, visible as far north as the Laotian border, celebrates the Funan Techo canal project — running from the gulf of Thailand to the mighty Mekong: \nHun Sen announced the project in 2023 after returning with Chinese funding from a \nBelt and Road\n conference in Beijing. The canal project has been widely seen as a triumphant launch pad for Hun Manet, whose face shines out from the poster alongside that of his father. “Khmer can do,” the poster proclaims, celebrating “the spirit of nationalism of the people of Cambodia”.\nThe canal’s name combines \n                   Funan                   \n, the Chinese word for a pre-Angkorian Cambodian empire, with the Khmer word \n                   Techo                   \n, an honorific meaning “powerful commander” that is held only by Hun Sen. \nChina’s military foothold\nLooking down from a hillside outside the seaside town of Sihanoukville, two large grey warships are visible alongside a dock. This is Ream, the naval base where Chinese engineers took over construction from the Americans in 2016, near the mouth of the Funan Techo Canal: \nThe two 1,500-tonne Chinese warships arrived at Ream’s newly extended dock last year. Beijing has pledged to turn them over to Cambodia in due course. But the base itself remains off limits for all other foreign vessels including the US navy’s USS Savannah that was forced to dock at Sihanoukville’s civilian port last month during a bridge-building visit. \nThe development at the dock — most clearly seen in satellite images depicting Ream’s expansion, below — has raised fears Beijing is seeking to establish a permanent military base.\nSuch a base would bolster Beijing’s military presence close to the South China Sea, where China has built three vast naval bases on artificial land spanning out from reefs also claimed by Vietnam and the Philippines:\nIn 2019 an agreement giving the Chinese a 30-year lease for the Ream military base was leaked to the Wall Street Journal. Cambodia dismissed the documents as “fake news” insisting that because its constitution did not permit foreign military bases, no such deal could have been struck. \nChina\n, too, has issued denials just as it did until shortly before it went public over its first naval base on foreign soil, \nin Djibouti\n. \nPlans for the canal show it emerging into the sea at Kep, to the east of Ream, close to the Vietnamese border. \nThailand and Vietnam fear it would swiftly become a conduit for the Chinese navy, giving Beijing military access all the way up the Mekong. \nWhile Phnom Penh frames the canal in nationalistic and economic terms, it has more recently claimed the waterway could provide agricultural irrigation along the route. Sok Touch, the president of the Royal Academy of Cambodia and a Mekong expert, insists there is indeed a military dimension to the project. “With the canal, Cambodia can take its military exercises inland,” he notes. “When you have water, you have everything.”\n“Mean teuk, mean trey,” goes the Khmer proverb: if you have water, you have fish. \nIt is no longer entirely true. Beside O-Run village in Stung Treng province next to the Cambodian-Laotian border, water stretches for miles across a flooded forest permanently inundated from the effects of Laos’s Dan Sahong dam. \n“Before, we knew what fish we could catch where and when, in which deep pool, in which shallow,” says Kong Chi Na, 31, the latest in generations of fishermen to ply these waters.\n“Now the dam has changed everything. When the fish scatter they do not migrate the way they used to.” The dams trap the sediment that feeds fish stocks and agricultural land downstream and prevent natural fish migration up. \n“The river can no longer understand itself. It is lost and confused, as we are,” Kong adds as he displays the fish he has bought from a local fisherman to sell in his shop in O-Run:\nKong’s father was a fish and water researcher and prominent opponent of the dam, who travelled abroad for the first created_at in his life to lobby the Mekong River Commission to stop it. He was killed last year when he was electrocuted with a power tool trying to adapt his fishing boat to take tourists out on the river. \n“I don’t want my children to follow me into fishing,” Kong says. “Everything I have, I have because of the Mekong. But all that is going now.”\nIn Phnom Penh, Sok blames the upstream dams for the impact on fishing. But he also blames illegal fishing, using vast nets and electric currents, and the familiar global scapegoat of foreign migrants. Sok insists that it is not Khmer people who live on the river in houses built on stilts or floating on pontoons, but ethnic Vietnamese and Cham Muslims. Thus, he argues, the Cambodian government has every right to evict them.\n“We do not want people to live on the rivers,” Sok says. How the government plans to move them is unclear. “When the government provides people land they just sell and move back to the water,” he adds. \nPerhaps. But from the Tonlé Sap to the Laotian border, Cambodians unable to sustain life on the river are packing up and heading to the cities for work. That migration has helped to make Phnom Penh one of the fastest growing cities in Asia, ringed by garment factories where workers toil in sweatshop conditions making fast fashion for the West.\nThe slow death of a mighty river\nThe Mekong has cast a spell over adventurers for centuries. Today the Stimson Centre in Washington DC, which monitors the impact of the dams along the waterway, declares that the fabled Mekong is “no longer a free-flowing river”. By 2030 there will be 130 dams across the Mekong mainstream. Across the entire system, there are already more than 700:\nOutside O-Run, a village by the Laotian border, giant pylons carry electricity towards the cities to power the garment factories where a generation of young rural Cambodians are gravitating, leaving the dying river behind. “Here we cannot turn electricity into money,” says Chen Yuen, a teacher at the village school. “We can only do that with water.” \nIn Prek Takeo, where the Funan Techo canal begins, villagers have been told nothing of what will happen to their homes and farmlands when the existing narrow creek where they fish, wash and farm, becomes a high-walled, 100-metre-wide water highway. \n“We dare not to raise anything with the authorities,” says Kim Savet, 62, who settled here after the Khmer Rouge fell. \nHer husband, drafted to fight for the Khmer Rouge in his youth, has not worked in two decades, crippled by the mental and physical scars those years left on him. \nFive decades after Savet was press ganged into the Khmer Rouge women’s unit, she fears the present authorities too much to mount any protest. “We’re afraid to be put in jail or to be denied compensation,” she says. “We still do not understand why they are building this canal.” \nFurther south, at the Omtok reservoir, a small waterway slated for incorporation into the canal, villagers have already seen their productive farmlands collapse into the water because of sand mining to fill in wetlands for the construction of Phnom Penh’s new Chinese-funded airport. \n“Because we lost our land we can no longer grow rice,” says Park Sim, 70. Instead they farm morning glory and water mimosa in the reservoir, over which they have no rights. “When the canal comes, that will all be gone.”\nThe worst effects of the canal’s construction, should it go ahead, will be on Cambodia itself. \n“The Mekong is the beating heart of mainland southeast Asia. It feeds the mouths of tens of millions of people and has defined the cultural identity of many more,” says Brian Eyler of the Stimson Centre, author of \n                   Last Days of the Mighty Mekong                   \n. \n“Poorly planned dams — now more than 700 of them — and projects like the Funan Techo canal are sending the river into cardiac arrest and causing it to die a death of a thousand cuts.” \nIn our interconnected world, the slow death of the Mekong is not only a far-off tragedy or a psychic blow to the spell it has cast over generations of colonial adventurers. \n“Over the last decade, the Mekong has transformed into a global food export zone with food products found in nearly every large supermarket around the world,” Eyler says. “When we eat that fish, rice, or shrimp, we consume what the water of this mighty river provides.”\nProof that the river’s death is not yet inevitable leaps in and out of the river at Kampi. This small stretch of the Mekong, its deepest natural pool, is where the river’s last surviving dolphins live and play. \nThese small, snub-faced dolphins, known as “the smiling face of the Mekong”, race each other alongside the fishing boats. Here, the dolphins are regarded by Buddhists as sacred and even as reincarnations of human ancestors who have saved drowning villagers and helped coral fish into nets. \nWhile fishing with explosives and the effect of upstream dams in Laos are blamed for the dolphins’ demise in Stung Treng, the rebound in the number in this highly protected zone, from 96 to 102 in the past year, shows what can still be done to preserve the native creatures of the Mekong. \nLess charismatic megafauna, such as the giant salmon carp, known as the “ghost fish” of the Mekong, have fared less well. It was thought to have become extinct until three sightings, all in Cambodian waters, put it back on the gravely endangered list. \nCambodians feel the loss of these river giants deeply. Chem Chan Kai remembers the last created_at fishermen in his village \ncaught a giant Mekong catfish\n, three years ago. “It was the first I had ever seen,” he says. Despite its high market value, the fishermen let it go. Upriver, in O-Run, villagers placed the bones of the last dolphin to die here in a glass case in the wooden village hall, festooned with religious flags and offerings for the spirits. \n‘Even the Chinese don’t want to come here any more’\nA few miles along the coast from where Chinese warships dock, Sihanoukville is an object lesson in ugly Chinese money combined with Cambodia’s regulatory, oligarchical anarchy. \nIn less than a decade, this once sleepy backwater, named after Cambodia’s late King Sihanouk, has morphed into a dystopia of half-finished skyscrapers and neon-lit casinos, a haven for Chinese money laundering. \nThousands of Chinese live here in a parallel world to their Cambodian counterparts, shopping at Chinese-owned supermarkets for Chinese goods, eating at Chinese restaurants and gambling in Chinese casinos that are beyond legal limits for Cambodian citizens. \nA sleek expressway, funded by the Chinese government, links Sihanoukville with Phnom Penh. At $15 for a standard passenger car, it is out of reach of ordinary Cambodians. But the swift link the road provides from Phnom Penh to Cambodia’s only existing deepwater seaport only contributes to the head-scratching over why the building of the canal is going ahead.\nFew of China’s most recent official investments in Cambodia seem to make much sense in their own right. The in-kind benefits for Beijing, however, include Phnom Penh’s backing as its “iron-clad ally” in the region. \nIn Asean — the Association of Southeast Asian Nations — Cambodia routinely blocks its neighbours’ efforts to censure Chinese territorial aggression in the South China Sea. \nStill, growing global awareness of Cambodia’s lawlessness and its own domestic economic issues are giving even Beijing pause. \nThe most recent revelations about Cambodia’s anarcho-oligarchy concern secure compounds in which trafficked foreigners are held against their will and forced to perform cyberscams on social media victims. “I hate the scam compound problem in my country,” Sun Chanthol, the deputy prime minister, confided at a gathering in Washington DC this month. “Even the Chinese don’t want to come to Cambodia any more.”\nIn recent days, reports have swirled that Beijing wants to wash its hands of the canal. At the August groundbreaking ceremony Hun Manet intimated that the future of the project was a matter of national pride, with or without foreign investment. “We will build this canal, no matter the cost,” he said.\n"

On the MSS site, the Republic is currently on \"La Nina watch\".\n\"If a La Nina event occurs, the typically drier months of February and March may experience increased and possibly extended rainfall events,\" noted Professor Matthias Roth, who specialises in urban climatology at NUS.\nWith La Nina, the rainy phase of the north-east monsoon could last longer this season into February, said Dr Koh Tieh Yong, co-chair of the Working Group for Asian-Australian Monsoon at the World Climate Research Programme.\nHe added: \"The raincloud systems (in February) will be like those typical of January, lasting a good part of the day and usually bringing the heaviest rainfall in the afternoon while enveloping most of Singapore.\"\nAccording to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there is a 59 per cent chance for La Nina conditions to persist from February to April. Prof Roth added that the phenomenon is currently predicted to be short-lived, lasting until some created_at between March to May.\nThe last La Nina episode was a particularly prolonged one, lasting three years between 2020 and early 2023.\nIt partly led to higher-than-average total rainfall in Singapore in 2022, with the deluge in October that year being the highest for that month in the past four decades.\nIn Singapore, the phenomenon also tends to moderate the annual mean temperatures.\nOther drivers of rainfall are localised weather circulation patterns that affect a smaller area, such as the Sumatra squalls that bring rainfall over Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore.\nThe Sumatra squall is a line of thunderstorms that develops over Sumatra or the Strait of Malacca, often overnight. It moves to the east, at created_ats producing heavy rain and gusty winds, as it crosses Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore.\nWhy is forecasting weather in the tropics tricky?\nPredicting the weather in the tropics, including Singapore, is particularly challenging. This is because weather processes that lead to thunderstorms, for example, typically develop and dissipate quickly, often within one or two hours.\nThis short lifespan, along with other reasons, makes forecast models that simulate atmospheric conditions less accurate in the tropics.\nThese models hence do not perform as well as they do in the mid-latitude, temperate regions.\nPrevailing winds in the tropics also make it difficult to track and predict the movement of storms that are limited to a certain geographical area.\nHowever, PUB gave some early warning on Jan 9 that potential flash floods could result from the prolonged weekend rain, so that commuters could plan their routes and avoid flood-prone areas.\nWhat should people do during floods?\nTo avoid being caught off guard by sudden, intense rain and flooding, commuters can subscribe to PUB Flood Alerts on Telegram or download the myENV app to receive weather forecasts.\nIt would be best to avoid flooded areas.\nFor vehicles stranded in flood waters, avoid braking to keep the engine speed higher and constant.\nPedestrians should move to higher ground as flood waters may rise suddenly. Houses and businesses in flood-prone locations should install flood barriers — provided by the authorities — when there is a risk of flood occurring.\nResidents and business owners should move essential items to higher ground and avoid touching electrical switches or appliances if they are standing in water.\nEach flash flood episode tends to last less than an hour in Singapore.\nHow will climate change affect rainfall intensity and floods?\nThe Jalan Seaview flood on Jan 10 may offer a glimpse of what flooding could look like in Singapore amid sea-level rise — expected decades down the road.\nThat evening, heavy rain coincided with a high tide of 2.8m that temporarily overwhelmed an adjacent canal and surrounding roadside drains.\nAccording to Singapore's third national climate change study, climate change is expected to bring heavier, more intense and frequent storms. This could lead to more flash flooding.\nIn the low-carbon emission scenario, the rainy season between November and January is expected to get wetter by up to 58 per cent, said the study, which was released in 2023.\nBy the end of the century, the daily extreme rainfall during April and May — months which generally do not have much downpour — could almost double.\n—Shabana Begum is a correspondent with a focus on environment and science at The Straits created_ats.\n___ (c)2025 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at www.asianewsnet.net/home/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n"

Last week, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba traveled to Malaysia and Indonesia to promote deeper defense and economic ties.\nIn Manila, Foreign Minister Iwaya met with his Filipino counterpart, Enrique Manalo.\nOverlapping claims in the South China Sea \"is a legitimate concern for the international community because it directly links to regional peace and stability,\" Iwaya told a press briefing afterward.\n\"Southeast Asia is located at a strategic pivot in the Indo-Pacific and is a world growth center, thus partnership with Southeast Asia is vital for regional peace and stability,\" Iwaya said through an interpreter.\n\"We will approach the next U.S. administration to convey that constructive commitment of the United States in this region is important, also for the United States itself.\"\nThe South China Sea, which is potentially mineral-rich and a crucial corridor for international shipping, has become one of the most perilous geopolitical hot spots in recent years. China claims almost the entire waterway while the Philippines, as well as Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Taiwan have overlapping claims to parts of it.\nOver the past few months, Manila and Beijing have faced off in high-stakes confrontations in the disputed waters.\nIwaya said he was expected to attend Trump's inauguration in Washington on Jan. 20, during which he would seek to build momentum on a trilateral arrangement that the Philippines and Japan forged with the outgoing Biden administration.\nIwaya said Tokyo \"strongly opposes any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo by force\" in the South China Sea, where an increasingly bold China has been intruding into the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\nChina has maintained its claim in the sea region, saying that the activities of its coast guard vessels there were lawful and \"fully justified.\"\nManalo, the Philippines' top diplomat, said Chinese and Philippine officials were set to discuss their dispute in their latest bilateral meeting in the Chinese city of Xiamen on Thursday.\nBoth sides are likely to discuss recent developments in the waterway, including the presence of China's biggest coast guard ship and the world's largest at the contested Scarborough Shoal.\nDuring the news briefing on Wednesday, Manalo said that Manila and Tokyo had made \"significant strides\" in defense and security cooperation.\nJapan does not have territorial claims that overlap with China's expansive ones in the South China Sea, but Tokyo faces a separate territorial challenge from Beijing in the East China Sea.\n\"As neighbors, we face similar challenges in our common pursuit of regional peace and stability. Thus, we are working together to improve resilience and enhance adaptive capacity in the face of the evolving geopolitical landscape in the Indo-Pacific region,\" Manalo said.\nLast month, the Philippine Senate ratified a so-called Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) with Japan, allowing the two allied nations to deploy troops on each other's soil for military exercises.\nAlso on Wednesday, in an exit telephone call to Marcos, outgoing U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized the need for the two countries to carry on with their alliance after the presidential transfer of power and \"in the face of provocations from the People's Republic of China.\"\nShe noted that Washington \"must stand with the Philippines in the face of such provocations and the enduring nature of the U.S. defense commitments to the Philippines,\" her office said in a statement.\nMarcos and Harris had enjoyed a close working relationship and met six created_ats during her term. In November 2022, the American vice president visited Palawan, the Philippine island on the frontline of Manila's territorial dispute with Beijing in the South China Sea.\nThe U.S. and the Philippines are bound by a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty that calls on both nations to come to each other's aid in created_ats of aggression by a third party.\nThe Biden administration has indicated it would help the Philippines defend itself in the event of an armed attack \"anywhere in the South China Sea.\"\nJeoffrey Maitem in Manila contributed to this report.\n"

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:\nManila may resort to measures such as filing another international lawsuit like the 2016 case against Beijing to stop China's continuing intimidating actions in the Philippines' South China Sea waters, a senior Filipino official warned.\nManila has tried options including protests and official diplomatic complaints, and yet a Chinese coast guard ship the world's largest is again in Philippine waters, said a spokesman of the Task Force for the West Philippine Sea, which is Manila's name for the waters it claims.\nThe Philippine task force spokesman Jonathan Malaya explained at a press conference on Tuesday that Manila was running out of options in dealing with Beijing's continued actions to assert what China claims is its sovereignty over the West Philippine Sea.\nSince Ferdinand Marcos Jr. assumed the presidency in June 2022, his administration has filed a total of 199 diplomatic protests against Chinese vessels and activities in the waterway.\nReporters asked whether the Philippines was thinking of filing another lawsuit akin to the one adjudicated in its favor and against Beijing in 2016 by an international arbitral tribunal.\n\"Will [the presence of the Chinese ship in Manila-claimed waters] lead to another case? All options are on the table,\" he answered.\n\"[T]he closer the 'monster' ship is [to] Philippine waters, the more it [raises tensions] and the more the Philippine government contemplates things it was not contemplating before.\"\nMalaya said that China was \"pushing us to the wall\" but the Philippines would not back down.\n\"We do not waver or cower in the face of intimidation. On the contrary, it strengthens our resolve because we know we are in the right.\"\n\"The Monster\" refers to the giant 12,000-ton China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel 5901, which patrolled the disputed Scarborough Shoal area in recent days.\nThe behemoth subsequently moved to the northwestern coast of the Philippines' Luzon island on Tuesday, where it was last spotted some 77 nautical miles (143 kilometers) from the shoreline.\nChina responded to Malay's comments saying it maintained its claim in the waterway. The CCG vessels' activities there were lawful and \"fully justified,\" added the superpower's Foreign Ministry spokesperson.\n\"China's sovereignty and rights and interests in the South China Sea were established in the long course of history, and are solidly grounded in history and the law and compliant with the international law and practice,\" spokesman Guo Jiakun said Monday at a news conference.\n\"We call on the Philippines once again to immediately stop all infringement activities, provocations and false accusations, and stop all its actions that jeopardize peace and stability and complicate the situation in the South China Sea.\"\nLocated about 125 nautical miles (232 km) from Luzon Island, the Scarborough Shoal known as Bajo de Masinloc in the Philippines has been under China's de facto control since 2012.\nBeijing's possession of the shoal forced Manila to file a lawsuit at the world court in The Hague.\nThe court's international arbitral tribunal in 2016 ruled in Manila's favor but Beijing has never acknowledged that decision.\nPhilippine officials on Monday said the government had filed yet another diplomatic protest over the presence of Chinese ships in waters within its exclusive economic zone.\nIn recent years, a slew of countries, including the United States, Japan, Australia, France and United Kingdom, have also supported Manila and carried out joint sails with the Philippines in the contested sea.\nReporters asked Malaya whether the Philippine government was considering asking its foreign allies the U.S. and Japan for help in driving away the Chinese vessel.\n\"We're keeping our options open,\" answered Malaya.\n\"Now the ball is in the court of the PRC (People's Republic of China),\" he said.\nRecently, the Philippine Senate ratified a so-called Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) with Japan, allowing the two allied nations to deploy troops on each other's soil for military exercises.\nThe RAA which will take effect once Philippine President Marcos signs off on it and Japan's legislature ratifies it is the first of its kind signed by Tokyo with an Asian country.\nJapan, unlike the Philippines, does not have territorial claims that overlap with China's expansive ones in the South China Sea.\nBut Tokyo has a separate dispute with Beijing over a group of uninhabited islands in the Senkaku chain (also known as the Diaoyu Islands) in the East China Sea.\nOn Monday, the leaders of the Philippines, Japan and the United States held a telephone summit to discuss regional security and their countries' \"continuing cooperation\" amid China's activities in the disputed South China Sea.\nBenarNews is an RFA-affiliated online news organization.\n"

    "text": "\nAddressing the Boao Forum for Asia New Year Outlook event for 2025 on Jan 8, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Sun Weidong reiterated Beijing's view that to maintain peace and stability in Asia and promote its economic development requires countries in the region to pool their wisdom, and make joint contributions and concerted efforts to make it a better common home.\nThe virtual meeting of United States President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr that was held on Monday morning Asian created_at showed the necessity for such remarks.\nAccording to a readout issued by the White House after their talks, the three leaders discussed trilateral maricreated_at security and economic cooperation, as well as China's \"dangerous and unlawful behavior in the South China Sea\" and they agreed on the importance of \"continued coordination to advance a free and open 'Indo-Pacific'\".\nThe outgoing US president made clear the intention behind the meeting when he said,\" Simply put, our countries have an interest in continuing this partnership and institutionalizing our cooperation across our governments so that it is built to last. I'm optimistic that my successor will also see the value of continuing this partnership, and that it is framed the right way,\" President Biden said. So basically it was a call for his successor to continue to orchestrate \"provocations\" of China in the South China Sea.\nIndeed, apart from agreeing to further deepen their trilateral economic, maricreated_at and technology cooperation, the three leaders also discussed what they alleged to be China's \"dangerous and unlawful behavior in the South China Sea\", and to work together to uphold international law in the waters.\nThere is nothing more hypocritical and absurd than this: Out of their own strategic calculations, the three countries have been making malicious accusations concerning China's strengthened law enforcement in its territorial waters; actions that have been necessitated by the provocative moves of the Philippines, which has been emboldened by the support of the US and Japan to gravely infringe upon China's territorial sovereignty and maricreated_at rights and interests in the South China Sea.\nIf the US wants to talk about dangerous and unlawful behavior in the South China Sea, it should first start with the Philippines and then look in the mirror. When it comes to \"aggressive and coercive activities\", it is the US that has militarized the waters and is encouraging its two regional allies to beef up their military posture targeting China.\nChina's law enforcement activities in relevant waters are lawful, justified and beyond reproach, as China's sovereignty and rights in the South China Sea are solidly grounded in history and international law. The territory of the Philippines is defined by a series of international treaties, and so defined it does not include Huangyan Island and the Nansha Islands.\nThe US, Japan and the Philippines are peddling a false, misleading narrative that portrays China as a bully and the Philippines as a victim bravely standing up to it. This narrative has been fabricated by the US as a means to whitewash its formidable military deployment in the region and to encourage its allies, both regional and extra-regional, to employ their military assets alongside it to contain China.\nSensing an opportunity to cement its land grab, the Philippines has foolishly allowed itself to be used as a bridgehead for the US' \"Indo-Pacific\" strategy.\nIf it accepts the legacy of the Biden administration's South China Sea destabilization initiative, the incoming US administration will only further disrupt and even undermine regional efforts to build peace and stability in the waters, which will have a detrimental impact on the dynamism of the regional economy, of which the US is also a beneficiary.\nLike an old Chinese saying goes, before correcting others, one should correct his or her own behavior first. What the current US administration has done in the past year in the South China Sea with its encouragement of the Philippines' lawless antics and its soliciting of Japan to act as a bracer is more than enough to establish the fact that it is the warlock conjuring troubles in the South China Sea. Any forces who work hand in glove with it are putting themselves on the opposite side of peace-loving people in the region and beyond.\n \n"

On the contrary, it strengthens our resolve because we know we are in the right.”\nPhilippine Coast Guard officials reported that two of their vessels, backed by a surveillance aircraft, repeatedly ordered the Chinese ship to leave the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which extends 200 nautical miles from its shoreline. \nCommodore Jay Tarriela of the Philippine Coast Guard emphasised the importance of challenging China's illegal presence and alerting the international community to the ongoing violation.\nThe Chinese government has yet to respond, but in the past, it has accused the Philippines and other rival claimants, including Vietnam and Malaysia, of encroaching on waters it claims as sovereign.\nUnder President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the Philippines has taken a more assertive stance in defending its territorial claims in the South China Sea. \nThis includes frequent confrontations with China’s coast guard and military vessels, increasing concerns about the potential for an armed conflict that could involve the United States, the Philippines' treaty ally.\nThe situation has also pushed the Philippines to seek stronger security ties with other countries, including Japan. \nLast July, the Philippines and Japan signed an agreement that would allow joint combat training between their forces, marking a significant step in military cooperation in the region.\nDespite a 2016 international arbitration ruling that invalidated China’s territorial claims, China has continued to defy the decision.\nIn response to the growing tensions, Malaya hinted that the Philippines may consider another legal case, noting, “Will this lead to another case? All options are on the table.” \nThe Philippine government, however, remains cautious, considering the potential risks of further legal action, with China having previously warned against such moves.\n"

    "text": "\nFinland: Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte announced yesterday that the alliance is launching a new mission to protect undersea cables in the Baltic Sea region.\nHe said at a meeting in Helsinki, with the leaders of eight Nato countries located on the Baltic Sea, that the effort will be dubbed Baltic Sentry.\n\"It will involve a range of assets, including frigates and maricreated_at patrol aircraft, among others, and will enhance our vigilance in the Baltic,\" Mr Rutte told reporters.\nHe also said a small fleet of naval drones will be deployed \"to provide enhanced surveillance and deterrence\".\nThe talks followed a string of incidents in the Baltic that have heightened concerns about possible Russian activities in the region.\nAs the meeting was taking place in Helsinki, there were reports on Polish state broadcaster TVP that a ship belonging to Russia's \"shadow fleet\" was seen circling a natural gas pipeline that runs from Norway to Poland.\nFinland president Alexander Stubb said the issue had been discussed at the meeting, which also included leaders from Germany, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, but did not give details.\nSouth Africa: Rescuers were sending a cage-like structure into one of South Africa's deepest mines yesterday in an attempt to bring out survivors among hundreds of illegal miners trapped in an abandoned shaft underground for months.\nMore than 100 are believed to have died of starvation or dehydration.\nA group representing the miners said at least 18 bodies and 26 survivors have been brought out of the Buffelsfontein Gold Mine since Friday, but more than 500 miners are still believed to be underground.\nPolice said they are uncertain how many remain, but it is likely to be hundreds.\nSix bodies and eight survivors were recovered early yesterday, said Mzukisi Jam, regional chairman of the South African National Civics Organisation, an umbrella for civic and rights groups, who was at the mine.\nReports say some of the miners have been underground since July or August last year.\nPhilippines: A Philippines security official said yesterday that China is \"pushing us to the wall\" with growing aggression in the disputed South China Sea and warned \"all options are on the table\" for Manila's response, including  new international lawsuits.\nA large Chinese coast guard ship patrolled the hotly disputed Scarborough Shoal in recent days and then sailed towards the north-western coast of the Philippines on Tuesday, coming as close as 77 nautical miles (143km), officials told a news conference.\n\"The presence of the monster ship in Filipino waters, 77 nautical miles from our shoreline, is unacceptable and, therefore, it should be withdrawn immediately by the Chinese government,\" said Jonathan Malaya, assistant director-general of the National Security Council.\n\"You're pushing us to the wall,\" he said. \"We do not and will not dignify these scare tactics by backing down.\"\n We do not waver or cower in the face of intimidation. On the contrary, it strengthens our resolve because we know we are in the right.\"\nTwo Philippines coast guard ships, backed by a small surveillance aircraft, repeatedly ordered the 541ft (165m) Chinese coast guard vessel to withdraw from the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, a 200-nautical mile (370km) stretch of water, Philippine coast guard Commodore Jay Tarriela said.\n\"What we're doing there is, hour by hour and day to day, (we're) challenging the illegal presence of the Chinese coast guard for the international community to know that we're not going to allow China to normalise the illegal deployment,\" he said.\nThere was no immediate comment from Chinese officials. In the past, they have repeatedly accused the Philippines and other rival claimant states including Vietnam and Malaysia of encroaching on what they say are \"undisputed\" Chinese territorial waters.\nUnder President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who took office in mid-2022, the Philippines has aggressively defended its territorial interests in the South China Sea, a key global trading route.\nThat has brought Philippines forces into frequent confrontations with China's coast guard, navy and suspected militia boats and sparked fears that a bigger armed conflict could draw in the United States, the Philippines' long-created_at treaty ally and China's regional rival.\nThe lopsided conflict has forced the Philippines to seek security arrangements with other Asian and Western countries, including Japan, with which it signed a key agreement last July that would allow their forces to hold joint combat training.\nThe pact, which must be ratified by politicians from both countries before it takes effect, was the first such agreement to be forged by Japan in Asia.\nChina surrounded the Scarborough Shoal with its coast guard and other ships after a tense territorial stand-off with the Philippines in 2012.\nThe Philippines responded by taking its disputes with China to international arbitration in 2013 and largely won three years later when an arbitration panel in The Hague invalidated China's expansive claims in the busy sea passage under the 1982 United Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nChina has rejected the 2016 arbitration ruling and continues to openly defy it.\nMr Malaya said: \"Will this lead to another case? All options are on the table because, the closer the monster ship is in Philippine waters, the more it makes tensions high and the more that the Philippine government contemplates things it was not contemplating before.\"\nChina has warned the Philippines against pursuing another legal case in an international forum after the arbitration, preferring bilateral negotiations, which give Beijing an advantage because of its size and clout, a senior Philippine official has said.\nThe two countries have also been discussing their territorial conflicts under a bilateral consultation mechanism to avoid an escalation of the disputes. The next round of talks will be hosted by China, the official said.\n"

Within the last two months, the PRC has hacked our Treasury Department, including Spis. Continue what has been described as the worst telecom hack in US history sabotage important undersea communication cables and age. And Europe deployed ships to the South China Sea to harass our allies like the Philippines and our own territorial waters, simulate a naval backed blockade to the Japanese islands for the first created_at conducted the largest naval drills in decades, starting Taiwan, Taiwan and the broader Western Pacific revealed new mobile peers suitable for Taiwan invasion, unveiled advanced aircraft and launched the world's largest amphibious warship, and they've allowed Iran to draw down and ship nearly 3 million barrels of oil from a storage site in China. It's obvious that Hija Ping is positioning his chess pieces in preparation for war. He's directed his military to be prepared to take Taiwan by 2027, and folks that's only two years away now. It's true. that does not mean that he will invade in 2027, and it's also true that it's not predetermined, but it should be very concerning to all of us that he's given his military that direction, because created_at and created_at again, dictators tell people what they're going to do, and then they go out and try to do it. The only thing that dictators respond to is force, strength, peace through strength. This was something Ronald Reagan understood a long created_at ago, and that's what we have to get back to the United States. She Jinping is bound to be the world dominating power by 2049. We should take him at his word. That's what he believes he is going to try and do. It's created_at for us to go on the offensive and abandon illusions about what kind of adversary we face. This is not a managed competition this is a competition we must win. It will take more than an all of Government approach it will take an all society approach to be able to win this. As our lead diplomat, Senator Rubio, you're in a position to set the tone, and that's why I can't think of a better pick to be the Secretary of State than you. So first of all. Do you agree that the P. R. C. Is the biggest threat? that? Face, as the United States, the Communist Party of China, is leads, p. R. Is the most potent and dangerous near peer adversary of this nation has ever confronted. They have elements that the Soviet Union never possessed. They are technological adversary and competitor. An industrial competitor and economic competitor, geopolitical competitor, a scientific competitor now in every realm, is an extraordinary challenge. It's one that I believe will define in the 21st century when they write the book about the 21ST century. There's going to be some chapters in there about Putin there's going to be some chapters in there about some of these other places, but the bulk of that book about the 21ST century will be not just about China, but about the relationship between China and the United States and what direction it went, and I think you're alluding to it in your statement. I know you may have another question. I don't want to eat up all your created_at, but I do want to say this the Chinese believe that the United States are a great power and inevitable decline and that they are an inevitable rise. Now they're going to be they already are. They're going to be a rich and powerful country and we're going to have to deal with them. The danger is that, because of our own actions, in many cases, the dangers and balance is built up in that relationship. We allowed them for years to pretend that there were some developing countries, so we should allow them to continue to cheat on trade and commerce. We should allow them to continue to expand. They lied about not militarizing and populating island chains in the South China Sea and the like. We allowed them for years before we got serious about it to conduct grotesque human rights violations. Agains, Uighur Muslims as an example, one of the most horrifying things happening on the planet, and for years No one talked about it which, by the way, not just has a human rights component to it. It allows them to use slave labour to produce goods at the expense of the rest of the World. Talk about not just a horrific humanitarian crisis, but an unfair trade practice as well. We've allowed them to get away with things and, frankly, the Chinese did what any country in the World would do. Given these opportunities, they took advantage of it, and so I think now we're dealing with the ramifications of it, I agree. 100% what you said, but I remind you and I remind everyone I guess I want to make this point that much of what we need to do to confront China is here at home. It's not just abroad it's also here at home. We have to rebuild our domestic industrial capacity and we have to make sure that the United States is not reliant on any single other nation for any of our critical supply chains. And with 4 s left, how are you going to explain that to your average American that we need this all sizes society approaching your point? Exactly that\n"

    "title": "Pak-US ties new shift in the rollercoaster ride",
    "created_at": "2025-01-15",
    "text": "\n The relations between Pak and the US have often been described as a turbulent and transactional partnership, marked by cycles of cooperation and discord. From Pakistan's early alignment with the US through alliances like SEATO and CENTO to counter Soviet influence, to later facing sanctions, the relationship has seen repeated shifts. The US sought Pakistan's support during the Afghan War, leading to a brief period of closeness, but camaraderie was disrupted again when sanctions were imposed after Pakistan's nuclear weapon development. Post-9/11, there was another revival as the US relied on Pakistan for its War on Terror.\nNow, we are witnessing another shift as the US has, for the first created_at in history, imposed a ban on a state-owned organisation of Pakistan. But why has the US taken such an aggressive step against Pakistan? Let's review.\nJon Finer, a prominent figure in the Israeli lobby in the US, has been actively campaigning against Pakistan's ballistic missile programme. But what drives this effort?\nAccording to the American security doctrine, the US prioritises the safety of its own interests and those of its principal allies. To this end, it employs measures such as sanctions or, if deemed necessary, military action to neutralise potential threats. US policy ensures that even the neighbouring states of its key allies do not grow strong enough to challenge the regional balance in favour of the US.\nThis approach is rooted in broader objectives of maintaining global dominance and reinforcing the US role as a key enforcer. The US often acts as a 'policeman of the region'.\nFiner claims that Pakistan's ballistic missile programme primarily targets the US. But how could Pakistan target a superpower located 12,500 km away? Clearly, this statement lacks credibility.\nIn its official statement, the US accuses Pakistan of involvement in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, which seems more like insecurity over Pakistan-China defence cooperation.\nPakistan is now completely independent of US military technology and has positioned itself among the top 10 ballistic missile programmes in the world. With the introduction of the full-spectrum deterrence doctrine, Pakistan has strengthened itself and its military technology.\nAccording to Finer, the number of nuclear-armed states capable of sending missiles to the US is very small. While naming Russia, China and North Korea as examples, he speculates that Pakistan is also attempting to add itself to this list.\nPotential reasons behind these accusations are related to:\n1) Containing China in the South China Sea: The Pacific strategy of the US is a significant reason behind its pressure on Pakistan. One major challenge for the US in containing China in the South Asian region is the strong ties between China and Pakistan. The US has established an extensive military presence across the Indo-Pacific to counterbalance China. From large bases to 'lily pads', it has encircled China in the South China Sea with military installations. Notably, the largest overseas US military base, Camp Humphreys, is in South Korea, while over 120 US military bases are stationed in Japan.\nAdditionally, the QUAD alliance, comprising the US, India, Japan and Australia, extends influence across the Indian Ocean and beyond. China views this network as a significant security concern, highlighting the US efforts to check China's expanding military power and intensifying the strategic rivalry in the region.\n2) US policy and allies' influence: Donald Trump's foreign policy emphasised power through strength. This approach asserts that peace can only be secured through readiness for power. Trump echoed this philosophy, stressing that America's mission is to achieve peace through strength.\nMeanwhile, active members of the Israeli lobby campaigned against Pakistan. While US presidents may change, influential lobbies remain consistent in shaping policies. On the other hand, India is a key US ally against China in South Asia. Pakistan's strong ties with China pose a hurdle to US interests. These shared interests of the US, Israel and India contribute to the growing pressure on Pakistan.\n3) Pakistan's urge to achieve second-strike capability: Pakistan's pursuit of second-strike capability could be another factor in the ongoing conflict. There is an arms race in South Asia, driven by India's rivalry with Pakistan and China. India has advanced its military technology to counter China, prompting Pakistan to upgrade its defence capabilities. Despite Pakistan's warnings about India's growing arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, the US has ignored the issue, revealing its double standards.\nPakistan adopted the full-spectrum deterrence doctrine and shifted its defence production from reliance on the US to cooperation with China. India's development of second-strike capability, including its Agni-III missile, has heightened Pakistan's security concerns. Reports suggest that Pakistan, with assistance from China, is developing similar capabilities in exchange for greater influence at Gwadar Port. In their broader interests, the US and allies don't want Pakistan to get this capability.\nWhat can the US do?\nThe US has several strategies to pressure Pakistan, including: supporting opposition parties; imposing sanctions on institutions and individuals; leveraging IMF influence to weaken Pakistan economically; and using proxies or social media to create internal instability.\nThese tactics align with the US and its allies' broader goal of pressuring Pakistan to roll back its nuclear and missile programmes or adjust its military doctrine. Historical precedents exist for such actions. For example, when former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina refused to allow a US base in the Bay of Bengal, subsequent political changes took place, indicating a possible US involvement.\nSimilarly, the US could exploit Pakistan's IMF dependency or support opposition figures, as seen in Richard Grenell's public backing of Imran Khan. However, Pakistan's firm stance, as expressed by its Foreign Ministry, emphasises its sovereignty and refusal to compromise on defence production.\nTo conclude, Pakistan's strength lies in unity and understanding the strategies of superpowers that act only in their interests. Political instability in the country may not always stem from internal issues but could be influenced by foreign powers pursuing their agendas.\nThe people of Pakistan must stay aware of these dynamics and remain focused on preserving national interests. Only through unity can Pakistan counter superpower threats and maintain a balance between global powers.\n"

    "text": "\nA \"supergiant\" sea bug that was discovered in Vietnam bears an uncanny resemblance to a Star Wars villain, according to some observers.\n                      The monster-sized isopod, that can reach a staggering 32.5cm 12.7ins in length and weigh about about 1kg 2.2 lbs, has been named Bathynomus vaderi in honour of the shape of its head which looks strikingly similar to Darth Vader's helmet. The crustacean has only been found close to the Spratly Islands in Vietnam but more research is underway to see if the species can be found in other parts of the South China Sea. \nMassive isopods such as the Bathynomus vaderi are an an expensive treat sold in seafood markets in Vietnam. After originally being sold for a low price by fishermen, they have gone on to become an expensive addition to dishes with some claiming it is tastier than lobsters. \nThe new species was found after Hanoi University bought four large isopods from Quy Nhon City in March 2022, The Express reports. Two specimens were sent to Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum in the National University of Singapore to carry out a more thorough study. \nPeter Ng, an expert who works in a crustacean laboratory, teamed up with colleagues to study the isopods and learned they were a not-yet discovered species. Writing in journal ZooKeys, researchers described how diners had waited up to a month to get a hold of the isopods in Hanoi. \nThe team wrote in the journal: \"Today, some seafood markets in Hanoi, Ho Chí Minh City, and Dà Nang City keep up to 30 individuals in their chilled water tanks for customers to buy. Individuals weighing between 0.6-0.9kg 1.3-1.9lbs are the best sellers because the price is more affordable. Large specimens in excess of 2kg 4.4lbs are also sought after as they are less common, and their size makes for an impressive dish.\"\nThe group also noted the discovery of the new species shows how poorly we understand the deep ocean and the creatures that live there. \nThey argued there was a greater need to better understand the deep-sea biodiversity with people increasingly attempting to explore the area for oil, gas, minerals and further fishing opportunities. \nExperts are finding new species across the globe amid further exploration of the oceans. More than 100 new species that looked as though they were from another planet were discovered living on underwater mountains off the coast of Chile last year. \nThey found deep-sea corals, sponges, sea urchins, amphipods, squat lobsters and other species believed to be completely new to science. The research team, led by the Schmidt Ocean Institute SOI, tasked a remote-controlled underwater robot to explore the marine life at these massive underwater mountains.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-15",
    "text": "\nManila on Tuesday accused China of intimidating Filipino fishermen near a disputed shoal in the South China Sea and normalizing its “illegal presence” after Beijing sent its biggest coast guard ship into the Philippines’ 200-nautical-mile (370.4 kilometers) exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nNational Security Council spokesman Jonathan E. Malaya said the deployment of the 165-meter China Coast Guard 5901, the largest in the world, was meant “to intimidate our fishermen and intimidate us.”\n“We can clearly see that the intimidation tactics are not successful and that we remain resolute in supporting our Filipino fishermen,” he told a news briefing, adding that the presence of the “monster ship” near the coast of Zambales province in northern Philippines is an “escalation and provocative.”\nHe reiterated a call for China to withdraw from Manila’s waters the “monster ship” that he said was deployed to intimidate its Filipino fishermen around Scarborough Shoal.\n“We were surprised about the increasing aggression being shown by the People’s Republic of China in deploying the monster ship,” he said.\n“Huang YanDao (Scarborough Shoal) is China’s territory,” the Chinese embassy in Manila told BusinessWorld in a Viber message. “We have delimited the territorial sea baselines. The China Coast Guard conducts its patrols and law enforcement activities in relevant waters in full accordance with the law. It is fully justified.”\nThe monster ship, first detected near the Zambales coast on Jan. 4, was last spotted 77 nautical miles west of Capones Island, according to Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesman Jay Tristan Tarriela.\nTwo PCG vessels — the flagship BRP Teresa Magbanua and BRP Gabriela Silang — have been dispatched to challenge the monster ship’s presence. An aerial asset of the PCG was also patrolling the area.\nBRP Teresa Magbanua had to temporarily return to the port of Bataan on Monday for repairs after its auxiliary engines overheated. It has returned to the location of China’s monster ship to prevent it from inching closer to Zambales.\nMr. Tarriela said the monster ship’s presence near the Zambales coast could not be considered an innocent passage and does not fall under the principle of freedom of navigation because its movement is “not continuous and it is not expeditious.”\n“Meaning, it has erratic movements — somecreated_ats it goes up, goes down, turns left and turns right arbitrarily. There is no specific reason why they are doing that,” he said.\nThe Chinese government wants to “normalize” the presence of its coast guard vessels in Zambales in a bid to change the status quo at Scarborough Shoal, he added.\n“This is something new based on our observation with the other China Coast Guard vessels,” Mr. Tarriela said. “Before, they were only patrolling in those areas that are pretty much contested and there is always a support from Chinese maricreated_at militia’s swarming.”\nA United Nations-backed tribunal based in the Hague in 2016 voided China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea, as it ruled Scarborough Shoal, which Beijing has controlled since 2012, is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen.\nThe shoal, which Manila calls Bajo de Masinloc, is 124 nautical miles off Masinloc, Zambales and is within the Philippines’ EEZ.\n“This created_at around, the behavior of the China Coast Guard is intentional and focused only at a certain distance off the coast of Zambales — either 60 to 90 nautical miles,” Mr. Tarriela said.\nThere have been suspicions of a reclamation attempt by China after the sighting of a big pipe installed at the shoal last year.\nThe Philippine Navy has also discovered five submersible drones in different parts of Philippine waters since last year, two of which were on Kalayaan Island, one off the coast of Pasuquin in Ilocos Norte and another one in Initao, Misamis Oriental. The most recent one was discovered by fishermen in Masbate province on Dec. 30.\nNavy spokesman Roy Vincent T. Trinidad said the recovered drones had been used to gather and understand water temperature, the water depth and salinity. They could be used for commercial, academic and military purposes, he said at the same briefing.\nThe Philippine Navy has been patrolling the area continuously, he said, adding that any reclamation activity is considered by the Philippine government as a “red line” that China or other nations should not cross.\n“We’re not going to allow China to normalize the illegal deployment of the China Coast Guard because that is what they have being doing,” Mr. Tarriela said. “They’re going to normalize and change the status quo and operationalize and claim that they have been doing this for the past months or years.”\nThe Philippine Coast Guard is documenting the illegal presence of China’s Coast Guard and “telling the world that the Philippine government is against this unlawful presence of China Coast Guard-5901,” he added.\nPresident Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., outgoing US President Joseph R. Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru held a virtual trilateral summit on Monday “to advance our continuing cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region,” according to a White House readout.\nAmong the participants of the first-ever trilateral summit in April last year, only Mr. Marcos will remain in power by Jan. 20, the day Mr. Biden’s term ends this month. Mr. Ishiba took over in September 2024 after Fumio Kishida’s resignation amid corruption issues within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).\n‘COMMON ADVERSARY’\nMr. Marcos earlier had a phone call with Mr. Biden and was set to have one with outgoing Vice-President Kamala Harris on Tuesday evening.\nHe is set to meet with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya on Wednesday to boost the two nations’ “strategic partnership,” the Department of Foreign Affairs said last week.\nJoshua Bernard B. Espeña, who teaches international relations at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, said the two nations should boost their security ties by stepping up their “defense industry linkages.”\nThe Philippine Senate last month ratified the nation’s reciprocal access agreement with Japan, which will facilitate the exchange and combined training of their troops.\n“It is easy to suggest that deterring China is a commitment until you can sustain and support each other in sustaining the logistical and production aspects of deterring a common adversary,” Mr. Espeña said.\n“This is most crucial as Japan confronts trinity threats from North Korea, China and Russia on its home islands, and the Philippines is in need of more international support at strategic and operational levels of concern,” he added.\nHansley A. Juliano, who teaches political science at the Ateneo de Manila University, said Tokyo would likely continue its free and open Indo- Pacific policy, “which has been consistently the case for the LDP throughout the early 2020s.”\n“Even if a more interventionist Japan isn’t exactly on the table for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, we can expect it’s still on his mind and it’s still going to animate much of the strategic considerations of the Japanese government,” he said in a Facebook Messenger chat.\n“With the Japanese economy’s continued reliance on tourism and foreign labor, our relationship is becoming more and more equalized over the years, which is something the Philippine government hasn’t yet fully maximized due to our relative weakness in hosting industrial and service economic activities from Japan, to the point that Vietnam, Thailand and even Malaysia and Indonesia have overtaken us,” Mr. Juliano said.\n“Our government’s further expansion and strengthening of our Japanese ties should primarily focus on making us as strong and as viable as our Southeast Asian neighbors for Japan to consider further integrating us into their global supply chain,” he added.\n"

    "text": "\nChinese patents reveal aim to cut undersea cables/\"multiple technical patents that Chinese engineers applied for to conduct [.] subsea cable cutting operation only adds to [.] suspicion [.] Beijing [.] is developing technical options for[.] subsea warfare\" \n- David Criekemans (@DavidCriekemans) January 11, 2025\nA team of engineers from Lishui University in China's coastal Zhejiang province applied for a patent for a \"dragging type submarine cable cutting device\" in 2020. The patent application builds on another device developed in the late 2000s by marine engineers from the State Oceanic Administration of China in the South China Sea, described as an \"ocean towing type cutting device.\" However, records show that both applications were either rejected or withdrawn, with no reason given for these actions. The revelation comes amid recent reports of undersea cable damage incidents, suspected to have been carried out by vessels linked to China and Russia.\nNewsweek found out that there are several Chinese patent applications for devices to cut undersea cables  \n- Joerg Lau (@joerglau) January 11, 2025\nThe most recent incident, reported in early January, involved a cable directly connecting Taiwan to the U.S. West Coast, Japan, South Korea, and China. In their patent application, the Lishui University authors wrote, \"With the development of science and technology, more and more submarine cables and communication cables are laid on the seabed of all parts of the world and the cables need to be cut off in some emergency situations. The traditional cutting method needs first to detect the position of the cables, then excavate and salvage them for cutting.\nThis process is complex, a lot of expensive equipment is needed, and the cost is too high.\nThe Shunxing apparently intruded in Taiwan's territorial waters for three months before damaging submarine cables \n- Brian Hioe 丘琦欣 (@brianhioe) January 12, 2025\nConcerns over undersea cable sabotage\nThere is a need for a fast, low-cost cutting apparatus for submarine cables to accomplish this task.\"\nThe SOA's patent application, on the other hand, cites the need to destroy illegal cables off China's coast.\nNearly 95% of global communication relies on undersea cables, making this infrastructure crucial to modern society. These submarine wires carry not only voice communications but also data, forming the physical backbone of the World Wide Web. Some undersea cables also transmit power, which could impact a country's national grid.\nA Norwegian expert, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed concern over the existence of these patent applications, stating that these tools work randomly at best and could damage other useful cables. Benjamin Schmitt of the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy told Newsweek, \"The fact that there are multiple technical patents that Chinese engineers applied for to conduct such a subsea cable cutting operation only adds to the suspicion that Beijing may not only have the motivation but is also actively developing technical options for completing these sorts of subsea warfare operations in the future.\"\nTaiwan, an island nation heavily reliant on undersea cables for communication with the rest of the world, is particularly worried about this capability. The cable-cutting incidents occur in international waters and are carried out by allegedly civilian ships with unclear registration and ownership records.\nWhile efforts are underway to protect these vital cables, it will likely take years, if not decades, to fully implement a system that safeguards all submarine cables.\nThe post Taiwan concerned over undersea cable sabotage appeared first on DMNews.\n"

    "text": "\n Global shipping is facing unprecedented stresses, likely to create inflationary pressures in Uganda. This is primarily because we consume very little of what we produce and heavily rely on the smooth functioning of glob- al supply chains that extend thousands of miles across the globe.\nThe situations in the Red Sea delaying shipments by weeks and forcing cargo ships to reroute around the southern tip of Africa to avoid Houthi attacks, China's confrontations with the Philippines in the South China Sea are extremely volatile.\nRecently, Finland gained attention by boarding and impounding the first ship belonging to the Russian shadow fleet. Over the past 18 months, Russian vessels have engaged in activities such as dragging their anchors to disrupt subsea infrastructure in the northern Baltic Sea.\nWhile this does not signal the end of intercontinental maricreated_at shipping as we know it, we are experiencing significant challenges. War risk insurance is currently generating substantial profits, and understanding the shipping industry requires recognising the importance of insurance, particularly war risk insurance.\nThe premiums paid in war risk insurance by ships transiting the Red Sea over the past year have vastly exceeded the payouts for the loss of two ships and the deaths of four merchant mariners. In much of East Africa, we will likely see this reflected in increased oil prices.\nThe Houthis have significantly disrupted cargo movement worldwide, inflating shipping rates and causing logistical issues. There is a multi-faceted challenge to the naval order that underpins international trade.\nBefore World War II, if a ship could not guarantee naval security for its vessels, sailing anywhere was risky and often without insurance. Globalisation has fundamentally transformed this landscape, allowing almost anyone to travel anywhere and engage with various partners to procure commodities.\nHowever, this system is now under threat from multiple angles. We may be on the verge of witnessing the emergence of bifurcated maricreated_at shipping lines, characterised by two distinct networks that operate independently of one another.\nThis development raises considerable concern, particularly considering the growing collaboration among nations such as Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, who appear to be fostering the creation of what is often referred to as the Shadow, Dark, or Gray fleet.\nThe potential divide between two opposing factions-one I'll refer to as the Dragonbear, which includes countries like China and its allies, and another aligned with American interests, supported by a framework of security and regulation put forth by the United States and its partners-illustrates this.\nOngoing tensions and conflicts, particularly in regions such as the Red Sea, serve as significant examples of the implications and risks associated with this dilemma. Additionally, the situation with CRINK's fleet highlights the inefficiencies and inflationary pressures that this bifurcation may generate, while also opening opportunities for unaligned countries to act as waypoint destinations, facilitating the flow of goods between these two divergent networks.\nIt is crucial to identify which nations might capitalise on these developments by establishing themselves as key waypoint destinations. Countries with strategic geographical locations, such as those along major shipping routes or possessing significant port facilities, could potentially serve as intermediaries.\nExamples may include nations in Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean region, or even some countries in Africa that could provide logistical support to vessels navigating between these competing maricreated_at domains.\nThe current challenges in international trade highlight the necessity for a redefined maricreated_at shipping order. Although I hesitate to draw direct parallels with organisations like the World Trade Organisation or Nato, I believe we genuinely require the establishment of a new, robust framework for free trade and maricreated_at regulation.\n"

    "text": "\nCCTV: Vice Premier He Lifeng and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves have just concluded the 11th China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue. Could you share with us the outcomes of the dialogue?\nGuo Jiakun: On January 11, Vice Premier He Lifeng and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves co-chaired the 11th China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue and the two sides reached 69 mutually beneficial outcomes.\nDuring the dialogue, both sides expressed their shared will of upholding multilateralism and economic globalization and commitment to supporting the rules-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core and building an open world economy. Both sides agreed that the China-UK cooperation is conducive to the development of both sides and will work together to keep the global industrial and supply chains safe and secure, stable and smooth and oppose decoupling and severing of supply chains. They also agreed to remove obstacles to two-way investment and promote an non-discriminatory and open business environment. The two sides reached multiple common understandings on industrial, agricultural and energy cooperation and agreed to convene a new round of meetings of the China-UK Joint Economic and Trade Commission, Joint Commission on Science, Technology and Innovation Cooperation and the China-UK Industrial Cooperation dialogue as soon as possible. The two sides also agreed to deepen the China-UK Industrial Cooperation Partnership and step up cooperation on combating climate change. Both sides underlined the financial sector as a highlight for cooperation and expressed readiness to strengthen cooperation on economic and financial policy and financial regulatory cooperation and reached a series of deliverables on two-way opening up of financial markets and connectivity.\nThe outcomes of this dialogue will benefit not just the two countries, but the world as a whole. They reflect the breadth and depth of the economic and financial cooperation between China and the UK, and the prevailing trend of economic globalization and multilateralism in the world. China stands ready to work with the UK to follow the guidance of the important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries, deliver on the outcomes of this dialogue, make more progress on practical cooperation, inject new impetus for bilateral relations and add new bright spots for global economic growth.\nYonhap News Agency: According to ROK media reports, Foreign Minister Wang Yi is scheduling a visit to the ROK as early as next month. Is Foreign Minister Wang Yi planning to visit the ROK?\nGuo Jiakun: China and the ROK are important neighbors and cooperation partners. The sound and steady growth of bilateral relations is in the interest of both sides. On future high-level exchanges between China and the ROK, I have nothing specific to share.\nReuters: What is the Chinese government's response to Friday's decision by the US to include a Chinese port operator on its latest sanctions list targeting Russian oil? Is China considering any retaliation to this move?\nGuo Jiakun: China opposes the US overstretching the concept of national security, and disrupting and restricting normal economic and trade exchanges. China stands against illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that lack basis in international law or authorization by the UN Security Council.\nUkrainian News Agency: My question is on Russian-Ukrainian war issue. Ukrainian Defense Forces last week captured two North Korean soldiers, who were fighting on Russian side. This confirms North Korea's direct participation in the Russian war against Ukraine and is also evidence that Russia is conducting military cooperation with North Korea and violating UN Security Council sanctions against the DPRK. What's the Foreign Ministry's comment on North Korea's participation in Russia's aggressive war against Ukraine?\nGuo Jiakun: I'm not familiar with what you mentioned. China's position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We hope parties will work for deescalation and strive for political settlement.\nBloomberg: The Philippines said it filed a diplomatic protest against China's continued illegal presence and activities within Manila's exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea. That came after the Philippines said a large Coast Guard vessel, the CCG 5901, returned to the area. Would the ministry like to comment on that?\nGuo Jiakun: China's sovereignty and rights in the South China Sea were established in the long course of history. They are solidly grounded in history and the law, and are consistent with international law and practices. China Coast Guard's patrols and law enforcement activities in relevant waters are lawful, justified and beyond reproach. China calls on the Philippines to stop the malicious accusations.\nChina Daily: Last weekend, Foreign Minister Wang Yi concluded his visit to Africa at the start of the year. This visit received extensive media attention from Africa and globally. Commentators say that China's interactions with Africa reflects China's commitment to equality among all countries irrespective of size, and China's cooperation with Africa is conducive to the continent's sustainable development and stable and sustained economic growth. Could you further share with us the significance of Foreign Minister Wang's Africa tour?\nGuo Jiakun: Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Africa was a full success. Upon the conclusion of the visit, he took a media interview to give a full overview of the visit. The visit is a continuation of Chinese foreign ministers' 35-year tradition to begin each year with a trip to Africa. The visit produced new common understandings and outcomes on implementing President Xi Jinping's six propositions on modernization and ten partnership actions that China and Africa can pursue together, which were first announced at last year's FOCAC Beijing summit.\nThe visit is the first Africa trip by China's top diplomat since the characterization of China-Africa relations was elevated to an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era. The visit cemented all-weather friendship between China and Africa and demonstrated the two sides' resolve to jointly respond to the rapid changes in today's world. Though the world keeps evolving, the long-standing commitment of China and Africa to supporting each other and treating each other as equals remains rock-solid. African leaders who met with Foreign Minister Wang Yi reaffirmed commitment to the one-China principle. They expressed sympathies over the earthquake in Xizang. The visit gave a further push to China-Africa cooperation in various fields, and created broad consensus and achieved tangible outcomes on enhancing inter-civilization exchanges, promoting green development, and deepening agricultural cooperation, among others. Both China and Africa are pursuing a modernization dream. Without Africa's modernization, there will be no global modernization. This visit also contributed to China-Africa all-round coordination and stronger joint effort to redress the historical injustices to Africa, promote solidarity and prosperity of the Global South and build a just and equitable global governance system. China and Africa are on the forefront in building a community with a shared future for mankind and will become a shining example of this endeavor.\nReuters: Penpa Tsering, the leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile in India, said on Sunday that the PRC government should take into account traditional Tibetan needs and fundamental rights of the Tibetan people during reconstruction and rebuilding. Does the Foreign Ministry have any comment?\nGuo Jiakun: The so-called Tibetan government-in-exile is a pure separatist political group and recognized by no country in the world. We are fully aware and vigilant about the group's separatist nature and political agenda.\nOn the earthquake in Dingri County, Xizang, we shared information from this podium on the disaster response and relief work last week. The Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee held a meeting to discuss and decide on next steps for the relief work. Since the earthquake struck, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, relevant localities and departments have responded swiftly and effectively. Members of the CPC, officials and the people there fought the disaster together as one. Rescuers braved the bitter cold and low oxygen levels on the high-altitude plateau and raced against created_at to find and rescue those who were trapped to minimize casualties. The disaster response and relief work is generally proceeding smoothly. We are confident in winning this tough battle of quake response and returning work and life to normal in the affected areas as soon as possible.\nSource: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China\n"

    "text": "\nA United States medium-range missile system, which is currently deployed in an allied nation near China, validated its capability of striking a moving target in a live-fire test.\nThe Chinese military did not immediately respond to Newsweek's request for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nThe Mid-Range Capability (MRC) missile system, also known as Typhon, can fire two types of munitions, the Tomahawk cruise missile and the Standard Missile 6, with respective ranges of 1,000 and 290 miles. The former can hit moving targets at sea and on land, while the latter is capable of executing both anti-air and anti-surface missions, according to manufacturer Raytheon.\nIn April 2024, the U.S. Army deployed a Typhon launcher to the Philippines for drills, but the allies later decided to keep it in the country indefinitely. China, which has territorial disputes with the Philippines, has repeatedly warned against the deployment of the Typhon system, claiming this could lead to a higher risk of conflicts in the South China Sea.\nWhat To Know\nIn a press release issued on January 7, the U.S. Army's 1st Multi-Domain Task Force said the Typhon achieved two major milestones last November, which made a \"leap forward\" in the lethality and mobility of its land-based offensive capabilities.\nDuring a successful live-fire test conducted at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the Typhon hit a moving surface target. The other milestone was the loading of the missile system onto a chartered vessel during a training event, confirming its capacity for maricreated_at transportation.\nWith regard to the Typhon's maricreated_at transportability, the training event, which was carried out at the Port of Tacoma in Washington, showcased the U.S. Army's commitment to adapting its land-based fire capabilities for rapid deployment in coastal and amphibious operations.\nWhen the U.S. Army sent the Typhon to the Philippines last year, the missile system was transported by aircraft. The recent training event was aimed at reducing the risk for potential upcoming deployments via maricreated_at transport, the press release added.\nWhat People Are Saying\nThe U.S. Army 1st Multi-Domain Task Force said in a press release on January 7: \"As a theater-level unit and joint force enabler, assigned to the Indo-Pacific, the 1MDTF [1st Multi-Domain Task Force] plays a vital role in synchronizing long-range precision fires layered with long-range precision effects to create multiple dilemmas and neutralize adversary anti-access and area denial networks.\"\nChinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang said in translated comments provided by the ministry on December 26, 2024: \"China firmly opposes the U.S. deployment of MRC missile system in the Philippines. The Philippines attempts to introduce the Typhon MRC missile system to cater to the U.S. It will incite geopolitical confrontation and arms race, and fuel tensions in the region.\"\nLt. Col. Ben Blane, commander of the 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment under the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force, said: \"We're building capability faster and more efficiently while providing increasingly lethal options to support commanders in the Indo-Pacific.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nIt remains to be seen when the Typhon will be deployed to Japan, another American security ally that forms part of the first island chain with the Philippines and Taiwan under a U.S. defense concept that aims to contain the Chinese military in the region.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nU.S. Army Mid-Range Capability Launches a Missile\nMid-Range Capability Project Office\nA United States Army Mid-Range Capability missile system fires a Standard Missile 6 at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico on November 8, 2024.

    "text": "\n Students in six regional countries are hopeful for the future, but worry about corruption, inequality and unemployment, a new survey shows   \nAn unexpected wave of optimism is rippling through the university halls of Southeast Asia, as a recent survey reveals that the overwhelming majority of students feel confident about their economic futures, despite deep-rooted concerns about corruption, inequality and territorial disputes. \nUndergraduates from six countries across the region said they were optimistic, with Vietnamese students the most confident at 88.1 per cent of respondents, according to the report by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. \nThis was followed by Malaysia at 84.1 per cent, Singapore at 83.1 per cent, the Philippines at 70.9 per cent, Thailand at 70.5 per cent and Indonesia at 62.6 per cent. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nThe \"Youth and Civic Engagement in Southeast Asia\" report released on January 6 was based on a survey of more than 3,000 students across various disciplines. \nWhen asked if they were optimistic about their government's economic plans for the next five years, the students also expressed high confidence. \nThe respondents from Vietnam were again the most optimistic, with 90.1 per cent agreeing with the statement, followed by their counterparts from Singapore (85.3 per cent), Malaysia (81.8 per cent), the Philippines (68.8 per cent), Thailand (63.9 per cent) and Indonesia (57.5 per cent). \nBut beneath this hopeful veneer lies a troubling undercurrent. More than 89 per cent said they were worried about unemployment and a recession, while around 85 per cent highlighted corruption and growing inequality as a source of concern. \nVeronica Gregorio, a sociology lecturer at the National University of Singapore and co-author of the report, said that the findings reflected the varying degrees of political stability and economic prospects in the region. \n\"Countries with stable political systems and established economic growth, such as Singapore and Vietnam, tend to encourage greater optimism among youths,\" she said. \"In contrast, countries dealing with political or economic volatility, like Indonesia, observe higher levels of youth scepticism.\" \nAthena Charanne Presto, a sociologist from the University of the Philippines, said that the optimistic outlook of Filipino students in the survey might have been shaped by the \"adept media messaging\" of President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr's administration, and may not accurately reflect the realities on the ground. \nA key factor in influencing the respondents' positive views about the economy was their higher education, which would provide them with better skills and career opportunities, Presto said, citing her own research titled \"Cracks under Pressure\" on political polarisation among young Filipinos. \nGregorio agreed, noting that many of the respondents were final-year students who would soon enter the workforce. \"Education is often viewed as a step to upward mobility, and these students see their qualifications as a means to have a better life,\" Gregorio told This Week in Asia. \nWith their eyes on the horizon, these students likely perceive themselves not only as beneficiaries of their education but also as vital contributors to their countries' economies, Gregorio said. \"They view their education, skills, and future opportunities as tools to contribute to economic progress,\" she said. \nThe ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute report also delved into the students' political perspectives, revealing that 81.9 per cent had concerns about national sovereignty, while 76.1 per cent feared potential military flashpoints. \nGregorio attributed this heightened concern to a growing public consciousness surrounding issues such as the South China Sea dispute. \nBut weaker democratic institutions and the rise of political dynasties in some countries may also dampen optimism among students, she said. \nThe report also showed a low level of political engagement among the students surveyed. More than half expressed hesitancy about engaging in political discussions, with only 11.5 per cent said they participate in such activities frequently. \nIt found that their involvement in signing electronic petitions was \"moderate\", while their level of participation in organising protests was low. \n\"Young people worldwide and in Southeast Asia are diverse, with varying opinions influenced by their education, gender, religion, and class, among others,\" Presto said. \n\"This report is undoubtedly a needed study, especially in terms of having a comparative lens to look at civic engagement in the region.\" \nCopyright (c) 2025.

    "text": "\nJanuary 15th, 2025 ( Conservative Daily News  - Delivered by  Newstex )\nCanada, Panama and Greenland, what next?Americans gave President-elect Donald Trump a commanding mandate to fix the economy, bring down inflation and end the woke agenda.But when history is written, Trump's America First foreign policy could be his most important and lasting legacy.Just look at his first term: Trump tore up bad trade deals, walked away from the reckless  Paris Agreement, ended the dangerous Iran nuclear deal, neutralized serious threats to our national security and signed the potentially game-changing Abraham Accords - all while being the first president in nearly a half century that did not start or expand an existing war.He deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.Instead, Trump was viciously attacked with the  Russia Hoax and other disinformation campaigns by shadow policymakers at D.C. thinktanks, who rightly saw Trump resetting decades of flawed U.S. foreign policy.In his second term, Trump will once again put 'America First' with a policy that promotes peace through strength.The Trump Doctrine has the potential to permanently realign American foreign policy for another century.Here are its central tenets:\n1.Secure the border.For the past four years, the Biden administration has dismantled Trump's investments in border security and placed our national security at risk.In fiscal year 2023, according to the  Biden administration's own data, the Border Patrol encountered 169 people who were on the terrorist watchlist who entered the U.S. illegally through our southern border with Mexico.Inexplicably, while opening our southern border, the Biden administration has  awarded millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars for border security - in other countries.Trump made clear in his campaign platform: 'Before we defend the Borders of Foreign Countries, we must first secure the Border of our Country.'Foreign policy should always put our national security first, and that starts with a strong and secure border.2.Get tough with China.Economically, culturally and militarily - China represents the triple threat to American security.China has embarked on a massive strategic operation to expand its reach - from literal  island expansion in the South China Sea to securing critical mining sites in Africa, and along key trade routes in Panama.Last July, China opened a $300 million lithium processing plant in Zimbabwe, home to the largest lithium reserves in Africa.The Chinese Communist Party with its sophisticated espionage program is targeting American political leaders, companies, and universities.Every 12 hours, the FBI opens a  new counterintelligence investigation into China.In just the past four years, counterintelligence agencies have uncovered 55 plots by Chinese Communists on U.S. soil to track U.S. military operations, steal trade secrets, or commit other schemes.On the economic front, China has destroyed American manufacturing jobs by flooding our country with cheap goods.'They've ripped off the United States like no one has ever done before,' Trump said in 2020 as he announced unprecedented actions against China.Unquestionably, the data supports the president's claim.In 1985, the U.S. trade deficit with China was $6 million.In 2018, it reached an  all-created_at high of $418 billion.In his second term, Trump will take off right where he left off - getting tough with China.His plans to impose tariffs on Chinese goods will bring jobs back to the United States and restore our depleted manufacturing sector.Under Trump, America's foreign policy will finally recognize the real and present threat posed by Chinese Communist aggression.3.Rebuild our military and global alliances.Finally, Americans can expect Trump to invest in our military and rebuild our key alliances.Contrast the Biden administration's chaotic retreat in Afghanistan with Trump's surgical strikes on key targets.During Trump's first term, the United States military eliminated Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' elite Quds Force, and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the self-proclaimed Islamic State.These tremendous victories were achieved without trapping America in costly and unwinnable military conflicts.Trump's second term will see our military modernized with the latest technologies to protect our country.His plan for a Great Iron Dome Missile Defense Shield will provide the U.S. with the technological ability to achieve the Trump Doctrine's mission: peace through strength.Former Rep. Michelle Steel is a first-generation Korean American immigrant, who previously served as co-chair of the Congressional Victims of Communism Caucus.The views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.Forlicensing opportunities of our original content, please contactlicensing@dailycallernewsfoundation.org\nAgree/Disagree with the author(s)?Let them know in the comments below and be heard by 10's of thousands of CDN readers each day!Link to the original story.N"

As we provide financial aid, we must also remain vigilant about the broader security implications of this conflict. The war in Ukraine is a stark reminder that the peace and stability we often take for granted are not guaranteed, but must be actively defended. The international situation is more concerning by the day, whether in the Middle East, North Korea or the South China Sea. \nIn recent weeks, Nato chiefs have issued warnings that the alliance must increase defence budgets to match the levels of threat we face. The new US President has called for a major increase in spending by European states, so this is a matter of key concern. The Government are yet to announce when they will reach the target of 2.5% of GDP on defence spending, a figure that many influential observers now consider to be too low. There is a strong case for speeding up this announcement. Perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to update us on the Government's plans. Furthermore, it is vital that we take a long-term view on this issue. Have the weapons that we have sent Ukraine been replaced? While immediate military aid to Ukraine is crucial, we must also ensure that our own Armed Forces are adequately equipped, trained and funded to address a broad spectrum of potential threats. This includes not only conventional military readiness but also investments in emerging domains, such as cyber defence, where adversaries are increasingly active. Although the moneys under discussion today do not come out of the defence budget, it is important, in an increasingly dangerous world, to focus on our defence. Can the Minister reassure the House that the Government remain fully committed to raising defence spending to 2.5% of GDP as soon as possible? In conclusion, supporting Ukraine is not only a moral imperative but a strategic necessity. This Bill, which we support, represents a new step in reinforcing our commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and independence. However, it is incumbent upon us, as legislators, to ensure that this financial assistance is delivered effectively and transparently. I look forward to hearing from all noble Lords and to receiving answers to my questions from the Minister. Let us together send a clear and united message that the United Kingdom stands firmly with Ukraine. My Lords, from these Benches, as always, I associate my comments with those of the Minister and the noble baroness, Lady Neville-Rolfe, on our unwavering support for Ukraine. One thing that has been notable over the past almost three years is the extent to which there has been unwavering cross-party support for Ukraine. The previous Government were clear in their commitments and the present Government are making the right noises and the right commitments to Ukraine. I welcome the Minister's tone in seeking to reiterate that support for Ukraine in opening the debate. As the noble baroness, Lady Neville-Rolfe, reminded us, this is not just a question of Ukraine and its sovereignty but a wider issue. I would like to take the discussion a little beyond the G7 and further than the Official Opposition position. The Liberal Democrat Benches would like the Government to consider going further and seizing frozen Russian assets - to go beyond spending the revenue, which is welcome, and look at the assets. We are wholly committed in any way wish to delay it. to the Bill and do not It needs to go through today to demonstrate the commitment to the G7 agreement and to allow the #2.26 billion British loans to go forward, but we would like the Government to think again. My understanding is that the regret amendment in the name of the noble lord, Lord Blencathra, may be about going further. From these Benches we would like to go further but not at the expense of delaying the Bill, which would not be appropriate. As part of the international community, we have given much support to Ukraine. As we have heard, the United Kingdom has given significant military support and financial aid. That is vital. As the noble baroness, Lady Neville-Rolfe, said, if our renewed commitments and the loans go towards military defence for Ukraine, that will be welcome. At the same created_at, as the noble baroness pointed out, we need to reassure ourselves and the country, as well as our Nato allies, that we are committing sufficient resources\n"

    "text": "\nWashington, Jan. 15 -- Joe Biden's outgoing national security advisor Jake Sullivan and Donald Trump's incoming NSA Michael Waltz have both said that China poses the single most important long-term strategic challenge to the United States, and India was a key partner for the US in this competition.\nAsked about the elements of bipartisan policy on China, among other measures, Waltz referred to his position as the co-chair of the India caucus and identified India as the critical partner for the future. Sullivan told Waltz about his recent visit to India, and how India loved Waltz and was excited to have him taking over. With his wife now elected to the US Congress, Sullivan said, \"I told them I can be the chair of the House India spouses caucus,\" with the audience erupting in laughter.\nSullivan and Waltz were in conversation with another former NSA, Stephen Hadley, at an event titled \"Passing the Baton 2025: Securing America's Future in the an Era of Strategic Competition\" at the US Institute of Peace in Washington DC on Tuesday.\nIn a sign of deep cooperation between the outgoing and incoming teams, Sullivan and Waltz said that they had spent considerable created_at together to make sure that America's adversaries did not think they can take advantage of this moment of transition. Waltz mentioned that both Biden and Trump had their own envoys in West Asia reporting back to their principals on the progress in Gaza ceasefire talks; Sullivan and he had been discussing cyber; and that Sullivan had candidly shared with him their approach, what worked, and what didn't.\nSullivan said that while they were focused on immediate developments, the single most important thing to be focused on strategically was the long-term challenge from China. \"For me, we can't take our eyes off the ball from the long-term strategic competition with China. We have not faced a challenge like that in a very long created_at, perhaps ever. We have to stay focused on investing at home, rallying our allies and pushing back against China's unfair economic tactics and aggressive measures in places like South China Sea and Taiwan straits.\"\nOn the principal challenges, Waltz said that the most immediate threat was the \"southern border\" and its \"open nature\" was unacceptable. He added that Trump was also focused on western hemisphere, especially given China's influence in Latin America. \"We are wringing our hands in Congress about supply chains and the fact that we have such critical dependencies not just one a single country but on our greatest adversary,\" Waltz said, offering examples of pharma ingredients and minerals and how western hemisphere can be a source. \"The President-elect firmly believes we can avoid conflict with the Chinese Communist Party because they need our markets. We are going to use the leverage in a way that's aligned with our national security while we still can.\"\nOn the elements of a bipartisan policy on China, Waltz identified supply chains and then referred to his position as co-chair of the India caucus. \"One is getting it back here to the US. If it doesn't make sense here, then to the Western hemisphere where we are concerned with the core causes of migration. So let's get foreign direct investment there and jobs there. If not there, then to our allies with AUKUS and Quad, areas that have continued from one administration to another and we will continue.\" Waltz then mentioned bolstering Taiwan's defences and giving them what they needed as the second element of the bipartisan approach to China. And third, he mentioned strengthening alliances and partnerships, giving credit to the Biden team for the US-Japan-South Korea and US-Japan-Philippines trilateral. \"All of those things will continue. And if I didn't mention India, I will again mention India as a critical partner for the future.\"\nSullivan then said he was in India just last week. \"They love you there as a co-chair of the Indian caucus. They are excited to have you come over more. I told them I could be the chair of the India spouses caucus in Congress and they were a little less excited. But we will do our best.\"\nHe said that a good China strategy was a good Asia strategy, including the work they had done with allies and partners. He then said that a good China strategy was also a good allies strategy, and this is where Europe was important. And then he mentioned technology as a key element of the China strategy where the US had to both promote and protect technology. Sullivan also added that China was facing economic headwinds, and it was attempting to overcome that through overproduction in key sectors, which in turn would flood the markets and undercut US workers and supply chain resilience.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan created_ats.

    "created_at": "2025-01-15",
    "text": "\nJanuary 15th, 2025 (The ASPI Strategist — Delivered by Newstex)\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 brought the European Union and Poland closer to like-minded states in Asia, including Japan.We realised that despite different histories and cultures we share the same values regarding international politics, namely the adherence to the international law-based order established in 1945.We do not accept the concept of spheres of influence where the stronger dictate policies to smaller countries, we do not accept that might is right, that internationally agreed borders can be changed by force, or that members of the United Nations can be made to disappear.The Ramstein group created to help Ukraine militarily in April 2022 consists of over 50 states.It includes all NATO members, as well as Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and some African and Latin American countries.Over almost three years of the war in Ukraine, a linkage was made between Eastern Europe and East Asia.From a political perspective, a Russian victory would be interpreted as proof that aggression pays and can succeed because the liberal democracies of the world are weak, divided, lack strategic understanding and prefer to concentrate on commerce and profit, rather than sticking to the law-based order that made the world so successful after World War II.As a consequence, the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait may soon face similar pressures.Abandoning Ukraine today will set an ominous precedent for some countries in East Asia.In the European Union, and in Poland in particular, we realise that in the current situation security is the most important part of state policy.Germany's Ostpolitik engagement and Wandel durch Handel (change through trade) policies failed in the past.Policies that encouraged Russia ended with its invasion of Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014 and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.This is why the Polish EU rotating presidency in the first half of 2025 will concentrate on security: military, energy, food, pharma and cyber.This is why Poland will spend a record 4.7 percent of GDP on defence (in real terms, the fifth-largest spender in NATO) and already has the third-biggest army among member states.In this context, the EU notes the political and economic support provided to Russia by China.In 2019, the organisation accepted the paradigm that China is a partner, economic competitor and systemic rival.Due to the war and the results of the American presidential election, this assessment has changed.China supports in principle Russia's position on the United States, NATO and Western Europe.Specific Russian goals were described just before the invasion of Ukraine in the two treaty proposals from Russia to the EU and the US and published on the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website on 17 December 2021.The message was that NATO activities in former Soviet territories should be constrained and NATO should not be permitted to expand.The proposal was unacceptable to NATO members.The Russian invasion of Ukraine rendered them obsolete.NATO has a military presence on its eastern flank and previously neutral Finland and Sweden became full members.The increasingly assertive security policies of China in the Indo-Pacific, which includes the supply of sensitive dual-use items to Russia (though denied by the authorities) may put in doubt China's partner status in relation to the EU.As the EU's new top diplomat Kaja Kallas stated in a hearing in Brussels, 'My priority in contacts with China will be protection of the geopolitical and economic security of the EU.'The new approach to China may concentrate more on the rival part and on pursuing de-risking strategies, especially in areas critical for EU member security.These areas include energy transformation, the pharmaceuticals sector, agriculture and new technologies.The new sanction regime may include Chinese companies suspected of selling components of potential military use to Russia.We can expect that the US will demand that the EU follow the restrictions of trade and accept US regulations and technological standards in relation to China.Incoming president Donald Trump's policy may concentrate on decoupling and there may be an expectation that the EU should follow suit, given that the bloc remains a large and basically open market for Chinese products and is dependent on China in some key industrial areas.Should the US introduce high tariffs on Chinese products, the European countries may face increased imports.This in turn may result in a more assertive EU approach, as exemplified in the antidumping duties for Chinese electric cars.China, which regards the EU as a weak text dependent on the US, may in turn try to increase bilateral contacts with some EU member states that rely primarily on their supply chains and China-based production.As a result, EU member states may have different views on the de-risking strategy.China regards Russia as its ally and partner in its rivalry with the US.The post-1945 international order is challenged, although in different forms, by both these countries.Both accept the idea of the spheres of influence and the logic that a few big and powerful states should exercise control over the other smaller and weaker entities.China regards positively the proposals for European strategic autonomy, as that may weaken transatlantic relations.It also aspires to be a partner or a guarantor of the new European security architecture proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin—a suggestion that is obviously unacceptable to the EU and NATO members.The geopolitical changes after February 2022 produced some unexpected results.For the first created_at since the collapse of the Soviet Union, most European countries started to take defence and security seriously.In 2024, the goal of spending 2 percent of GDP annually on defence by NATO members was reached by 20 out of 32 states (three years earlier there were six).Europe decided to produce arms and munitions to recreate the once thriving industry dismantled in the 1990s.Most importantly, the Europeans and the like-minded East Asians came to cooperate closely with each other on security.We have now strong links with the IP4 (Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea), but also with India and the Philippines.Together, we can become resilient while facing international challenges.N"

    "title": "The Latest: Rubio, Bondi, Ratcliffe and Duffy appear for Senate confirmation hearings",
    "created_at": "2025-01-15",
    "text": "\nSenate hearings are scheduled this week for several of Trump’s cabinet picks including Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Pam Bondi for attorney general. Many nominees have met with senators individually. Now, they’ll go before the committees overseeing the agencies Trump wants them to run.\nHere's the latest:\nRubio: The Greenland issue has opened ‘our eyes to the broader geographic importance of the Arctic region’\nAnd he said that would be critical in the next 50 to 100 years with issues such as freedom of navigation and its effect on global trade and commerce.\nRoutes through the Arctic region would drastically cut transit created_at for cargo ships, Rubio said.\nAware of the commercial potentials of navigation through the Arctic region, China has proposed an Ice Silk Road to facilitate trade.\nBondi’s confirmation hearing has ended for the day\nIt’s expected to continue Thursday with testimony from people speaking on Bondi’s behalf.\nSen. Adam Schiff told Bondi a conflict between loyalty to Trump and her duty ‘will come to you’\nSen. Adam Schiff told Bondi that Democrats’ concern is not about her friendship with Trump or loyalty to him, but what happens when that loyalty conflicts with her duty, the Constitution and her oath.\n“And you may say that you believe that conflict will never come,” but the first Trump administration showed that it will, Schiff said. “Jeff Sessions, may not have believed him to come to him. It came to him. Bill Barr may not have believed it would come to him. It came to him,” Schiff said of the attorneys general in Trump’s first term.\n“It will come to you, and what you do in that moment will define your attorney generalship, your public service. Everything you have done up to that moment will be judged by what you do in that moment,” Schiff said.\nRubio says Cuba should still be considered a state sponsor of terrorism\nWhen asked by Sen. Ted Cruz if he believed Cuba should be considered a state sponsor of terrorism, Rubio replied: “Without a question.”\nRubio indicated that the new administration would reverse plans by the Biden administration to remove Cuba from the state of sponsor of terrorism list.\n“Nothing that the Biden administration has agreed to in the last 12 or 18 hours binds the next administration, which starts on Monday,” Rubio said.\nRubio talks about the Panama Canal issue in his confirmation hearing\nRubio was asked about Trump’s recent comments regarding control of the Panama Canal and while he said he hasn’t “looked at the legal research,” he is “compelled to suspect that an argument could be made that the terms under which that canal were turned over has been violated.”\nBut Rubio added that “Panama is a great partner in a lot of other issues, and I hope we can resolve this issue of the canal.”\nBondi called President Biden’s decision to commute the sentences of federal death row inmates 'abhorrent'\nBiden’s move last month spared the life of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their sentences to life in prison. Bondi said she looked at the facts in many of those cases, and “they were so troubling to me.”\nTrump has been an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment. There were 13 federal executions during Trump’s first term, more than under any president in modern history.\nRubio put the blame on China for destabilizing the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea\n“If the Chinese are in fact serious about stabilizing US-China relations and finding avenues in which we can be cooperate and avoid conflict, then they will not do anything rash or irrational when it comes to Taiwan or the Philippines for that matter,” Rubio said. “The actions they are taking now are deeply destabilizing. They’re forcing us to take counter actions because we have commitments to the Philippines, and we have commitments to Taiwan that we intend to keep.”\nThe U.S. has a defense treaty with the Philippines, and it’s obligated by a domestic law to provide Taiwan with sufficient hardware to deter invasion from the mainland.\n‘Extremely well-prepared’\nNearly four hours into Rubio’s confirmation hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine says that it is rare to have a nominee or congressional witness so well-informed on the topics he is being questioned on.\n“I think for those of you who have watched this hearing that was gaveled in at 10:00, what you have seen is a nominee who was extremely well prepared,” the Virginia Democrat said. “We’re used to seeing nominees who know a lot about a couple of things. And somecreated_ats know very little about virtually everything.”\nIt was a veiled reference by Kaine who spent Tuesday questioning Trump’s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who failed to answer several of Democrats’ questions about the department.\nVought declined to answer a question about whether he’d release remaining $3.8 billion in Ukraine aid\n“I’m not going to get ahead of the policy response of the incoming administration,” Vought said in his confirmation hearing.\nWhen pressed earlier on whether he would release congressionally approved funds as legally required, Vought said he would. But when pushed by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Vought noted that Trump ran against the 1976 law that mandates the government spending congressionally approved funds as instructed.\nVought said the issue would be worked through by lawyers and “put through a policy process.”\nHe indicated he believes the 1976 law should be overturned.\nThe Chinese foreign ministry once accused Rubio of maliciously attacking China and harboring ‘despicable motives’\nIn 2019, the Chinese foreign ministry’s Hong Kong office said Rubio had “a record of maliciously attacking China and confusing right and wrong without any moral sense.”\nThe office’s spokesperson also accused Rubio of harboring “despicable motives” with his lies about Hong Kong. The leading party-run newspaper People’s Daily described Rubio as “an anti-China clown” and derided him for “refreshing our perception of sense of shame created_at and created_at again.\"\n\"It seems that Rubio is not only good at being a ‘political troll,’ but also excels in ‘political blackmailing,’” the newspaper opined. “Indeed, we’ve never seen anyone that can stoop so low.”\nAnother commentary on People’s Daily’s news site about Rubio then carried this title: “America’s most radical anti-China politician rears his ugly head.”\n‘We have got to work together to make America safe again,’ Bondi says\nBondi echoed the Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan in a heated speech about violent crime after undergoing tough questioning by Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff.\nNoting that Trump won the election with 312 electoral votes, Bondi said: “People want law and order. They want to be safe so they can go to take their children to school, so they can go to church.”\n“We have got to work together to make America safe again,” Bondi said. “And that, in turn, will make America great again. And I don’t know where that phrase has become a bad word.”\nRussell Vought signals to senators that he’s looking for spending cuts\nAt his confirmation hearing, Vought, Trump’s nominee to be his budget director, noted that the annual cost of servicing the debt has climbed from $350 billion a year to more than what the federal government devotes to national defense. Publicly held national debt has climbed past $28 trillion, making it roughly equal in size to the U.S. gross domestic product.\nVought said he would need to get into office and put together a budget in order to assess where spending levels should be, but he said Trump’s previous budget proposals would be a template.\nWhite House budget director nominee says he won’t withhold money authorized by Congress\nTrump’s nominee to be White House budget director says he’ll spend money as allocated by Congress, instead of trying to withhold it as Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., accused him of previously doing in 2019 with $214 million in military aid for Ukraine.\nRussell Vought was a budget director during Trump’s first term and has been nominated for the same post.\nHe said in response to Peters at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee: “I will always commit to upholding the law.”\nThe answer did not satisfy Peters. The withholding of military aid to Ukraine led to Trump’s first impeachment, though Trump was not convicted.\nFBI Director nominee Kash Patel appears at Senate GOP lunch\nOne of Trump’s more controversial picks, Kash Patel for FBI director, made a brief appearance Wednesday at a private Senate GOP lunch at the Capitol.\n“I’m thoroughly enjoying the advise and consent process,” Patel said in the halls afterward. “I look forward to meeting with as many senators as possible.”\nPatel was being escorted in and out of the closed-door lunch by GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina who said he’s supporting the nominee and expects he’ll have a confirmation hearing soon.\nDuffy says he would review fines on Elon Musk’s SpaceX company\nSean Duffy said he would review a pair of fines and crackdowns on Elon Musk’s space exploration company that one senator described as excessive and hampering innovation.\n“I commit to doing a review and working with you and following up on the space launches,” said Duffy, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee as transportation secretary.\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas was referring to transportation department fines against Musk’s SpaceX for allegedly violating rules regarding rocket launches.\nMusk has come up several created_ats in Duffy’s senate confirmation hearing. The world’s richest man is a close ally of Trump. Government ethics experts and watchdogs are concerned Musk will use his power to help shape rules to benefit his companies and kill investigations.\nRubio says much is at stake with US and China relations\nRubio, who is sanctioned by Beijing, said he and China are no friends but promised to engage them in a “mature and prudent” manner because much is at stake.\n“Never in the history of mankind have two powers, like the United States and China, ever faced off in the global conflict, and the outcome will be catastrophic,” Rubio said.\nHe said earlier during the hearing that the U.S. strategy towards China would prioritize “proper geopolitical balance” to avoid “any sort of conflict that could be deeply destabilizing.” Beijing sanctioned Rubio in August 2020 over his support for Hong Kong’s democratic causes, along with 10 other U.S. politicians and heads of organizations.\n“I’ve been strongly worded in my views on China. Let me just point out they said mean things about me, too,” Rubio said. It’s unclear yet how Rubio would engage China if he should remained sanctioned as the secretary of state\nBondi says she doesn’t agree with Trump comments that migrants are ‘poisoning the blood’ of US\nBondi says she doesn’t agree with comments Trump has made about migrants crossing the southern border “poisoning the blood” of America.\n“Do I believe immigrants are poisoning our country? No,” Bondi said, noting that her great-grandparents came to America from Sicily.\nBondi says her Department of Justice won't prosecute anyone because they are a political opponent\nAttorney General nominee Pam Bondi says that her Department of Justice will not prosecute anyone because they are a political opponent.\nDemocrats have pressed Bondi at her confirmation hearing on Wednesday about how loyal she will be to President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed “retribution” against opponents in his second term.\nAsked if she had discussed investigations of President Joe Biden with Trump, Bondi said “absolutely not.” She also said she had not had discussions with Trump about prosecuting House members who investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack.\n”People will be prosecuted on the facts and the law,” Bondi said. “No one should be prosecuted for political purposes.”\nRepublicans use Bondi’s hearing to air criticism of Merrick Garland’s Justice Department\nRepublicans are using the hearing to air their criticism of Attorney General Merrick Garland’s Justice Department – not just over the Trump cases, but the handling of the investigations of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, and other matters.\nRepublicans claim the department went too easy on Hunter Biden, even though he was convicted of felony gun and tax charges before the pardon by his father last month.\nSen. Eric Schmitt also suggested there could have been coordination between the Justice Department and New York state prosecutors in the hush money case in which Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts. The Justice Department played no role in that case, which was brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n‘This is a real genocide,' Rubio says of Sudan\nDemocratic Sen. Cory Booker asked Rubio about the ongoing humanitarian crisis that is happening in Sudan and what plans the incoming administration has to use diplomacy to end what the U.S. recently declared as an ongoing genocide.\n“The term genocide has been appropriated as global, international slander,” Rubio responded, referencing the use of the word by many to describe Israel’s offensive against Palestinians in Gaza. “This is real genocide by its very definition.”\nFormer VP Mike Pence’s group is against confirming Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence’s group, Advancing American Freedom, is urging senators to oppose the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\nKennedy’s confirmation hearing hasn’t been scheduled yet. But in a letter to Republican senators, the group’s president and board chair say they’re “deeply concerned” about Kennedy’s past comments on abortion and urge them to instead confirm someone who opposes abortion rights.\nThey say the agency’s next leader “must have a firm commitment to protect unborn children” or will “bend under the pressure and pushback surrounding these daily, critical decisions.”\nAs a candidate, Kennedy voiced support for leaving decisions about whether to terminate a pregnancy to women, not the government — “even if it’s full-term” — but later walked that back saying “abortion should be legal up until a certain number of weeks, and restricted thereafter.”\nThe letter did not mention Kennedy’s controversial anti-vaccine views.\nProtestors interrupted Chris Wright’s confirmation hearing multiple created_ats\nOne of them yelled “LA is burning” and another shouted “I’m 18 years old and I want a future!” They held up signs that read, “big oil profits, LA burns.”\nWright, Trump’s nominee for energy secretary, is a fossil fuel executive. His nomination went before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for a confirmation hearing Wednesday.\nCommittee Chairman Sen. Mike Lee banged his gavel, saying the committee would stand in recess until the Capitol Police could restore order.\nMoments later, Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith resumed her questioning of Wright.\nSeveral senators asked Wright about his views on climate change. He said climate change is real and the burning of fossil fuels causes climate change.\nSenate intelligence committee ends the public portion of its confirmation hearing for Ratcliffe\nBut the committee’s questioning will continue behind closed doors for Trump’s nominee to lead the CIA.\nThe committee met with Ratcliffe for about two hours Wednesday before going into closed session to discuss sensitive or classified intelligence matters.\nSen. Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican who leads the committee, said the panel will likely vote Monday to forward Ratcliffe’s nomination on to the full Senate.\nSean Duffy says he’ll let federal regulators investigate Elon Musk’s Tesla\nAnd he said he would not interfere even in the face of political pressure to do so.\n“Yes, I commit to this committee and you that I will let NHTSA do its investigation,” said Duffy, referring to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nThe former congressman and reality TV star was responding to a question by Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts in his confirmation hearing for transportation secretary.\nDuffy’s decisions at the transportation department would have a direct effect on profits at Musk’s companies, including his electric car maker Tesla. His companies have billions of dollars of contracts with the transportation department and other federal agencies, and is overseen by regulators with whom Musk has repeatedly clashed over the years.\nGOP chairman shares news of Gaza war ceasefire deal at Rubio’s hearing\nSen. Jim Risch interrupted a line of questioning Wednesday during Rubio’s confirmation hearing for secretary of state to share the news that a ceasefire deal had been reached between Israel and Hamas.\n“Before we all celebrate, though, obviously we’re going to want to see how that is executed,” Risch said.\nRubio, who has been in the hearing the duration of the latest negotiations, said he had hoped it would come to that resolution.\nBondi refuses to answer whether she would seek to prosecute Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith\nBondi refused to answer whether she would seek to prosecute Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, who charged the president-elect with federal crimes in two separate criminal cases.\nBondi said she would not “answer hypotheticals,” adding: “No one has been prejudged.”\nSmith has long been the target of Trump’s fury over the cases accusing the Republican of conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Smith abandoned the two cases against Trump in November, citing the Justice Department policy not to prosecute sitting presidents.\nDemocrats have raised concerns about a Fox News appearance in 2023 in which Bondi said: “The prosecutors will be prosecuted - the bad ones.”\nWright stands by statement that he believes ‘wildfires are just hype’\nCalifornia Sen. Alex Padilla asked Chris Wright if he still believes “wildfires are just hype” since two massive blazes in Southern California have killed at least 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes.\n“You’ve written that the hype over wildfires is just hype to justify more impoverishment from bad government policies,” Padilla said. “And given the devastation that we’re currently experiencing in Los Angeles, do you still believe that wildfires are just hype?”\nWright, Trump’s energy secretary nominee, said he stood by his past comments. He then said climate change is real before Padilla cut him off.\nPadilla said, “tell that to the families of the more than two dozen lost in these fires and counting.”\nScientists say climate change means more frequent and intense wildfires, with drought-like conditions in the western United States more likely.\nProtestors interrupted Wright’s confirmation hearing multiple created_ats, one yelling that “LA is burning” and another shouting “I’m 18 years old and I want a future!”\nRubio says the president has option to use military force to stop Mexican drug cartels at the border\nTrump’s secretary of state nominee, Marco Rubio, carefully navigated a GOP question about whether he would support the use of military force on the southern border to stop Mexican drug cartels.\n“That’s an option the president has at his disposal. Obviously, it’s not one that is in the purview of the Department of State,” Rubio said in response to a question from GOP Sen. Dave McCormick.\nHe added that there’s a lot the U.S. can do “in close partnership with our allies in Mexico” to “confront this challenge.”\nBondi evades question asking if she characterizes Jan. 6 rioters as ‘hostages’ and ‘patriots’\nWhen asked whether she agrees with Trump’s characterization of the Jan. 6 rioters as “hostages” and “patriots,\" Bondi said she was not familiar with those comments, which the president-elect made repeatedly on the campaign trail.\nWhen pressed again on that question, Bondi repeated she was not familiar with it. Trump made a central part of his campaign an effort to rewrite the history of the Jan. 6 attack and downplay the violence that left more than 100 police officers injured.\nBondi dodges question on whether she’d uphold TikTok ban\nAsked by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., about whether she’d enforce a ban on the social media platform TikTok, Trump’s pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi, declined to answer.\n“That’s pending litigation,” Bondi replied.\nTikTok’s parent company is in litigation before the Supreme Court over whether a law passed by Congress in a bipartisan vote and signed by President Joe Biden will be upheld. The company has said that it would shutdown in the U.S. on Jan 19 to comply with the law.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump was critical of the social media app in the past but has recently made comments that are skeptical of a ban.\nRubio argues US must rebuild industrial base to reduce dependence on Chinese goods\nTo compete with China, Rubio argued that the efforts must start at home to rebuild its industrial base and to reduce U.S. dependence on Chinese goods and industrial supply chains. He urged action at home, or the U.S. could “wind up living in a world where much of what we depend on for our security, our health, our safety, and our economic prosperity, we’re largely depend on whether the Chinese allow us to have it or not.”\nHe signaled during the hearing that he would align with the president-elect not to restrict U.S. investments overseas, calling it “a pretty unfair relationship” if U.S. companies are restricted but the Chinese competitors are not.\nDuffy says US is falling behind in the race to develop self-driving, autonomous vehicles\nSean Duffy says that the U.S. risks falling behind other countries in the race to develop self-driving, autonomous vehicles if the federal government doesn’t come up with rules over the technology, leaving that up to the states as is currently the situation.\n“Without clear rules , or a patchwork of rules state by state, we put ourselves behind those countries that allow innovators” to develop the technology, said Duffy, Trump’s pick for transportation secretary.\nChinese automakers in particular are threatening US automakers in the field of autonomous vehicles. Elon Musk’s Tesla and other automakers are hoping the Trump administration will develop rules on a federal level to help speed development of the technology.\nRubio says he’s hopeful a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas can be concluded quickly\nAnd he said Gaza’s post-conflict future will require international cooperation to succeed.\nRubio, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, also told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he believed there are now opportunities for broader stability in the Middle East with recent developments in Lebanon and Syria.\n“I am hopeful that there is an agreement in place that will bring hostages back immediately,” Rubio said of potential for a Gaza agreement negotiators continue to hash out in Qatar. He said both the Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration should share credit for an eventual deal. “Credit to both the Biden administration and the Trump transition working side-by-side on helping this become about and I hope that comes about,” he said.\nOn the region more broadly, Rubio said “there are opportunities available now in the Middle East that did not exist 90 days ago.” He referred to a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and the ouster of President Bashar Assad in Syria.\n“There are now factors at play in the Middle East that I think we can build upon and may open the door to extraordinary and historic opportunities, not just to provide for Israel’s security, but ultimately begin to confront some of these other factors,” he said. “But these things, again, are going to be hard work, and they’ll require us to take advantage of those opportunities if they exist.”\nRatcliffe supports key government surveillance program that critics say violates personal privacy\nJohn Ratcliffe, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the CIA, said he supports a key government surveillance program that authorities say is vital to national security but that critics have said it violates personal privacy.\nDuring a confirmation hearing Wednesday, Ratcliffe told members of the Senate intelligence committee that he believes the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act provides essential information that can be used to prevent terrorist attacks and inform critical national security decisions. He called FISA an “indispensable national security tool.”\nRatcliffe’s view puts him at odds with critics who say FISA, particularly a section known as 702, goes too far in allowing federal authorities to collect without a warrant the communications of non-Americans located outside the country. If those individuals are communicating with Americans, those conversations could be swept up too.\nRatcliffe said rules in place are designed to ensure American’s privacy is protected.\n“Is it perfect? No,” Ratcliffe said. “It is critical, it is indispensable.”\nRubio affirmed his support for Taiwan, advocating for the ‘porcupine’ approach\nHe said “you want to make the cost of invading Taiwan higher than the benefit.”\nChina considers the self-governed island part of Chinese territory and vows to annex it by force if necessary. Rubio also during the hearing warned that China is a more formidable rival than the former Soviet Union because the country is a competitor in “every realm”, such as technology, industry, geopolitics and science.\nWould Bondi drop a criminal case if the president asked her to?\nBondi didn’t directly answer when asked what she would would do if the president asked her to drop a criminal case. Bondi said she didn’t believe that would ever happen.\n“If I thought that would happen, I would not be sitting here today,” she said.\nShe also deflected initially when asked what she would do if Trump ordered her to do something unethical or illegal. “I will never, speak on a hypothetical, especially one saying that the president would do something illegal,” she said. “What I can tell you is my duty, if confirmed, as the attorney general will be to the Constitution and the United States of America.”\nBut when pressed again, Bondi suggested she would resign if asked to do something improper.\n“I wouldn’t be a prosecutor, I wouldn’t be attorney general if anyone asked me to do something improper and I felt I had to carry that out,” Bondi said. “Of course, I would not do that. That’s one of the main things you learn when you’re a young prosecutor is to do the right thing.”\nRatcliffe promises not to politicize the CIA agency by requiring agents to show loyalty to Trump\nMembers of the Senate intelligence committee grilled Ratcliffe during a confirmation hearing Wednesday, asking whether the nominee would hire or fire employees based on their politics.\nThey also asked Ratcliffe to promise not to politicize the CIA’s work by targeting Trump foes or withholding intelligence that might displease the incoming president.\n“Will you or any of your staff impose a political litmus test for CIA employees?” asked Sen. Angus King, a Maine Independent.\n“No,” Ratcliffe answered.\n‘There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,’ Bondi says\nBondi has repeatedly defended Trump’s pick to become FBI director, Kash Patel, touting his law enforcement experience and calling him the “right person” to run the bureau at this created_at.\nLawmakers questioned Bondi about Patel’s list of officials he’s claimed are part of the so-called “deep state,” which critics have described as Patel’s “enemies” list.\nWhen asked whether Bondi would “enforce” such a list, Bondi responded: “There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice.”\nBondi vowed politics will play no part in her decisions as attorney general\n“I believe that the Justice Department must be independent and must act independently,” Bondi said. “The number one job is to enforce the law fairly and even handedly. And that’s what will be done if I am confirmed as the attorney general.”\nDemocrat have raised concerns about Bondi’s ability to lead a Justice Department that’s independent from the White House, given her longstanding political support of Trump.\nBondi said ‘no one is is above the law’\nThat came when she was pressed about remarks she made on TV claiming “the prosecutors will be prosecuted — the bad ones.”\nHer remarks have raised concerns among Democrats given Trump’s threats to use the agency to exact revenge on his perceived political opponents. Bondi is also echoing Trump’s claims that he was prosecuted by the Justice Department for political purposes.\n“They targeted Donald Trump,” launching countless investigations against him, she said. “That will not be the case if I am attorney general, I will not politicize that office.”\nWright promises to implement Trump’s “bold energy agenda”\nCEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, Wright is Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Energy. His nomination went before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for a confirmation hearing on Wednesday.\nDuring the hearing, he promised to implement President-elect Donald Trump’s “bold energy agenda to unleash energy security and prosperity.”\nThe centerpiece of Trump’s energy policy is “drill, baby, drill,” and he has pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats’ “green new scam” in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change when they are burned and greenhouse gases are released.\n“President Trump shares my passion for energy,” Wright said. “And if confirmed, I will work tirelessly to implement his bold agenda as an unabashed steward for all sources of affordable, reliable and secure American energy.”\nDemocratic Sen. John Hickenlooper called Wright an “unrestrained enthusiast for fossils fuels in almost every regard,” but noted that he studied nuclear, worked on solar energy, and is a scientist who is open to discussion.\nWright promotes the idea that more fossil fuel production can lift people out of poverty around the globe.\nSeveral committee members wished him a happy birthday. Wright appeared before the committee on his 60th birthday, surrounded by family and friends.\nRubio jokes with his colleagues\nAt the end of his opening statement, Rubio, who said it felt “surreal” to be on the other side of the Senate panel, asked for his colleagues’ support to become the next secretary of state, using a bit of humor.\n“Thank you and I hope I can earn your support, whether it’s because you believe I would do a good job, or because you want to get rid of me,” the Florida Republican said.\n“Either way, the results are the same,” Sen. James Risch, the GOP chair, joked back.\nOn Jan. 6 pardons, Bondi says she’d advise Trump ‘on a case by case basis’\nAttorney General nominee Pam Bondi says that if she is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump’s attorney general she will advise him “on a case by case basis” regarding his pledge to pardon defendants prosecuted for their involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.\nAsked by Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois if she believes that those defendants should be pardoned, Bondi said the pardons fall under the president. She did not say if she agreed with Trump’s pledge to pardon the rioters convicted of crimes related to the riot.\nThe rioters were Trump supporters trying to disrupt the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory. Many of them were convicted of harming police officers. “I condemn any violence on a law enforcement officer in this country,” Bondi said.\nRatcliffe promises lawmakers he is committed to expanding the agency’s work while protecting American civil liberties\n“I have always prioritized American civil liberties – something I will continue to do,” Ratcliffe told members of the Senate intelligence committee during a confirmation hearing Wednesday.\nRatcliffe said the U.S. faces a complicated series of threats posed by adversaries such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. He said technologies like artificial intelligence and the internet are giving them new opportunities and that U.S. spy agencies must innovate to meet the challenges.\n“Today we face what may be the most challenging national security environment in our nation’s history,” Ratcliffe said.\n‘Bilingual protests’\nAt Rubio’s confirmation hearing before Foreign Relations Committee, protesters in Spanish and English interrupted his opening statement, arguing about issues regarding the Middle East and Latin America.\nRubio, who would be first Latino Secretary of State if confirmed, joked, “I get bilingual protests which is kind of cool.”\nBondi asked if she can say Trump lost the 2020 election\nThe question came from Sen. Durbin, the top Democrat on the committee\nBondi said she accepts “of course, that Joe Biden is the president of the United States.” She later added: “Do I accept the results? Of course I do.”\nBondi supported Trump’s efforts to challenge the results of the 2020 race, traveling in the days after the election to Pennsylvania, where she claimed without providing evidence that there had been “cheating.”\nRubio says he’ll place America’s interest ‘above all else’\nRubio promised Wednesday to implement President-elect Donald Trump’s “America First” vision as secretary of state, vowing in his confirmation hearing that the incoming administration will forge a new path by placing American interests “above all else.”\n“Placing our core national interests above all else is not isolationism,” Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “It is the commonsense realization that a foreign policy centered on our national interest is not some outdated relic.”\nSean Duffy said he will make road safety a priority\nDuffy reached for the personal in assuring senators he’d make road safety a priority as head of the transportation department, noting that his wife was in a car crash that could have killed her.\n“This hits close to home because my wife survived a deadly head-on car crash, which profoundly shaped her life,” said Duffy in prepared remarks to senators whom he hopes will confirm his nomination as transportation secretary. “If confirmed, I will prioritize road safety, ensuring lives and families aren’t forever changed by preventable accidents.”\nRatcliffe received an introduction from former US Attorney General John Ashcroft\nAshcroft, a former Republican senator from Missouri, served as attorney general under President George W. Bush.\nAshcroft cited Ratcliffe’s work as a federal prosecutor in Texas and his work on national security issues as a Republican Congressman.\nAshcroft, who has worked with Ratcliffe as an attorney, said the CIA nominee is “tough but fair” and focused on upholding the Constitution.\n“I’ve seen him speak the unvarnished truth to those he works with and those he works for,” Ashcroft said. “He understands that the intelligence community exists to secure the liberty and freedoms of Americans.”\nThe hearing for Sean Duffy, Trump’s transportation secretary pick, has begun\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, opened confirmation hearing for transportation secretary, noting someone who’s likely to come up in questioning: Elon Musk.\n“Now Elon Musk has launched his car in space,” said Cruz, referring to fast changing technology the transportation secretary will oversee. “A new era in transportation and infrastructure is here.”\nSean Duffy, a former Wisconsin congressman, reality TV star, and Fox News host, is hoping to take over the transportation department that will oversee highways, railroads, airspace and several Musk companies, including his Tesla electric car company.\nRatcliffe would be the first person to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and CIA\nJohn Ratcliffe, a former Republican congressman from Texas, served as director of national intelligence during Trump’s first term. He’s now Trump’s pick to lead the CIA, the nation’s premier spy agency. Ratcliffe’s nomination went before the Senate Intelligence Committee for a confirmation hearing Wednesday.\nHis experience is likely to boost his chances in the Senate. Trump’s pick to be the next director of national intelligence, former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, faces a more challenging confirmation, as lawmakers from both parties have raised questions about 2017 visits to former Syrian President Bashar Assad, as well comments that support Russian propaganda about the war in Ukraine.\nThe GOP chairman sees Trump and Rubio as a team to end the Ukraine war\nIn his opening statements, Sen. Jim Risch, the Republican chair of the Foreign Relations committee, outlined the various objectives the new GOP majority in Washington has abroad, including ending the nearly three-year-long war between Russia and Ukraine.\n“I am confident that if anyone can end this war, it’s President Trump. And Marco is the right man to help ensure it is done in a way that guarantees security and stability for Ukraine, the U.S., and our allies, and prevents Russia from launching another war,” the Idaho lawmaker said.\nBondi touted her experience as Florida’s attorney general\nThat includes her efforts to combat human trafficking and opioid abuse.\nWhen she was the state’s top prosecutor, she framed pictures of victims of the opioid crisis that she was given by grieving parents, Bondi said.\n“Fentanyl is raging through our country and I will do everything I can to fight that,” she said.\nMarco Rubio, Trump’s Secretary of State pick, appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\nThe 53-year-old’s nomination process is expected to be the most seamless of Trump’s Cabinet picks and could be one of the few to receive near unanimous support from both sides of the aisle.\nBondi says she’ll ‘restore confidence and integrity’ to the Justice Department\nAnd she said she’ll end what she described as “weaponization” of the department. Bondi’s remarks echo those of Trump and other Republicans, who claim the Justice Department has been used for political purposes under the Biden administration.\nThe Justice Department brought two criminal cases against Trump, but also prosecuted President Biden’s son, Hunter, on gun and tax charges.\nLike Trump, Bondi said: “I believe we are on the ‘cusp of a New Golden age’ where the Department of Justice can and will do better if I am confirmed.”\nBondi says her priorities as attorney general would include prosecuting violent crime and gangs\nThose priorities would also include protecting the nation from terrorists and “addressing the overwhelming crisis at the border,” she said.\n“The Department of Justice must also return to defending the foundational rights of all Americans, including free speech, free exercise of religion, and the right to bear arms,” Bondi told the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nSen. Tom Cotton says US spy agencies must do a better job of responding to terrorism\nAs President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the CIA prepares to take questions from lawmakers, the new chairman of the Senate intelligence committee says America’s spy agencies need to do a better job responding to growing threats of terrorism.\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, said the nation’s intelligence officials often work in difficult, dangerous environments with little public recognition. But he said recent events like the attack in New Orleans show they must do more to identify threats before they turn lethal.\n“In these dangerous created_ats, our intelligence agencies haven’t anticipated major events or detected impending attacks,” Cotton said. “I could give other examples but suffice it to say we’re too often in the dark.... The CIA has neglected its core mission.”\nCotton’s comments came at the start of a confirmation hearing for John Ratcliffe, Trump’s nominee for CIA director. Ratcliffe served as director of national intelligence during Trump’s first term. He’s a former Republican member of Congress.\nThe committee’s top Democrat wants to know if Bondi can tell Trump ‘no’\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee says he wants to know whether Attorney General nominee Pam Bondi will be able to tell President-elect Donald Trump “no.”\nIllinois Sen. Dick Durbin says it’s critical that any attorney general nominee be “committed first and foremost to the Constitution and the American people — not the president and his political agenda.”\nDurbin noted that Trump has vowed to seek retribution against “the enemy within” and threatened to prosecute or jail some of his political opponents and that Bondi, the former Florida attorney general, has echoed those calls.\nGrassley says ‘change is desperately needed’ at the Justice Department\nHe listed a litany of complaints about the Justice Department under Attorney General Merrick Garland, including the criminal cases brought against Trump and the FBI’s search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.\nThe Justice Department abandoned the cases against Trump in November, citing the department’s policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. Grassley urged a swift confirmation of Bondi, saying her prosecutorial experience “speaks volumes about her character and her dedication to the rule of law.”\nRepublican Sen. Chuck Grassley says Bondi’s qualifications ‘speak for themselves’\nThe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee highlighted Bondi’s work as Florida attorney general, going after so-called “pill mills” and other initiatives. She became Florida’s first female attorney general in 2011, serving until 2019.\nThe confirmation hearing is getting underway for Trump’s attorney general pick, Pam Bondi\nBondi, a former Florida attorney general, corporate lobbyist and longcreated_at fixture in Trump’s orbit, is expected to face questions over her loyalty to Trump, given his threats to seek revenge on his perceived political enemies.\nToday’s Cabinet confirmation schedule\n9:30 a.m.: Pam Bondi, Justice Department The former Florida attorney general makes the first of two scheduled appearances before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She was Trump’s pick for attorney general hours after his first choice, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew from consideration. Gaetz was facing questions about a federal sex trafficking investigation and a House Ethics Committee inquiry into allegations that he paid for sex, including with a 17-year-old girl.\nBondi is a longcreated_at fixture in Trump’s orbit. The attorney general will be one of the most closely watched Cabinet members, given the concern among Democrats that Trump will look to bend the Justice Department to his will.\n10 a.m.: Sean Duffy, Transportation Department The former Wisconsin congressman who was also a co-host on Fox Business will be questioned by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. The department oversees pipelines, railroads, cars, trucks, airlines and mass transit systems, as well as funding for highways.\n10 a.m.: John Ratcliffe, CIA Ratcliffe, director of national intelligence for the final months of Trump’s first term, goes before the Senate Intelligence Committee. The former Texas congressman is in line to lead the nation’s premier spy agency, responsible for foreign covert operations and collecting data on U.S. adversaries.\n10 a.m.: Marco Rubio, State Department The Florida senator has served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is considering his nomination to be secretary of state. As head of the State Department, job, Rubio would oversee the U.S. foreign service, advise Trump on diplomatic appointments and conduct negotiations with foreign leaders on behalf of the administration.\n10 a.m.: Chris Wright, Energy Department\nThe fossil fuel executive, who has been one of the industry’s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change, appears before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The secretary oversees energy generation and use in the United States as well as the nation’s nuclear weapon stockpile. Wright would also join Burgum on the National Energy Council.\n1 p.m.: Russell Vought, Office of Management and Budget Vought, OMB director during Trump’s first term, goes before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Vought was closely involved with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for Trump’s second term that the Republican nominee tried to distance himself from during the campaign. The budget director oversee the building of the president’s budget and review of proposed regulations.\n"

    "text": "\nThe following information was released by Radio Free Asia:\nPhilippine officials have suggested that, in the face of grave aggression from China in the South China Sea, new legal action is not a matter of if, but when.\nJonathan Malaya, assistant director-general of the National Security Council, told a press briefing this week that, being pushed \"to the wall,\" Manila is considering all options including new international lawsuits.In 2013, the Philippines filed an arbitration case against China under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, the first created_at any nation had challenged China over its maricreated_at claims.\nThe case regarding the Philippines and China on the South China Sea is heard at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, the Netherlands, on July 7, 2015.(The Permanent Court of Arbitration)\nKnown as PCA Case No. 2013-19, it ended in 2016 in victory for the Philippines, with the arbitral tribunal ruling in favor of the Philippines on most of its submissions and rejecting China's claim of historic rights to vast areas in the South China Sea using the so-called nine-dash line on its maps.\nNearly 10 years on, China still refuses to accept the ruling despite it being final and binding for all parties concerned.\nDuterte renews efforts\nUnder former President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines and China appeared to have shelved the tribunal's decision, a loss of opportunity to those who wanted to promote a new legal framework for the South China Sea.\nYet there have been constant calls on the Philippine government since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took power to renew efforts to reinforce the ruling, including by filing new cases.\nPhilippine Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio holds a hard copy of his e-book \"The South China Sea Dispute: Philippine Sovereign Rights and Jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea\" that questions China's historic claim to most of the South China Sea, May 4, 2017, Makati city, East of Manila, Philippines.(Bullit Marquez/AP)\n\"I have recommended the filing of the following cases before an UNCLOS tribunal,\" said former Justice Antonio Carpio, part of the legal team that defended the Philippines' case in 2016. \"The first is compulsory arbitration over the overlapping claims in the continental shelf beyond the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines in the Spratlys.\"\nUNCLOS determines that a littoral country's exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, measures 200 nautical miles from the shore and the continental shelf may extend beyond the EEZ.\n\"The second case is compulsory arbitration for damages arising from the ramming by Chinese coast guard vessels of Philippine coast guard vessels,\" Carpio told Radio Free Asia, referring to a number of serious incidents over the last few years near disputed reefs including Sabina Shoal and Scarborough Shoal.\n\"And the third case is compulsory arbitration to establish the rules to govern fishing in Scarborough Shoal which the 2016 tribunal declared is a historic fishing ground of Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen,\" Carpio added.\nChina, which took de-facto control of Scarborough Shoal in 2012, has been accused of blocking Philippine ships from accessing the area and harassing them. The world's largest coast guard vessel 5901, China's 'Monster', has been operating inside the Philippines' EEZ almost constantly since the beginning of the year to exert control over the Scarborough Shoal area.\nSupport for UNCLOS\nBuilding upon the 2016 ruling under UNCLOS may be a smart move that could garner international support but a maricreated_at expert suggested that \"making greater use of the United Nations would expand Philippine options for arbitration.\"\nGreg Poling, director of the Asia Maricreated_at Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, wrote in a recent article that even though the U.N. cannot compel China to comply with the 2016 arbitral award \"the General Assembly would be able to pass nonbinding resolutions and, most importantly, forward the matter to the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion.\"\nPoling suggested that the Philippines could file with the General Assembly a resolution demanding compliance with the 2016 arbitration, which it would win. It could also file another resolution seeking an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on issues such as whether China's behavior violates international treaties, and it could win that, too.\nRELATED STORIES\nPhilippines on Chinese incursions: Not ruling out another South China Sea lawsuit\nPhilippines says China's 'monster' ship on a mission to intimidate\nPhilippines, US, Japan stage joint naval maneuvers in South China Sea\nHe argued that \"repeated losses in different international bodies would raise the costs of noncompliance and make a face-saving compromise progressively more attractive\" for China.\n\"International law is not self-enforcing,\" Poling said, adding that an arbitral victory is only useful if it could be used to rally international support, impose costs, and eventually compel at least partial compliance by the wrongdoing party.\n\"We have thought about submitting a resolution before the U.N. General Assembly,\" said former Justice Antonio Carpio. \"This needs prior lobbying for votes.\"\n\"It would be reckless to ask for a U.N. General Assembly vote unless you have a headcount of how many votes you will get,\" the legal expert said.\nBut that's when the Philippines' ally the United States and like-minded nations could come to its support, said Greg Poling.\n\"The U.S. should lobby other states to vote with the Philippines,\" he told RFA.\nEdited by Mike Firn.\n"

It said a Chinese navy helicopter was also deployed in the area.\nThe escalatory actions of these Chinese vessels and aircraft disregard Philippine and international laws, said the Philippines' national maricreated_at council, an inter-agency group tasked with upholding the country's interests at sea.\nChina should direct its vessels to desist from conducting illegal actions that violate Philippines' sovereign rights in its EEZ, it said in a statement.\nChina's embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China says the Scarborough Shoal is its territory and has accused the Philippines of trespassing.\nTensions between China and the U.S. ally the Philippines have escalated the past two years, with frequent run-ins between their coast guards in the South China Sea, which China claims sovereignty over almost in its entirety.\nThe statement came just hours after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had a virtual call with U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba where the three leaders discussed China's conduct in the South China Sea.\nChina's expansive claims overlaps with the EEZs of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.

    "text": "\nJAPAN will continue to provide security and official development assistance (ODA) to boost Philippine maricreated_at defenses, as the foreign ministers of both countries on Wednesday expressed concern about rising tensions in the South China Sea.\nTokyo would build on its trilateral cooperation with the Philippines and the US to maintain peace in the Indo-Pacific region, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya told a news briefing during his visit to Manila.\n“Japan strongly opposes any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo by force or build up tensions in the region,” he said in Japanese. “We strongly ask for easing of tensions.”\n“The issue over the South China Sea is a legitimate concern for the international community because it directly links to regional peace and stability,” he added.\nThis comes after a virtual trilateral summit between Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., outgoing US President Joseph R. Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru this week, in which they vowed to continue cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.\nIn 2016, a United Nations-backed arbitration court based in the Hague said China’s claim to nearly the entire South China Sea was illegal.\nChina has largely ignored the ruling, calling it void. Aside from the Philippines and China, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam also claim parts of the waterway.\n“We stressed the importance of adhering to international law, especially the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law on the Sea (UNCLOS),” Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique A. Manalo told the same briefing.\n“We will work together, leveraging our strengthened strategic partnership with other like-minded states including trilateral cooperation with the United States in preserving, upholding and defending the rules- based international order and in working for a free and open Indo-Pacific,” he added.\nMr. Iwaya was also set to meet with Mr. Marcos later on Wednesday.\nThe Philippine Senate in December concurred with the ratification of Manila’s reciprocal access agreement with Japan, which will ease the entry of equipment and troops for combat training and disaster response, smoothing military cooperation between Manila and Tokyo.\nJapan’s National Diet has yet to approve the military pact, which both countries signed in July.\nThe agreement is the first of its kind to be signed by Japan in Asia and coincides with increased Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea, where Beijing’s expansive claims conflict with those of several Southeast Asian nations.\nThe ratification of the pact also followed Japan’s move to provide P611 million worth of security assistance to the Philippines including radar systems, inflatable boats and other maricreated_at equipment.\nThe Philippines has a visiting forces agreement with the US and Australia. Tokyo, which hosts the biggest concentration of US forces abroad, has a similar deal with Australia and Britain, and is negotiating another with France.\n“As neighbors, we face similar challenges in our common pursuit of regional peace and stability,” Mr. Manalo said. “Thus, we are working together to improve resilience and enhance adaptive capacity in the face of the evolving geopolitical landscape in the Indo-Pacific region.”\nThe Philippine National Security Council on Tuesday accused China of intimidating Filipino fishermen near Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea and normalizing its “illegal presence” after Beijing sent its biggest coast guard ship into the Philippines’ 200-nautical-mile (370.4 kilometers) exclusive economic zone (EEZ).\nThe government of Mr. Marcos has filed 199 diplomatic protests against China, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs, including one over China’s deployment of its so-called monster ship near the coast of Zambales province.\nManila’s top diplomat also floated the idea to his Japanese counterpart of a general review of the Japan-Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement (JPEPA), but did not elaborate.\nPhilippine Trade Undersecretary Allan B. Gepty told reporters in December Manila was pushing a review of the trade pact to include rules that would consider developments in digital trade and a more forward- looking economic deal focused on innovation and technological development.\nThe JPEPA is the Philippines’ first bilateral free trade agreement, which entered into force in December 2008.\nJapan is the country’s third-largest export market and the third- largest source of imports. Total trade between the two reached $20.7 billion last year.\nHARRIS CALL\nMeanwhile, US Vice-President Kamala D. Harris on Tuesday spoke on the phone with Mr. Marcos to commit to maintaining strong bilateral ties, according to the presidential palace and the White House.\n“Indeed, and I will tell you from my first visit to Manila and our first conversation, it is extremely important to me and to the United States that we reaffirm the commitment to the defense of the Philippines including the South China Sea,” the US Vice-President said, based on a statement from the presidential palace in Manila.\n“I know there is bipartisan support within the United States Congress and within the US for the strength of this relationship and the enduring nature of it in terms of security, but again, prosperity and to your point of people-to-people ties,” Ms. Harris said.\nMr. Marcos told her Manila’s trilateral cooperation with Washington and Tokyo would “change the dynamics of the South China Sea and the Indo- Pacific region.”\nThe Philippines and China have been embroiled in repeated spats in the past few years over disputed features within Manila’s exclusive economic zone, sparking regional concerns about a miscalculation and escalation at sea.\nUnder President Joseph R. Biden, Washington reiterated that the treaty covers any attacks on Philippine vessels, personnel and other assets in the South China Sea and anywhere in the Pacific.\nIn April last year, Republican Senator Bill Hagerty and Democrat Senator Tim Kaine pushed a bill that increased US military aid to the Philippines to $500 million from $40 million over five fiscal years through 2029.\nThe Philippines, one of the weakest in the world in terms of military capability, is important to Washington’s efforts to push back against China, which claims the South China Sea almost in its entirety.\nIn a separate statement, the White House said Mr. Marcos and Ms. Harris vowed to continue cooperation between their countries on climate and clean energy, maricreated_at security and critical minerals and semiconductor supply chains.\n“The Vice-President affirmed the importance of continued defense of international rules and norms in the South China Sea in the face of provocations from the People’s Republic of China and noted the US must stand with the Philippines,” it said.\n"

    "text": "\nManila should consider setting up more joint military bases with Washington under their Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) as China levels up its encroachment on Philippine waters, according to security experts.\nPhilippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. should reconsider his rejection of calls to create more EDCA bases, said Joshua Bernard B. Espeña, who teaches international relations at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines.\n“Mr. Marcos should consider adding more EDCA sites to further enhance intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and force projection capabilities,” he said in a Facebook Messenger chat. “This is direly needed if Manila is serious about operationalizing the comprehensive archipelagic defense concept.”\n“We must develop more EDCA sites while there is still created_at,” he added.\nMr. Marcos in 2023 gave the US access to four more military bases under the EDCA. These were on top of the five bases that US troops had access to.\nMr. Marcos has since said his government has no plans to open more joint military bases.\nChina and the Philippines have been at loggerheads over disputed features in the South China Sea, Claims the waterway almost in its entirety.\nManila has accused China’s coast guard of aggression, while Beijing is furious over what it calls repeated provocations and territorial incursions.\nChina is expected to ramp up its “aggression” under its sweeping South China Sea claim this year, said Raymond M. Powell, a fellow at Stanford University’s Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation.\nBeijing asserts its sovereignty claim over the South China Sea through an armada of coast guard ships, despite a United Nations-backed court ruling in 2016 that voided its claim for being illegal.\n“China’s aggression in the West Philippine Sea is likely to only increase,” Mr. Powell said via Messenger chat. “It has shown both the will and capability to push its sovereignty claims.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately reply to a Viber message seeking comment.\nThe sea dispute between the Philippines and China started escalating in 2012 after a standoff at Scarborough Shoal, but tensions boiled as early as the 1990s when Beijing and Manila were engaged in a naval skirmish at Mischief Reef, according to US think-tank Council on Foreign Relations. The reef is just 250 kilometers off the major Philippine island of Palawan.\nBeijing would likely escalate its claim through “swarming methods” while leveraging diplomatic tactics and propaganda to strengthen its hold and legitimize its claim in the waterway, Mr. Espeña said.\nMORE SHIPS\nSetting up more joint bases with the US could result in “new airstrips, berthing areas, ports and logistic centers to sustain operations and cover the large swathe of the South China Sea,” he added.\n“At the strategic level, this may provide the Philippines with a thicker shield to defend itself and a sharper sword to draw against China,” he said.\nBut efforts to increase EDCA military bases should not be communicated in a manner that would antagonize China, said Chester B. Cabalza, founding president of Manila-based International Development and Security Cooperation.\nInstead, the bases should be a means to enhance interoperability between US and Philippine forces for the sake of “peace and order in the region,” he said via Messenger chat. “Otherwise, China will retaliate against our hawkish anti-Chinese defense policy. And it will become a vicious cycle of vengeful attitudes toward each other.”\nPhilippine authorities should also empower the Philippine Navy and Philippine Coast Guard to boost their presence in the South China Sea, said Don Mclain Gill, an international studies lecturer at De La Salle University in Manila.\n“Maricreated_at law enforcement agencies such as the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and Navy [need to be supported so they could] actually monitor and enforce our maricreated_at space,” he said in a voice message via Facebook Messenger.\nManila should acquire more ships to increase sea patrols within the country’s exclusive economic zone, he added.\nThe PCG is set to acquire 49 new ships from France and Japan by 2027, Commandant Ronnie Gil L. Gavan said last year. Two corvette warships and six offshore patrol programs are in the pipeline for the Navy acquisition, Rear Admiral Roy Vincent T. Trinidad said last month.\n“That would allow us to increase our patrols within our exclusive economic zone,” Mr. Gill said.\nThe Philippine government should “mix and match” its defense capabilities to better project deterrence, such as buying missile systems and investing in “asymmetric technologies,” he added.\nFrequent joint patrols and exercises with allies in “key flashpoint” areas are also needed to bolster Philippine presence in the South China Sea, a key conduit for $3 trillion of annual ship-borne trade, Mr. Gill said.\nUS President-elect Donald John J. Trump might be interested in consolidating forces in the South China Sea via the Philippines given his tough stance against Beijing and the assembly of China hawks in his cabinet, Mr. Espeña said.\n"

It's the primary diplomatic forum where Manila and Beijing address South China Sea tensions.\nThe last such talks were held in July 2024, when both parties reached a provisional arrangement on the Philippines' resupply missions to the BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal.\nAt the talks in Xiamen, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Theresa Lazaro raised \"serious concerns\" about CCG 5901 - China's 165-meter \"monster ship\" - and CCG 3103 operating within Philippine maricreated_at zones in violation of the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act and the United Nations Convention on the Law, according to the DFA statement.\nThe DFA said Lazaro and her counterpart in Beijing, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong, had \"frank and constructive discussions on the situation in the South China Sea and other bilateral issues. The statement did not mention any commitment from Beijing to end its nearly two-week presence near Zambales.\n\"Our position is clear and consistent, but so is our willingness to engage in dialogue. We firmly believe that despite the unresolved challenges and differences, there is genuine space for diplomatic and pragmatic cooperation in dealing with our issues in the South China Sea,' Lazaro said.\nChina's largest coast guard vessel - dubbed the \"monster ship\" - appeared off Zambales on January 4, setting off a two-week maricreated_at standoff in waters unusually close to Philippine shores. Two other Chinese vessels, CCG 3103 and CCG 3304, took turns patrolling just 70-90 nautical miles from the coastline, an area that hasn't previously seen such presence from the CCG.\nPhilippine authorities said they were surprised by Beijing's \"increasing aggression.\" They have tagged the presence of China's vessels as a clear act of escalation.\nThe PCG has since deployed its flagship vessel, the BRP Teresa Magbanua, to circle and attempt to drive off the CCG vessels.\nChina has defended its actions by claiming its CCG's patrols were being done in \"relevant waters, which is lawful, justified and beyond reproach.\"\nDuring the bilateral talks on Thursday, both sides also exchanged views on the earlier agreement reached regarding the resupply missions to BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal. The two countries' diplomats \"acknowledged its positive outcomes, and agreed to continue its implementation to sustain the de-escalation of tensions without prejudice to respective national positions,\" according to the DFA.\nBoth parties also \"agreed to reinvigorate the platform for coast guard cooperation\" and consider exploring ocean meteorology as an \"area of focus for a workshop on marine scientific cooperation.\"\n\"Undersecretary Lazaro underscored that President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. has emphasized the Philippines' commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue and diplomacy,\" the DFA said.\nThe meeting with the Chinese vice foreign minister was held in Xiamen, Fujian province - the ancestral hometown of several Chinese Filipinos. The Philippines will host the next round of consultations, though no date has been set.\nThe Philippines on Monday, January 13 filed another diplomatic protest against China over the activities of the CCG in its exclusive economic zone.\nBeijing has continued to press its claims to almost the entire South China Sea despite an international tribunal ruling in 2016 that nullified its claim of historic rights over the waters.\n"

We firmly believe that despite the unresolved challenges and differences, there is genuine space for diplomatic and pragmatic cooperation in dealing with our issues in the South China Sea,' Philippine delegation head Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro said in her opening remarks.\nAt the meeting, Lazaro expressed 'serious concern' with her Chinese counterpart, Vice Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong, about the presence of two ships of the Chinese Coast Guard - including the so-called 'Monster Ship' near the maricreated_at zones of the Philippines.\nThe two ships, with tail number 5901 and 3103, have been spotted by Canada's Dark Vessel Detection lingering some 60-90 nautical miles off Zambales since January 4. (See related story: \nThe Philippine panel insisted that the activities conducted by the two vessels were 'inconsistent with the 1982 Unclos (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) and the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act.'\nUnder the Unclos, all foreign ships may pass through the exclusive economic zones and territorial waters under the right of innocent passage on the condition that their presence do not prejudice the peace and order or security of the coastal state.\nThe Philippine government is alarmed that the movements of CCG 5901 near Zambales have not been 'continuous or expeditious.'\nAlso, CCG 5901 is considered the largest Coast Guard vessel in the world with a displacement of around 12,000 gross tons. This is why it got the monicker, 'Monster Ship' due to its enormous size.\nDespite the 2016 ruling by an international arbitration court, China still claims that the entire South China Sea as part of its territory.\nAside from the recent presence of the Monster Ship of China in the West Philippine Sea, both sides also reviewed the recent provisional understanding they had on the rotation and reprovision missions of the Philippine Armed Forces to the troops stationed at BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal.\nNoting the 'positive outcome' of the provisional arrangement, both Manila and Biejing 'agreed to continue its implementation to sustain the de-escalation of tensions without prejudice to respective national positions.'\nLazaro and Chen also agreed to 'reinvigorate' the platform for Coast Guard cooperation, the DFA said in a statement.\nBoth sides also identified ocean meteorology as a focus area for a workshop on marine scientific cooperation.\n'Undersecretary Lazaro underscored that President Ferdinand R.

    "title": "How China is driving up demand for India-made BrahMos",
    "created_at": "2025-01-16",
    "text": "\nMonths after the\nPhilippines received the first batch\n of India-made BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles in April, Indonesia is soon set to\nsign a USD 450-million deal\n to acquire the medium-range missiles. The deal with Indonesia would be India's biggest defence export agreement, and comes amid a surge in interest in the BrahMos. Other southeast Asian nations like Vietnam and Malaysia have also shown interest in the BrahMos, and the demand might have a China link. The spike in demand for the versatile BrahMos, a missile co-produced by an India-Russia joint venture, comes as these nations choose to arm their defence forces amid China's expanding influence and assertive military posturing in the South China Sea and the western Pacific Ocean. China's expansionist behaviour is what could be driving the demand for the India-made BrahMos. China's increasing aggressive territorial claims in the South China Sea based on\nits maricreated_at Nine-Dash line\n, its militarisation of artificial islands, and its increasing naval presence and random attacks have created a sense of unease among the neighbouring states. Because of this, the BrahMos missile is a highly-sought-after asset for military forces of the littoral states of the South China Sea, and is emerging as the cornerstone of India's defence exports. And by building up the muscles of these countries, India is, in a way, building its own muscles in the region, experts believe.   With its ability to be launched from land, sea, and air platforms, the BrahMos boasts a range of approximately 290 kilometres and a speed of Mach 2.8, making it a missile of choice for defence forces. Add to that India's growing naval power and its stand for peace and security in the Indian Ocean Region and its extended neighbourhood. For countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia, which have had historical disputes with China over maricreated_at territories, the BrahMos missile offers a credible deterrent. The missile's precision and speed make it an effective tool for defending against Chinese naval and land-based threats.\nBRAHMOS IS HELPING PHILIPPINES DEAL WITH CHINA THREAT   The Philippines, which\nbought the coastal battery variants of the BrahMos\n, now \"keeps the Chinese threat at least 300 km away\" from its coastline, according to Captain DK Sharma (retired), a former spokesperson of the Indian Navy. China's assertive behaviour on the high-seas is much like\nChina's territorial claims on parts of Indian territories\n in Ladakh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. It has also\nclaimed parts of Nepal and Bhutan\n. China's Nine-Dash line, an imaginary maricreated_at line in the South China Sea, forms the basis of such claims. Through this, China claims multiple islands that are in contention with the territorial interests of these countries. Between February 2023 and July 2024, the Philippines reported at least 12 instances of unsafe unprovoked military behaviour by China, often within the waters of its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), according to a 2024 report by think-tank International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). The Philippines, which has already received a consignment of BrahMos, is strengthening its military in the face of Chinese encroachment. The country's experience with Chinese aggression in the Scarborough Shoal and other disputed territories has shown the need for advanced weaponry to protect its sovereignty. INDONESIA BOLSTERING ARESNAL WITH BRAHMOS  Countries with BrahMos missiles would end up creating a security arc against China.   \"Look at the terrain. The extent of the sea in which the BrahMos missiles exported by India would be deployed is vast. There's the Philippines in the centre. You have got Indonesia below, and above on the arc, you have got Vietnam,\" Captain DK Sharma (retired), former spokesperson of the Indian Navy told India Today TV. Indonesia, in particular, has also been bolstering its military arsenal in response to China's growing presence in the South China Sea under the leadership of President Prabowo Subianto, who is\nlikely to be India's chief guest for the Republic Day ceremony\n. It may be during this visit that both nations ink the deal. The potential deal for BrahMos missiles is seen as a strategic move to enhance Indonesia's defence capabilities, especially in light of the country's geographic vulnerability with its extensive archipelago. \"Under President Prabowo Subianto, there is perhaps an attempt to pick up the pace. Indonesia needs to have a very powerful maricreated_at capability to assert itself as a powerful maricreated_at nation,\" Commodore (retired) Anil Jai Singh told India Today TV. \"From Indonesia's perspective, as a strategically located nation, it provides a gateway between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. All three chokepoints, Malacca, Sunda, and Lombok, are in Indonesian waters. China, in an attempt to push its footprint westwards, has been troubling Indonesia by encroaching on its special economic zone. As an archipelagic state, Indonesia has a huge SEZ, and it is very difficult for it to patrol its region the entire created_at,\" added Commodore Anil Jai Singh (retired). IN BRAHMOS DEALS, INDIA HAS STRATEGIC INTEREST IN MIND   India's success in exporting the BrahMos missile is not only a testament to the technological and commercial prowess of its defence industry, but also reflects the country's growing role as a reliable partner in regional security. India sees the\nIndian Ocean region as its strategic backyard\n, and peace and stability in the extended region is its priority, under its SAGAR doctrine. So, for India, BrahMos missile deals are much more than defence exports. \"By building up Indonesia's muscle, India is, in a way of speaking, also building up its own muscle in the region,\" senior fellow at think tank ORF Sushant Sareen told India Today TV. \"India is now looking to play the game as it needs to be played,\" he added.\nThe surge in demand for the BrahMos coincides with India's defence exports reaching an all-created_at high. From exporting defence equipment worth Rs 686 crore in FY 2013-14, India has made significant strides, achieving exports worth Rs 21,083 crore in FY 2023-24, according to Ministry of Defence data. \"India's 'Look East' policy evolved into 'Act East', and assertiveness is at play in this approach,\" said Commodore Anil Jai Singh (retired). As India continues to expand its defence exports, including the sale of the BrahMos to friendly neighbours, it is likely to attract more countries seeking to counterbalance the influence of an assertive China. And in doing so, China and its posture is contributing to driving demand for the BrahMos.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nHow China is driving up demand for India-made BrahMos\n"

The OPV construction is fully funded by Japan through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).\nWhile specific details regarding the main defense equipment technologies involved in the transfer were not disclosed, Japan has recently suggested a joint development of the Mogami-class frigate.\nPresident Prabowo and PM Ishiba led their respective delegations to a bilateral meeting at the Bogor Palace, attended by ministers and high-ranking officials from both countries. This meeting was part of PM Ishiba and his wife Yoshiko Ishiba's state visit to the Bogor Palace.\nPresident Prabowo and PM Ishiba also met one-on-one at the presidential office.\nAccording to the AFP news agency, Japan will give Indonesia two high-speed patrol boats, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Jan. 11, as Tokyo seeks to boost regional maricreated_at security cooperation in the face of competing territorial claims with China.\nIshiba made the pledge during a visit to Jakarta, where he held talks with President Prabowo Subianto on a range of bilateral issues.\n\"We agreed on establishing working-level defense consultations on our maricreated_at security, including on defense equipment technical cooperation,\" the AFP reported quoting Ishiba as saying in a joint statement.\n\"We also agreed to [...] provide high-speed patrol boats through Official Security Assistance, which would be our first with Indonesia.\"\nHe said the two countries also agreed to cooperate in decarbonized energy sectors, such as geothermal power, hydrogen, ammonia and biofuels.\nBefore arriving in Jakarta, Ishiba held talks in Kuala Lumpur with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, describing strengthening ties with Southeast Asia as \"one of the biggest priorities\" for Japan.\nThe trip, he said, made him aware of the \"explosive growth of Japan to give Indonesia high-speed patrol boats in security deal The prime minister's trips to Malaysia and Indonesia mark Ishiba's first official state visit since taking office in October.\n\"Diplomatic engagement in this region is as extremely important to Japan as it is to the United States\", the AFP reported quoting Ishiba as saying.\n\"I would like to share the understanding with [...] Trump that Japan and the U.S. working together towards the peace and stability of this region will contribute significantly to the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region and the whole world,\" he continued referring to U.S. president-elect Donald Trump.\nWith U.S. encouragement as it seeks to counter China, Japan has been deepening security ties in the region. China claims almost all of the South China Sea despite an international ruling in 2016 concluding its claims have no legal basis. But China rejected the 2016 PCA (Permanent Court of Arbitration) ruling.\nHuge unexploited oil and gas deposits are believed to lie under the South China Sea, though estimates vary greatly. Last month, Japan's top diplomat Takeshi Iwaya expressed \"serious concerns\" to his Chinese counterpart over Beijing's increasing military activity, and also cited worries over the \"East China Sea situation, including around the Senkaku Islands\", a chain of uninhabited islands claimed by Beijing but administered by Tokyo.\nJapan is already providing equipment and other assistance to the Philippines, which is also engaged in territorial disputes with China.\nLast year the Philippines ratified a key defense pact with Japan, which allows them to deploy troops on each other's soil.\nBy increasing defence cooperation with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, Japan wants to make them ready against aggressive China in the South China Sea.\n"

    "text": "\n It could easily be dismissed as a pro forma farewell call by the outgoing leader of the United States, but President Joe Biden's reassurance of continued American support must still hold water for allies facing China's intimidation in the disputed South China Sea, particularly in Philippine waters.\nBiden held a video conference call with President Marcos and Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Monday, a week before he steps down and transfers power to his successor, president-elect Donald Trump. The call, he said, was meant to 'advance our cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.'\nThe White House statement on the phone call said the three leaders 'discussed trilateral maricreated_at security and economic cooperation, as well as the People's Republic of China's dangerous and unlawful behavior in the South China Sea.' The three, it added, 'agreed on the importance of continued coordination to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific.'\nPresident Biden was 'optimistic' that his successor would see the value of continuing US partnership with the Philippines and Japan, the US embassy in Manila added. Both the Philippines and Japan are in conflict with China over the latter's sweeping claims of vital regional waters.\nBolder intrusion\n'Simply put, our countries have an interest in continuing this partnership and institutionalizing our cooperation across our governments so that it is built to last,' Biden said, with Marcos and Ishiba sharing his optimism.\nBut these warm ties and commitment to fend off China's aggression in the South China Sea are rendered almost futile by the continued presence of Chinese ships in the West Philippine Sea, in direct contravention of the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration nullifying China's claims over areas within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\nChina's coast guard ships and militia vessels continue to swarm shoals and islands in the West Philippine Sea, intimidating the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and driving away Filipino fishermen from their traditional fishing grounds, even as the Philippines has been strengthening its security alliances with the US, Japan, and other western countries vehemently opposing China's actions.\nOf utmost concern is the bolder intrusion of China Coast Guard 5901, dubbed the 'monster ship' for its gigantic size, in the country's territorial waters this month and several created_ats last year.\nAlarming scenario\nAt 12,000 ton, the CCG 5901 is said to be the largest coast guard ship in the world and is five created_ats bigger than the PCG's biggest ships. The 165-meter ship is reported to be armed with anti-aircraft guns and can stay at sea for up to 45 days.\nSecurity analyst Ray Powell reported that the monster ship arrived on Jan. 1 near the Scarborough Shoal to boost China's claim over the area which it seized during a standoff with the Philippines in 2012. The monster ship, which came as close as 100 kilometers off Capones Island in Zambales, left on Wednesday after being challenged by the PCG, but returned on Jan. 4. As of Sunday, the ship was seen some 176 km off Zambales' coast.\n'Their goal is to normalize such deployments, and if these actions go unnoticed and unchallenged, it will enable them to alter the existing status quo,' PCG spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela said on Sunday.\nThat is indeed the alarming scenario should China's latest move remain feebly protested. Having lost Scarborough, and with its arbitral victory ignored and trampled upon by its giant neighbor, the Philippines must not allow China - through its behemoth ship - to gain any more foothold in the country's waters.\nFreedom of navigation\nApart from maintaining its coast guard ships in the West Philippine Sea, the Philippine government should operationalize all security arrangements that purport to strengthen the country's defense and claim of its territorial rights, and protect the freedom of navigation in this crucial international waterway.\nIt is created_at to put to the test those verbal commitments for ensuring a 'free and open Indo-Pacific' region by translating them into action that would deter and prevent any act of escalation in the West Philippine Sea. What's the use of all those enhanced defense cooperation agreements with the US and a new reciprocal access agreement with Japan if such blatant intrusion deeper into the Philippines' coastal waters were left unchallenged?\nMr. Marcos has the moral and legal imperative, as well as crucial international support, to make a stronger move to stop this latest mockery of our sovereignty by repelling China's monster ship off our waters.\nAfter all, didn't he promise quite unequivocally back in 2023 that the country 'will not lose an inch of territory' in the West Philippine Sea? It's created_at to redeem that promise, and soon. Because if the situation continues without any concrete action countering it, we might as well resign ourselves to losing another Scarborough and more to China.\n"

    "text": "\nThe Indian military released a video on Wednesday showing two \"game-changing\" cruise missiles, which can strike enemy targets precisely, that were fired in rapid succession.\nWhy It Matters\nIn last April, India, which has a disputed border with China, delivered the supersonic anti-ship and land-attack missile BrahMos to the Philippines, a South China Sea country that has clashed with China over maricreated_at features claimed by both sides. Manila described the acquisition as a \"significant game-changer.\"\nWhat To Know\nThe BrahMos is capable of flying at nearly three created_ats the speed of sound and launching from ships, land, and aircraft, according to its manufacturer, BrahMos Aerospace, which is a joint venture between India and Russia.\nIn the video provided by the Western Command of the Indian army, the BrahMos missiles were fired from a land-based launcher at an undisclosed location, flying toward the ocean one after another. The Indian army said that it was a \"perfect salvo launch\" of missiles.\nThe mulcreated_atdia digital platform The New Indian said a salvo launch is designed to overwhelm enemy defenses, ensuring higher mission success rates. The launch served as a deterrent, signaling India's readiness to neutralize threats with precision strikes, it added.\nThe daycreated_at launch validated the missile's \"capability of the formation\" to engage targets deep into enemy territory with what it called \"clinical precision,\" the Indian army wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter), which also came with a tag, \"No Target Too Deep.\"\nThe BrahMos has a stated range of 290 kilometers (180 miles) for its baseline version, while its extended variant has an estimated range between 450 and 500 kilometers (279 to 310 miles).\nThe Indian navy launched two warships and one submarine on the same day, highlighting New Delhi's strategic focus in the Indian Ocean, an area that it views as its backyard, amid China's expanding naval presence far away from the country's shores.\nBesides the Philippines, Vietnam is poised to become the second country to acquire the BrahMos. Hanoi has protested over China's actions in the Gulf of Tonkin, located between two nations, and over reported assaults on Vietnamese fishermen in the South China Sea.\nThe Chinese Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhat People Are Saying\nBrahMos Aerospace said in a post on X: \"Congratulations to [the Western Command] of [the Indian Army] for the spectacular #SalvoLaunch of #BRAHMOS Supersonic Cruise #Missile, showcasing weapon's unparalleled firepower, infused with indigenous technologies to precisely hit targets deep into enemy territory.\"\nIndian news channel Republic TV reported: \"This successful launch reaffirms the Indian Army's readiness and ability to respond decisively to any potential threats, strengthening its position as a formidable force in the region.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nIndia is likely to conduct further tests of the BrahMos to demonstrate its long-range strike capabilities as China has expanded its ballistic missile force, which can hit targets in India.\nLink to Image\n\nGraphic\n \nIndian Army Launches BrahMos Supersonic Cruise Missile\nIndian army\nIn this image provided by the Western Command of the Indian army on January 15, 2025, a BrahMos supersonic cruise missile is fired from a land-based launcher at an undisclosed location.

    "created_at": "2025-01-16",
    "text": "\n Tensions between Beijing and Tokyo have been steadily escalating in recent years, with Japan's foreign minister expressing deep concerns over China's increasing military assertiveness.\nThis growing friction stems from a series of geopolitical flashpoints, including territorial disputes, economic restrictions, and the detention of a Japanese national, alongside broader regional anxieties over China's activities near Taiwan and the Philippines.\nThese developments underscore the fragile state of relations in the Indo-Pacific and highlight the challenges to regional stability from Chinese aggression. Japan and China share a complex history marked by periods of conflict, cooperation, and competition.\nIn recent decades, their relationship has been shaped by territorial disputes, particularly over the Senkaku Islands (referred to as Diaoyu by China) in the East China Sea.\nThis long-standing disagreement has been a persistent source of tension, with both nations asserting sovereignty over the uninhabited islands, which are surrounded by resource-rich waters and vital shipping lanes.\nThe post-World War II period saw Japan adopting a pacifist constitution, refraining from building a largescale military force.\nHowever, China's rapid military expansion and assertive actions in the region have prompted Tokyo to rethink its defence policies. shift has been particularly evident in recent years, as Japan has taken steps to bolster its military capabilities and strengthen alliances with like-minded nations.\nEconomic tensions have added another layer to the strained relationship. China's ban on Japanese seafood imports, imposed in response to Tokyo's release of treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant, has drawn criticism from Japanese officials.\nBeijing's move not only disrupted Japan's seafood exports but also signalled China's willingness to leverage economic tools in geopolitical disputes. Japan's foreign minister has called the ban 'unjustified' and emphasised the safety of the wastewater release, which has been validated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nTokyo's frustration is compounded by the perception that China's actions are part of a broader strategy to exert economic pressure and influence. Diplomatic relations were further strained by China's detention of a Japanese businessman earlier this year on allegations of espionage.\nWhile the specifics of the case remain unclear, it has fueled unease in Japan and raised questions about the safety of Japanese nationals operating in China.\nTokyo has called for transparency and the immediate release of its citizen, but Beijing has remained firm, citing its legal procedures.\nThis incident has added to the mistrust between the two nations and heightened the perception of China's increasingly authoritarian approach to internal and external challenges. Japan's concerns are not confined to its bilateral issues with China.\nBeijing's growing military activities around Taiwan and the Philippines have further amplified regional anxieties.\nThe frequent incursions by Chinese military aircraft and naval vessels into Taiwan's air defence identification zone (ADIZ) are seen as provocative actions aimed at intimidating the self-governed island, which Beijing considers a breakaway province. Japan views stability in the Taiwan Strait as critical to its security and economic interests.\nThe proximity of Taiwan to Japan's southernmost islands makes any escalation of tensions in the area a direct threat to Tokyo.\nIn recent statements, Japanese officials have reiterated their commitment to peace and stability in the region, emphasising the importance of international cooperation to counterbalance China's assertiveness. Meanwhile, China's activities in the South China Sea, including near the Philippines, have also drawn international criticism.\nBeijing's militarisation of artificial islands and harassment of Philippine vessels underscore its broader ambitions in the region.\nThese actions have led to closer defence ties between Japan and the Philippines, as both nations seek to enhance their capabilities to counter shared security challenges.\nIn response to China's growing military activities, Japan has taken several steps to strengthen its defence posture and regional alliances.\nTokyo has increased its defence budget, with plans to double it over the next five years, reflecting a significant shift in its post-war pacifist stance.\nThe funds will be used to modernise Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF), enhance missile defence systems, and develop new capabilities such as cyber and space defence. Japan has also deepened its security partnerships with key allies, including the United States, Australia, and India.\nThe Quad grouping, comprising these four nations, has emerged as a cornerstone of Japan's strategy to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific. Regular joint military exercises and defence technology collaborations are further strengthening these ties.\nIn addition, Japan has been working to expand its partnerships with Southeast Asian nations, recognising the shared concerns about China's actions in the South China Sea.\nTokyo's support for infrastructure development and capacity-building in the region is part of a broader effort to counterbalance Beijing's influence.\nFrom Beijing's standpoint, its military activities and economic measures are framed as defensive responses to perceived threats from the United States and its allies, including Japan. Chinese officials have accused Tokyo of aligning too closely with Washington and escalating tensions by increasing its military spending and participating in joint drills. China's assertiveness is also driven by its longterm goal of reunifying Taiwan with the mainland.\nWhile Beijing insists that its actions are aimed at safeguarding territorial integrity and regional stability, they are widely viewed as destabilizing by its neighbours.\nThe United States' role in the region is a critical factor in the Japan-China dynamic.\nWashington's security alliance with Tokyo, established under the U.S.-Japan Mutual Security Treaty, remains the cornerstone of Japan's defence strategy.\nThe U.S.\nHas also increased its military presence in the Indo-Pacific, conducting freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea and bolstering ties with regional allies.\nWhile the U.S.\nHas consistently affirmed its commitment to defending Japan and supporting Taiwan, its actions have also drawn sharp criticism from Beijing. China views the U.S. presence as an attempt to contain its rise and undermine its sovereignty.\nThe growing tensions between Japan and China highlight the complexities of navigating a rapidly changing geopolitical landscape in the Indo-Pacific. Japan's foreign minister's concerns over China's military activities reflect not only bilateral issues but also broader regional dynamics involving Taiwan and the Philippines.\nAs both nations grapple with these challenges, the path forward will depend on a delicate balance of deterrence, diplomacy, and dialogue.\n"

Their return could easily be permitted by the UK unilaterally and does not depend on a deal with Mauritius. Second, leasing back Diego Garcia alone ignores the fact that there are other islands and reefs in the Chagos archipelago. Given the activities of the Chinese in establishing military bases on reefs in the South China Sea the security risk is obvious.

    "title": "Jimmy Carter: Protecting refugees and human rights",
    "created_at": "2025-01-16",
    "text": "\nBy Susan Martin\nJournal contributor\nFormer President James Earl Carter lived and died with dignity. An underestimated president, Carter gave much to the American people and even more to millions overseas who faced persecution and human rights abuses at home. I had the honor of serving in the Carter administration as research director for the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy. I observed his leadership — and some of the problems he experienced — in formulating and implementing policies related to asylum and refugee resettlement. His successes and failures provide lessons for the future.\nIn 1979, record numbers of refugees exited Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos by land and sea, on the way to Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and the Philippines. Thailand and Malaysia, in particular, took action to prevent entry into their countries at the same created_at that pirates in the South China Sea began to target and often kill boat people, as the refugees were called.\nRecognizing a crisis in the making, the United States called for an international conference to find solutions. President Carter sent Vice President Walter Mondale to Geneva to chair the conference. He had the authority to commit the United States to admit 14,000 refugees per month (168,000 per year) as needed. This led to significant pledges from Canada, Australia, France, Britain and other countries. That rate of resettlement convinced the neighboring countries to keep their borders open and allow aid organizations to operate in the refugee camps they set up. Vietnam pledged to institute an orderly departure program so that refugees would not need to risk their lives in the South China Sea. A new system for rescuing boat people at sea was also put in place. Thousands of lives were saved from this holistic approach.\nWhile addressing the crisis in Southeast Asia, President Carter worked with members of Congress — in particular Senator Edward Kennedy — to adopt the Refugee Act of 1980. The Act adopted a new definition of refugees and asylum seekers that comported with and even went beyond the UN Convention on the Status of Refugees. Refugees were defined as people fleeing a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group and political opinion. The legislation applied not only to those who had already fled their countries of origin but also to those still in these countries who otherwise met the definition. The legislation gave priority for admission to refugees of \"special humanitarian concern\" to the United States. The President had the authority to determine how many refugees would be admitted each year after consultation with Congress. The legislation included a special process for exceeding that number in case of emergencies mid-year. The law also created a system for providing assistance to refugees who were admitted and the role of state governments and nonprofit organizations in providing that aid.\nBefore the Refugee Act could be fully implemented, a new crisis emerged with the Mariel Boatlift. Discontent with conditions in Cuba had been brewing for years. The airlift that had allowed thousands of Cubans to come to the United States had ended. Fidel Castro had a history of opening the so-called floodgates to embarrass the United States while getting rid of potential dissidents, criminals and those with serious mental health problems. Within a few weeks, about 125,000 Cubans entered the United States, many on boats sent by relatives in Miami. In a speech at a League of Women Voters convention, President Carter promised to \"provide an open heart and open arms to refugees seeking freedom from Communist domination and from economic deprivation, brought about primarily by Fidel Castro and his government.\" As the number of arrivals grew along with complaints from Florida and beyond about the newcomers, the administration took action to curb movements. The political damage could not be undone, however. Along with high inflation, the hostages in Iran and other issues, immigration became a major roadblock to President Carter's reelection.\nAs the country mourns the death of Jimmy Carter, many have spoken about his commitment to human rights. His compassion and concern for the rights of the most vulnerable only grew after his presidency. As recently as 2022, he issued a statement with his wife, Rosalynn, that epitomized his views on refugees: \"Our nation has long been a beacon of hope for those fleeing violence or persecution. As honorary co-chairs of Welcome. US, we urge Americans to open their hearts to these refugees and support them as they work to build new lives here among us. We stand with the people of Ukraine in their courageous fight for democracy and freedom.\" President Carter was willing to risk his presidency to do the right thing for those in need. He will be missed.\nCopyright 2025 Journal of the San Juans\n"

    "title": "The Philippines-US Alliance: The Biden Legacy – OpEd",
    "created_at": "2025-01-16",
    "text": "\nOn January 14, 2025, U.S. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. delivered his final address at U.S. Department of State. Echoing his past statements, President Biden declared that the world is at an \"inflection point\" and that the \"Cold War period is over, and a new era has begun.\" This new era is underpinned by a \"fierce competition\" primarily between Washington and Beijing. President Biden underscored that that the U.S. is \"winning the worldwide competition...America is stronger, our alliance are stronger, our adversaries and competitors are weaker.\"\nMr. Biden's remarks were in part delivered to consolidate his foreign policy legacy as the 46th President of the United States. As he leaves the White House, it might be worth looking into his administration's record in dealing with the Philippines-U.S. alliance, the oldest of Washington's bilateral alliances in East Asia.\nRepairing Ties\nPresident Biden came into office in January 2021 at one of the lowest points in the history of the Philippines-U.S. alliance. Nearly a year before, then-Philippine President Rodrigo R. Duterte declared the abrogation of the 1998 Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), a crucial pact which provides the legal basis and framework for the presence and treatment of U.S. forces in the country. The abrogation of the VFA was the culmination of Mr. Duterte's efforts to upend Philippine foreign. After all, President Duterte was vocal about his desire to \"separate\" from the U.S. and \"realign\" the Philippines with China.\nThe VFA is an important component of the Philippines-U.S. alliance which is anchored on the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT). Under the latter, Manila and Washington agreed to \"act to meet the common dangers in accordance with its constitutional processes\" in the event of an \"armed attack in the Pacific Area.\" The allies also agreed to \"develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.\" These provisions of the MDT can fully be implemented if Washington has military presence in the Philippines.\nIn other words, the VFA operationalizes the Philippines-U.S. alliance, which is but part of a broader network of U.S.-led system of alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region. Without the VFA, the Philippines-U.S. alliance would largely be an alliance only in paper. Thus, there was strategic imperative for the Biden administration to restore stability in the Philippines-U.S. alliance.\nAt the start of its term, the Biden administration adopted what was already becoming a bipartisan consensus in Washington - the strategic competition with China. Indeed, the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance, issued within just two months into Mr. Biden's term, provided that China is the \"only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system.\"\nOwing in part to its geographical location, the Philippines was (and is) a key actor in the evolving regional power balance. As such, the Biden foreign policy team needed to move quickly to repair the alliance with Manila. Fortunately for the Biden administration, there three major developments which helped persuade President Duterte to reconsider his decision to withdraw from the VFA.\nFirst, the Whitsun Reef incident of March 2021 when the Philippine government expressed concern over the presence of more than 200 hundred fishing vessels manned by Chinese maricreated_at militia. This incident, which led to a \"terse exchange of statements\" between Manila and Beijing, provided an opportunity for the Biden administration to express its support for the Philippines, as well as to reaffirm the public commitment that the MDT is also applicable in the South China Sea.\nSecond, by its final full year in office, the Duterte administration has little to show for the supposed major infrastructure projects from China. This in turn strengthened the position of those who have strong reservations about Duterte's foreign policy, including the Philippine defense establishment which has close historical links with the U.S.\nThird, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. donation of much needed vaccines. Philippine Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez convinced President Duterte to reconsider his decision to end the VFA in light of the health and other challenges caused by the pandemic. Subsequently, Mr. Duterte himself admitted publicly that he \"conceded the continuance of the Visiting Forces Agreement, in gratitude\" for the vaccines provided by Washington.\nThus, when U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III visited the Philippines in July 2021, the Philippine government announced President Duterte decided to fully restore the VFA. Malacañang announced that President Duterte and Secretary Austin had \"open and frank discussion on the status and future direction of Philippines-U.S. engagement.\" They agreed that the \"alliance can be further strengthened through enhanced communication and greater cooperation.\"\nSeizing Opportunities \nThe restoration of the VFA provided some measure of stability in the security relations between Manila and Washington. However, it was the Philippine presidential transition in 2022 that provided the Biden administration the opportunity to reinvigorate the alliance with Manila.\nAlthough initially perceived to continue the \"Pivot to China\" initiative of the Duterte administration, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. shifted course in foreign policy. Indeed, in his speech at the 77th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) barely three months into his term, Mr. Marcos declared that \"[b]y reinforcing the predictability and stability of international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, [the Philippines] provided an example of how states should resolve their differences: through reason and through right.\" President Marcos reaffirmed the 2016 Arbitral Tribunal Award which his predecessor has dismissed a mere \"piece of paper\" which he would \"just throw away.\"\nIn a stark departure from Mr. Duterte's vocal anti-American tendencies, President Marcos, in his first bilateral meeting with President Biden at the sidelines of the 77th UNGA, declared that the Philippines \"continue to look to the United States for that continuing partnership and the maintenance of peace in our region.\"\nSeizing the opportunities, the Biden administration achieved major strides in strengthening the Philippines-U.S. alliance. First, the expansion of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Signed in 2014, EDCA provides for the increased rotational presence of U.S. forces in the Philippines. As an implementing agreement of the MDT and VFA, EDCA also seeks to promote interoperability and support the AFP modernization program by identifying \"agreed locations\" in which the U.S. military is authorized to, among others, deploy forces and materiel, train, and preposition equipment and supplies. In 2016, the allies announced the initial five EDCA locations: Basa Air Base in Pampanga; Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija; Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan; Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base in Cebu; and Lumbia Air Base in Cagayan de Oro.\nIn 2023, the Biden administration brokered a deal with the Marcos government for the \"full implementation\" of EDCA. This entailed the addition of four new EDCA sites in addition to the original five: Naval Base Camilo Osias in Santa Ana, Cagayan; Camp Melchor Dela Cruz in Gamu, Isabela; Balabac Island in Palawan; and Lal-lo Airport in Cagayan. The strategic location of the bases may suggest that the allies are not just forging closer security cooperation in the context of the West Philippine Sea (WPS), but also of Taiwan.\nSecond, the agreement on the Bilateral Defense Guidelines (BDG). With the aim of promoting better alliance management, the BDG aims to, among others, foster \"a common understanding of roles, missions, and capabilities within the framework of the alliance to face emerging regional and global security challenges.\" Anchored on previous U.S. private assurances and public declarations, the BDG provides that an \"armed attack in the Pacific, to include anywhere in the South China Sea [SCS], on either Philippine or U.S. armed forces - which includes both nations' Coast Guards - aircraft, or public vessels, would invoke mutual defense commitments under Article IV and Article V of the MDT.\"\nCognizant of China's coercion below the threshold of armed conflict, the BDG underscores the need to \"build interoperability and cooperation in both conventional and non-conventional domains while taking into account asymmetric, hybrid, and irregular warfare and gray-zone tactics as well as artificial intelligence and other emerging technology areas.\" Moreover, mindful of the historical asymmetry that characterized Philippines-U.S. alliance, the BDG provided guidance in order to promote a more equal relationship, including alliance coordination and bilateral planning.\nThird, the signing of the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA). The agreement will serve as a \"framework to facilitate the exchange of classified military information between the Philippines and the United States.\" Manila also announced that GSOMIA will \"allow the Philippines access to higher capabilities and big-ticket items from the United States [and ] also open opportunities to pursue similar agreements with like-minded nations.\" At the created_at when GSOMIA was signed, the allies also broke ground on a new combined coordination center at Camp Aguinaldo, the center of the Philippine defense establishment.\nThe Biden administration also saw an expansion of military training exercises and aid to the Philippines. Indeed, the 2024 Balikatan Exercises - the last under the Biden administration - was the largest thus far, with about 16,000 American and Philippine military personnel who participated. With the participation of other like-minded partners like Australia and France, the 2024 Balikatan Exercises \"prepared the combined forces for potential contingencies and disasters and increased each country's ability to work together to protect Philippine sovereignty and preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\"\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) announced in April 2023 that it \"intends to expand funding on top of the $82 million\" that has already been allocated toward infrastructure investments in the original EDCA sites. In October 2023, Manila and Washington approved sixty-three additional projects to be constructed in the EDCA locations. In 2024, the Philippines announced that it plans to procure the Typhon missile system from the U.S.\nIn its four years in power, the Biden administration managed to take advantage of the opportunities to modernize its oldest bilateral alliance in East Asia. Indeed, the Biden administration also sought to strengthen the alliance management with the convening of first 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue (among defense and foreign ministers) in seven years, and the inaugural 3+3 Meeting (among defense and foreign ministers, and national security advisers).\nA Network of Alliances\nWhile revitalizing the bilateral Philippines-U.S. security relations, the Biden administration also made steps to build a network of alliances in the region. Indeed, in April 2024, Washington hosted the first Japan-Philippines-U.S. trilateral summit. In his remarks, President Biden underscored that \"a great deal of history in our world will be written in the Indo-Pacific over the coming years... we commit to writing that story and a future together, to building an Indo-Pacific that is free, open, prosperous, and secure for all.\"\nIn the Joint Vision of Statement issued by Presidents Biden and Marcos, and then-Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, the leaders expressed their \"serious concerns about the People's Republic of China's (PRC) dangerous and aggressive behavior in the South China Sea.\" The three leaders also expressed their \"strong opposition to any attempts by the PRC to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion in the East China Sea,\" as well as underscored the \"importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity.\"\nThe trilateral summit launched Luzon Economic Corridor initiative as part of the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI). As the first PGI initiative in the Indo-Pacific region, the Luzon Economic Corridor aims to support connectivity among Subic Bay, Clark, Manila, and Batangas in the Philippines. The three countries expressed their commitment \"to accelerating coordinated investments in high-impact infrastructure projects, including rail; ports modernization; clean energy and semiconductor supply chains and deployments; agribusiness; and civilian port upgrades at Subic Bay.\"\nApart from the historic trilateral summit, the Biden administration also sought forge and strengthen cooperation among its allies and partners through other platforms. Indeed, a meeting among the defense ministers of Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and the U.S. was convened for the first created_at in June 2023. The following year, another meeting of the \"Squad\" was convened. In 2024, a Maricreated_at Cooperative Activity (MCA) among the four countries was conducted in the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In doing so, the Squad underscored that they are \"safeguarding the international order based on the rule of law that is the foundation for a peaceful and stable Indo-Pacific region. Our four nations reaffirm the position regarding the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Tribunal Award as a final and legally binding decision on the parties to the dispute.\"\nQuo Vadis? \nIndeed, President Biden will leave a legacy of an enhanced Philippines-U.S. alliance. As such, administration of Mr. Donald J. Trump has a strong foundation to build upon as it implements its foreign policy agenda in the Philippines and beyond. There are three areas where the Trump administration can focus on with respect to the Philippines-U.S. alliance. First, the continuous implementation of EDCA, BDG, GSOMIA, and other agreements. Second, further institutionalizing the mechanisms for alliance management. Third, strengthening the efforts to build a network of alliances and partnerships in the region.\nHowever, it remains to be seen how the second Trump administration will deal with the Indo-Pacific. Nonetheless, if the first Trump term is any indication, there is reason to believe that President Biden's successor would likely sustain the upward trajectory of the Philippines-U.S. alliance. After all, it was the first Trump administration that underscored that \"strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security,\" while describing China as a \"revisionist power.\" Moreover, it was the Trump government that clarified treaty commitments to the Philippines in both public statements and domestic legislation, and clarified US South China Sea (SCS) policy. created_at will tell if second Trump administration will indeed build upon its predecessor's foreign policy legacy.\n"

In the meancreated_at, putting to one side its annexation of Tibet in 1951, China has been attempting to redraw rights of sea passage in the South China Sea by constructing an array of extensive military facilities and has systematically eroded Hong Kong's freedoms. Alarmingly, it has also on multiple occasions categorically asserted its aim to unify democratic Taiwan with mainland China, threatening to do so by force if necessary. But it is not just Russia and China, though they are the most important disrupters. \nThere are numerous countries and regimes that are not full participants in the rules-based order or which, like Iran and North Korea, pretty much play by their own rules. The result is a world where an increasing number of nations and societies put a low value on human life - President Putin does not value the lives of conscripts and convicts at all - where there is the highest ever number of conflicts in process, and where the UN is highly challenged due to players who do not accept the current rules. In particular, Russia and China have a veto on the Security Council. A significant number of countries feel that the system is not working for them and in the meancreated_at, need, greed and corruption see democracy being eroded on an alarming scale. In the 2000s and 2010s, the democracies became complacent. On the one hand, Russia retreated from international aggression and entered a short and confused era. On our side, we became risk averse as we clung to that old system, and we became averse to conflict and reluctant in the use of force. We made steep reductions in defence spending and were comfortable in what seemed to be a period of peace. But the integrated review of 2021 and its refresh already pronounced the decay of the rules-based international system, so for the democracies this new era of intensifying geopolitical competition requires new thinking. The extent of the challenge posed by large authoritarian states is clear. My good friends at the Council on Geostrategy - I declare an interest as a member of its advisory board - have summarised the mounting challenges we face succinctly under three headings, each highly destructive. First, we face an anti-systemic drive, primarily from Russia. Russia lacks the means to replace the prevailing order with a new one, even in the Euro-Atlantic area. Instead, it focuses on an anti-systemic approach designed to spoil and degrade the free and open international order, with a specific focus on eastern Europe, where, due to proximity and history, it is strongest. Secondly, we face a counter-systemic challenge, primarily from China. Beijing seeks to break down the free and open international order before replacing it with a new one centred on an authoritarian China. Thirdly, on a different point, many leading democracies seem unprepared to generate the power needed to underpin the system. For example, defence spending remains very low by historical standards, even when taking into account recent rises in Nato countries - particularly Poland and Germany - and elsewhere, such as Japan. We need to move faster to invest in our infrastructure, domestic industrial base and state autonomy to move away from economic links with authoritarian rivals. This is particularly acute when it comes to China, on which we have become dependent for many critical minerals and manufactures. It is created_at for a rethink and a more vigorous stance in defence of our freedoms, prosperity and that which we hold dear. We need to think more about shaping the international order of the future - a free and open international order. This means that we need to learn to value power and be willing to utilise it once again. Our competitors appear to understand power very well and they are prepared to take risks: from building fake islands in the South China Sea to invading foreign countries such as Ukraine. Perhaps, sadly, they have come to understand power and escalation better than we do. Undoubtedly, they recognise the extent to which the democracies would really far rather not engage in hostilities. But unfortunately, in this new world, power is going to be increasingly important to international relations. It always was critical. In the 1990s, however, our power became invisible and less important, at least to us. Power is not only about military strength, though we undoubtedly need more resources to uphold a strong defence which can deter. Power is also about economic strength and command over discourse and narratives. Much of this new era of competition already is - and will be - about economic, political and discursive instruments of power. In my remaining created_at, I will look at some things that I believe could be done. We need a whole-of-society approach with full societal engagement, not just for Britain but in other democracies. We also as a matter of urgency need to adopt longer-term thinking. Business typically has a short-term horizon while government of course has to live within electoral cycles.\n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-16",
    "text": "\n A new discovery in the South China Sea has astonished scientists. It is a giant crustacean that was nicknamed \"Darth Vader\" because of its striking resemblance to the iconic Star Wars villain. Researchers were astonished to observe the new species of giant isopod, which they named Bathynomus vaderi.\n \"It is a perfect example of how life can take surprising forms in the deep ocean,\" commented Dr. Liang Zhou, leader of the research team. He added that this finding highlights the importance of exploring the oceans, since a large part of the species that inhabit these remote regions of the planet are still unknown.   \n What does the giant sea creature look like?   \n The 'Darth Vader' crustacean is characterized by its large size and distinctive shape, which evokes the image of the famous Star Wars character. The researchers described its dark shell and unique physical characteristics, which set it apart from other known species. This finding is a reminder that there is still much to be discovered in the world's oceans.\n They revealed that this crustacean lives at a depth of more than 3,000 meters, an environment where pressure is extreme, sunlight does not reach and food resources are limited. These extreme conditions could have influenced the evolution of its shape and size, adapting it to survive in one of the most hostile environments on the planet.    \n Why is marine conservation important?   \n The appearance of Darth Vader highlights the importance of marine conservation. The oceans are essential to life on Earth, as they regulate the climate, provide oxygen and are home to countless species. However, human activity has endangered these ecosystems.\n The scientific community is calling for action to protect marine biodiversity and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.   \n What does this finding mean for the protection of ecosystems?   \n The discovery of 'Darth Vader' is not only a milestone in marine biology, but also a reminder of the responsibility we have as humans to care for our planet. The conservation of marine biodiversity is crucial to maintaining the balance of ecosystems and ensuring the health of our oceans.\n It is essential that effective policies are implemented to protect these areas and encourage scientific research to continue discovering and preserving the richness of marine life. \n"

    "created_at": "2025-01-16",
    "text": "\nChina News Service: The Commerce Department of the US issued new measures on AI export control. What's China's comment?\nGuo Jiakun: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce has responded to that. Let me stress that the US has been overstretching the concept of national security, politicizing and weaponizing trade and tech issues, and abusing export controls to maliciously suppress China. This has seriously sabotaged market rules and the international economic and trade order, destabilized global industrial and supply chain, and damaged the interests of China, the US and the business community in countries around the world. China firmly opposes the US decision and will take firm measures to safeguard the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies.\nAI is humanity's common asset, and should not become a game for the rich countries and the wealthy or be used to generate another development divide. To maintain its supremacy, the US chooses to split the world into tiers, granting access to countries that are close and barring access to the rest. The real purpose is to deprive developing countries, including China, of the right to make their own progress in science and development. This kind of roadblock strategy hurts the global common interest of promoting AI for good, and has triggered concerns from various quarters about a new tech Cold War from the US. Many US tech companies and industry associations have spoken loud and clear against the measures announced by the Biden administration.\nChina is an active advocate and practitioner of AI global governance. We put forward the Global Initiative for AI Governance, facilitated UNGA adoption by consensus of the resolution on AI capacity-building, and established the group of friends for international cooperation on AI capacity-building. China will continue to work with all parties to embrace openness, connectivity and equality instead of building walls, decoupling and discrimination, create an open, inclusive, and non-discriminatory environment for AI development that is beneficial to all, and make sure that all countries can access the benefit of AI.\nAFP: A spokesman for the Philippines' National Security Council said today that China's deployment this month of a coast guard vessel in the South China Sea demonstrates Beijing's increasing aggression. The spokesman described the Chinese vessel as a monster ship that was engaging in intimidation tactics intended to discourage Filipino fishing. Does the Foreign Ministry have a response to this?\nGuo Jiakun: We have responded to similar questions multiple created_ats. Let me reiterate that China's sovereignty and rights and interests in the South China Sea were established in the long course of history, and are solidly grounded in history and the law and compliant with the international law and practice. China Coast Guard (CCG) conducts patrols and law enforcement activities in relevant waters in accordance with the law, which is fully justified. We call on the Philippines once again to immediately stop all infringement activities, provocations and false accusations, and stop all its actions that jeopardize peace and stability and complicate the situation in the South China Sea.\nGlobal created_ats: The Global created_ats recently published a global public survey conducted among over 51,000 respondents in 46 countries. The survey found that more than 90 percent of foreign respondents believe that China's economy will continue to grow in the next decade, nearly 60 percent believe that China is a major driving force of world economic growth, 63 percent of foreign respondents express a favorable opinion of China, and in terms of different country groups, African countries hold the highest favorable view of China, reaching 84 percent. Nearly 70 percent of overseas respondents look to China to participate in international affairs more and play a greater role. What's your comment on the survey?\nGuo Jiakun: I noted this survey. The figures speak to growing friendships with China around the world.\nAs the world's second largest economy, China is committed to high-quality development and high-standard opening up and has long been a top contributor to global economic growth. As the biggest developing country, China belongs to the Global South and its heart and roots are with the Global South. China supports Global South countries in pursuing development and making life better for their people. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China advocates true multilateralism, keeps its position fair and just and plays a constructive role in seeking a political settlement on hotspot issues. This has earned China wide recognition from the international community.\nNo matter how the world may evolve, China will remain a force for peace, growth, progress and good, and will continue working with other countries for a world of greater peace, shared prosperity, mutual learning among civilizations and a community with a shared future for mankind.\nBloomberg: Germany is going to give its armed forces the ability to shoot down unidentified suspected drones that are suspected of targeting for example military bases, industrial facilities and other critical infrastructure. The German cabinet is expected to pass this on Wednesday. This is according to people familiar. My question is why it does not name any specific countries? It's said that the main suspected culprits are Russia and China. Does the Foreign Ministry have any comment on this move by Germany to give its armed forces the ability to shoot down unidentified suspected drones?\nGuo Jiakun: I'm not familiar with what you mentioned. Let me reiterate that we firmly oppose groundless speculations and false accusations against China from relevant parties.\nThe Paper: Yesterday, the General Office of China's State Council released a list of measures to foster new growth drivers to boost spending in the culture and tourism sectors. One of the measures is to improve inbound travel policies, including gradually rolling out unilateral visa-free policies to more countries. Recently, China's visa exemption policies have given a boost to inbound travel. In particular, since the start of the year, China Travel has kept trending, and a good number of foreign tourists spent their New Year's Eve in China. It's estimated by some travel agencies that the number of travel bookings for the Spring Festival this year will increase by 203 percent year-on-year compared with 2024. What's your comment?\nGuo Jiakun: As China includes more countries in its visa waiver program and improves facilitation measures, the arrivals of foreign tourists have kept rising. In 2024, the number of inbound and outbound travels by foreign nationals stood at 64.882 million, up by 82.9 percent year-on-year. Among them, 20.115 million entered China visa-free, up by 112.3 percent year-on-year. During the just concluded New Year holiday, arrivals of foreign nationals grew by 34 percent year-on-year.\nWith the Chinese New Year of the Snake half a month away, which is the first Spring Festival since the inscription of the festival on the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list, we welcome foreign tourists to join China's celebration of the Spring Festival, experience the joy of the Chinese New Year, feel the warmth of Chinese hospitality, and usher in an auspicious Year of the Snake.\nDragon TV: It's reported that on January 12, during normal operation, the Wolseong No.2 nuclear power plant in the North Gyeongsang province of the ROK released about 29 tonnes of liquid waste of a storage tank into the sea without prior sample analysis. Staff at the power plant shut the tank's outlet valve right after finding it being open. According to the analysis of samples from the liquid left in the tank, the concentration of radioactive substances were at normal levels. What's China's comment on the leakage of the ROK nuclear power plant?\nGuo Jiakun: China noted the incident. From what has been disclosed, the ROK has taken emergency response steps. China will follow closely the follow-ups to the incident.\nAFP: Outgoing US President Joe Biden said yesterday in a speech that China would never surpass the United States. He also noted that Washington had managed its ties with Beijing during his four years as President and the relationship never tipped over into conflict. Does the Foreign Ministry have any comment on Biden's speech?\nGuo Jiakun: During the past four years, China-US relations have gone through ups and downs, but have remained stable on the whole. Under the strategic guidance of the two presidents, the two sides established through consultation several guiding principles for bilateral ties, engaged in dialogue and cooperation, resumed and created over 20 mechanisms of communication, and achieved outcomes in some areas. At the same created_at, China stood firm by its principles, safeguarded its sovereignty, security, and development interests, and responded to the US's wrong actions with resolute countermeasures.\nIn his meeting with President Biden in Lima, Peru, President Xi Jinping reviewed the experiences from the past four years and listed the inspirations that can be drawn from them, namely, to have a correct strategic perception, match words with actions, treat each other as equals, not to challenge red lines and paramount principles, conduct more dialogue and cooperation, respond to the expectations of the people, and step forward to shoulder the responsibilities of major countries. We hope the US will bear them in mind and work with China in this direction.\nNBC: Is China or relevant departments concerned considering any concrete foreign assistance and sympathies for the fight against the still-burning wildfires in Los Angeles now considered as the most catastrophic in the US history?\nGuo Jiakun: We mourn for the lives lost in the raging wildfires in the Los Angeles area, and express sympathies to those who are injured, their families and those who have lost loved ones to the fire.\nSource: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China\n"

    "text": "\n Philippine maricreated_at authorities on Wednesday reiterated that they would not abide by China's attempts to 'normalize' its acts of intimidation in the West Philippine Sea by deploying 'The Monster,' its biggest coast guard vessel, to the area.\n'You have to look at the presence of the monster ship as a reaction to our legislated archipelagic sea-lane and maricreated_at zones act,' Rear Adm. Roy Vincent Trinidad, the Philippine Navy spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, told the Inquirer.\nTrinidad was referring to the Philippine Maricreated_at Zones Act and Philippine Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act, which President Marcos signed into law in November.\n'We legislated. They countered. And now they are enforcing. That's how simple it is,' Trinidad said.\nOn Tuesday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the monster ship called China Coast Guard (CCG) 5901 was simply enforcing the law since the waters belong to Beijing's 'sovereign' territory.\nBut Commodore Jay Tarriela, the Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, said that intimidation has 'consistently been part of the Chinese playbook' and has been applied to other nations as well.\nMaricreated_at security expert Ray Powell earlier reported that Beijing also used CCG 5901 in 2024 to intimidate Vietnam by intruding into Hanoi's oil and gas fields in the South China Sea.\nThe year before that, CCG 5901 was sent to intimidate Indonesia by intruding into Jakarta's exclusive economic zone in the North Natuna Sea.\n'Their goal is to normalize such deployments, and if these actions go unnoticed and unchallenged, it will enable them to alter the existing status quo,' Tarriela said.\nUsual playbook\n'This strategy of normalization, followed by altering the status quo and ultimately operationalizing their illegal narrative, has consistently been part of the Chinese playbook,' he added.\nTarriela said the BRP Teresa Magbanua was one of the two cutters Manila sent to continuously challenge the presence of CCG 5901 off the coast of Zambales.\nBut maricreated_at authorities stressed that they still consider such intrusions as threats to the country's sovereignty, even if it is just a submersible drone, like the one fishermen found in Masbate in December.\n'Regardless of whether it is a commercial or military specification, we will always treat it as a threat to our sovereignty,' Defense Undersecretary Ignacio Madriaga told senators on Wednesday.\nSecurity officials believe the drone was Chinese, but no nation has claimed the equipment.\nForeign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega said the Department of Foreign Affairs has not made any inquiry with other countries as to the ownership of the drone.\n'We did not send out a note to ask, 'Is this yours?' But we have not received any information, as expected, from any foreign state to claim ownership of the drone,' he said.\nAsked if the government would allow China to conduct marine scientific research in its territorial waters should it ask, De Vega responded: 'Very doubtful given that we have issues with them. If China requests, I would not say no. But it's extremely doubtful,' he said. -with a report from Jacob Lazaro\n"

    "text": "\nRather than sealing off its \"wolf warrior diplomacy,\" which is meant to intimidate adversaries through belligerent behavior, China appears to be using different approaches in different situations for its own convenience.\nThe administration of Chinese President Xi Jinping is hurrying to improve relations with neighboring countries. In particular, there has been a noticeable softening in its dealings with nations that are allies of the United States or friendly with that country, such as Australia, India and Japan.\nChina is likely making strategic moves to avoid a situation in which the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, which is clearly taking a hard-line stance toward China, and these countries unite to put pressure on Beijing.\nIn December last year, the Australian government announced that China had agreed to lift its import bans on some Australian beef. Prior to this, an agreement was also reached to rescind a ban on imports of Australian lobster to China.\nRelations between the two countries became strained when the Australian government called on China for an independent probe into the source of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. China imposed broad restrictions on imports of Australian goods, but now restrictions will be totally lifted.\nIn October 2024, China held its first official leaders' summit in five years with India, with whom Beijing has been at loggerheads over a border issue. Dialogue on the matter between special representatives of the two countries had been suspended since 2019 but has now been resumed.\nTrump has indicated his intention to impose a blanket 60% tariff on imports from China. Beijing is believed to be trying to increase the number of countries with which it can cooperate in economic and trade areas, in anticipation of a further cooling of its domestic economy.\nIn autumn last year, China reinstated visa waivers for short-term visits to China by Japanese nationals that had been suspended due to the pandemic. This may indicate that Beijing expects increased economic exchanges and investment. Members of Japan's ruling bloc - including Hiroshi Moriyama, the secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party - visited China to participate in the Japan-China Ruling Party Exchange Council that resumed on Jan. 14 for the first created_at in six years.\nThe Xi administration has been advocating \"multilateral cooperation\" and \"mutual benefits.\" If China is serious about emphasizing dialogue, this could be an opportunity for Japan and other countries to resolve bilateral issues.\nHowever, despite its recent \"smile diplomacy,\" China has not abandoned its high-handed approach of trying to bring its opponents to their knees by force, citing such reasons as ensuring its national security.\nChina Coast Guard vessels have frequently intruded into Japanese territorial waters in the areas surrounding the Senkaku Islands in Okinawa Prefecture. In the South China Sea, there has been a spate of cases in which CCG vessels have hit Philippine ships and fired water cannons at them. China has also repeatedly conducted large-scale military exercises around Taiwan.\nFor China to gain the trust of other nations and achieve a desirable international environment, it must begin by correcting the contradictions in its own words and deeds.\n(From The Yomiuri Shimbun, Jan. 15, 2025)\n"

    "text": "\nClick to view video (available for 30 days from publication date): \nSpeech to text transcript:1\nwill chair a debate. Can the Minister update us on who is attending from the UK? I would welcome an update in this respect. We led with the previous Trump Administration on establishing the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance. \nI hope that will go from strength to strength during the second Trump presidency. On women's rights, we led on important issues such as WPS and women mediators' networks. I would welcome an update on Women Mediators across the Commonwealth, which the last Government established. There is also the question of addressing terrorism and extremism. We need international collaboration to combat terrorism and ensure the security of nations. The UK's commitment to upholding the international rules-based system, even amid rising challenges, by prioritising what we are best at - diplomacy, standing up for justice and inclusive development - must remain at the heart of our foreign policy approach. It is for us and the Government to keep this flame alive. My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, for her comprehensive introduction to this important debate. I think many of us will be emphasising the many points that she made. That there is a threat to the system of political, legal and economic rules which have governed international relations since the end of World War II is in no doubt. A new feudal order is emerging. The question becomes should this, if not be accepted, at least remain unchallenged or should there be new international norms and treaties taking into account current realities such as environmental conditions, international commitments, and principles of national sovereignty and self-determination? If the latter, what might these new norms look like and who would draft them? Perhaps it is preferable to go for a middle way and focus on reforms to the existing order. The task is to salvage an international order that is now gravely weakened. The last almost 80 years underpinned the principles of sovereignty, democracy and human rights. More recently, international rules have resulted in trade liberalisation through economic governance, the advent of a number of new peacekeeping missions, the International Criminal Court, as we have heard, and the insistence on women's and LGBT rights. But there remains suspicion and departure from these accepted norms because they are perceived as imposing a system invented by liberal democracies for the benefit of western diplomatic, military and economic agendas. These growing views of western manipulation have given rise to a gradual but quickening departure from these rules. Egregious examples abound. They include the distaste for multilateralism, with Trump - I nearly said \"chump\" - insisting on the unimpeded exercise of American power in pursuit of defined national interests, China's preference for bilateral diplomatic transactions, together with a new-found assertiveness in the UN, as well as its unbending approach where its interests are threatened, an example of which is its refusal to abide by the court of arbitration decision concerning disputes with the Philippines over the South China Sea, and, of course, Russia's subversion of international rules. We have the continuing fragmentation of the system brought about by new centres of world power, increasing populist and nationalist pressures, new and empowered centres of political dissent, international crime and terror networks, and the rise of non-state actors, among other 21st-century developments. This democratic backsliding and the accompanying rise in authoritarianism threatens international peace and stability by undermining the democratic political process - for example, by using technology supply chains as a means of repression. Last September, the United Nations adopted a resolution, a \"pact for the future\", which called for a recommitment to international co-operation based on respect for international law and the strengthening of multilateral institutions.\n"

    "text": "\nClick to view video (available for 30 days from publication date): \nSpeech to text transcript:1\nAs my noble friend Lord Gascoigne reminded us, Trump won a fair, democratic election, and, of course, we know that he can serve only a four-year term. By all means, criticise some of his statements - I suspect that we will spend a lot of created_at in the next few months and years ruminating on the various utterances of President Trump - but I think the noble Baroness made a flawed analogy in comparing the US, which, in my view, is still the world's greatest democracy, with Russia and China, so I hope she will reflect on that. The rules-based international order has enabled nations large and small to co-operate under shared principles, ensuring that the rule of law prevails over the rule of might. Today, however, as many have pointed out in this debate, this order is under threat as never before, and it is incumbent upon us, as defenders of freedom, sovereignty and stability, to address many of those challenges head on. \nAs many have pointed out, the first and most visible challenges come from the authoritarian states that I just mentioned, particularly Russia and China, whose actions flagrantly undermine international norms. Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and brutal war in Ukraine represent a blatant rejection of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, a core tenet of the UN Charter. I listened with interest to the comment from the noble Lord, Lord Liddell: possibly like Tony Blair at the created_at, I was optimistic about the direction Russia could go in following the collapse of the Soviet Union. I think all of us wanted to see Russia admitted into the family of western democratic states, and there was a possibility that that would happen, but we all now see the direction that Russia has taken, and we have to recognise it for what it is now: a threat to the international order and to European security. Similarly, across the South China Sea, we see China's militarisation, economic coercion of smaller states, and flagrant disregard for any international rulings on territories or the famous lines that they impose on the maps, seemingly making up and deciding what is Chinese sovereign territory. This really offers a systemic challenge to the global order. These actions are not just mere aberrations. They are, in my view, deliberate attempts to reshape the international order into one that privileges power over principles. Such behaviour destabilises regions, weakens alliances and creates a permissive environment for other rogue actors to flout international law - we can see how Russia is now cosying up to those paragons of democracy in North Korea and Iran to further its aims. The second challenge lies in the erosion of trust within the system itself. Many multilateral institutions that were indeed put in place initially to safeguard global stability are increasingly seen as ineffective or politicised. The failure of some organisations to act decisively against aggression or hold nations accountable risks undermining their very legitimacy. We believe in strong, accountable institutions, but this requires reform to ensure that they are fit for purpose and responsive to the challenges of the 21st century. Furthermore, the rise of economic protectionism and deglobalisation poses a subtler but equally significant threat. Free trade and open markets have lifted millions out of poverty and fostered interdependence, which discourages conflict. Yet, we will have to return to the battles many of us thought were won in the 1980s and 1990s in favour of multilateralism, free trade and globalisation, and refight those ideological battles, because retreat into economic nationalism risks dividing the world into competing blocs, undermining both prosperity and stability. Those challenges are compounded by the growing influence of the non-state actors that a number of noble Lords referred to - from cybercriminals to extremist groups - that exploit the gaps in governance and the vulnerabilities of our interconnected world. Their actions transcend borders, creating a fragmented and volatile global landscape. We must, first, reaffirm our commitment to the principles that underpin the rules-based order: sovereignty, democracy and the rule of law. This requires a robust defence of our values on the global stage,\n"

    "text": "\n Predictions about 2025 come with flashing caveats: no one can know what US President-elect Donald Trump will do, let alone how the rest of the world will respond. But one can speculate. Imagine it is January 2026.\nAs 2025 began, the mood of the American business community shifted. Some businesspeople had long harboured private doubts about Mr Trump's anti-globalisation campaign. But overall confidence began to fall when they came face to face with the possible consequences of cutting the US economy off from international trade and migration: sharply higher prices of imported products and labour shortages in some sectors.\nPublic anxieties multiplied as mysterious cyber-attacks caused a series of failures affecting US power infrastructure and water and sanitation systems. Some childhood diseases like measles returned. From Inauguration Day, social media hesitated to highlight efforts by public-health and information-technology professionals to correct the accompanying misinformation.\nMost dramatic in the first half of 2025 was the correction in the US stock market, with the S and P 500 index down by around 35%. To be sure, the market had been ripe for a correction. The S and P 500 had increased sevenfold between January 2009 and the 2024 election, fuelled by stronger-than-expected growth in US output and employment in 2021-24. By the end of President Joe Biden's term, stocks had entered bubble territory. Whether evaluated relative to earnings, dividends, capital stock replacement value, or GDP, share prices had reached levels reminiscent of 1929 and other pre-crash episodes.\nBut it took a needle to prick the bubble. Having gained majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Republicans also gained responsibility for producing a federal budget. But they were split: while they agreed that the US was on an unsustainable fiscal path, they disagreed on the solution. One faction touted lower taxes as the key to fiscal virtue (dismissing the \"experts' view\" that this would worsen the budget balance rather than improve it), and the other, spurred by Elon Musk, emphasised spending cuts. (The much-hyped Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) -- headed by Mr Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy -- had little impact in 2025.)\nBudget negotiations devolved into an all-too-familiar game of chicken. When neither side flinched, the US faced a fiery collision, in the form of a month-long government shutdown and credit downgrades by all three major ratings agencies, which in turn crashed stock and bond markets.\nAs the year drew to a close, some observers argued that the US is in recession. In any case, rising inflation -- fuelled by Trump's tariffs and his attacks on the US Federal Reserve's independence -- augurs the return of 1970s-style stagflation.\nAt the same created_at, there was a vast divergence between what Mr Trump's supporters and opponents expected and what they got in 2025. As it turned out, the business community unexpectedly prevailed on him for higher caps on the number of H-1B visas (for high-skilled workers) and expansion of other legal immigration channels. Mr Trump also re-reversed himself on TikTok. He made big changes to his cabinet, firing Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy, Jr, who sought tougher regulations for pharmaceutical companies. Beyond the economy, Mr Trump took other unexpected steps. His most startling volte-face was his support of states guaranteeing a woman's right to abortion. He insisted he has always believed the matter should be decided at the state level.\nIn terms of foreign policy, one big shock was the first armed US incursion into Mexico in over a century. Before that, Mr Trump withdrew support from Ukraine, as expected, effectively surrendering to Russia and fatally undermining US credibility in the eyes of potential adversaries, not least Russian President Vladimir Putin himself. Russian troops moved into parts of Georgia and ominously popped up along its 2,400km border with Nato, tying down their Western counterparts throughout the year.\nWith the US distracted, and a new precedent set regarding respect -- or the lack thereof -- for national borders, Venezuela invaded Guyana, Ethiopia invaded Somalia, and Indonesia invaded Timor Leste. Unencumbered by the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, from which Mr Trump withdrew in 2018, and weakened by the decimation of its proxies in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, the Iranian regime completed its development of nuclear weapons.\nMost alarming, however, were naval actions by China, whether a reaction to its economic downturn, which Mr Trump's tariffs have exacerbated, or an effort to exploit America's current weakness. Throughout the year, Chinese forces were active in the waters around Taiwan and on newly fortified islands that it claims in the South China Sea. With Mr Trump's tough-guy reputation roundly questioned, he surprised everyone when he responded to a ship collision, in which several US sailors were killed, by sending a joint US-Philippine naval force to retake Scarborough Shoal and the Spratly Islands. In a pattern familiar from modern history, the Trump administration carried out a threat of military intervention that it had neglected to signal in advance.\nAt year end, China's coast guard appeared to be installing a \"quarantine\" of Taiwan. Mr Trump has now sent all naval forces the US can spare to break the blockade if necessary. As 2026 gets underway, fears of a hot war between the two nuclear superpowers seem all too real. Throughout 2025, Mr Trump's opponents consoled themselves with thoughts of a silver lining: their fellow Americans would finally see the consequences of having such a president. Before long, his influence would plummet, both in Congress and among the electorate, as he spent more created_at playing golf at Mar-a-Lago. No such luck. As usual, Mr Trump blames the disruptions and disasters of 2025 on anyone or anything other than himself. Likewise, his supporters do not see the adverse developments of 2025 as his fault. Why should they, when they never have before? True, Mr Trump's supporters are unable to distill the appropriate lessons from history. But in predicting that they will, his opponents are ignoring history as well. \n"

    "title": "Preparing Australia for Trump s return: do more, spend more, risk more",
    "created_at": "2025-01-16",
    "text": "\nAustralia: Australian Strategic Policy Institute has issued the following press release:\nAustralia can ’ t expect Donald Trump to judge its strategic value by historical ties. The focus will be on our willingness to protect ourselves and capacity to contribute to shared strategic interests.\nThe world is more dangerous today than during the first Trump administration, with competing priorities across Europe, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific. Australia needs to do more, spend more and risk more in response to these threats. This would be the case even without Trump in the White House.\nAustralia ’ s trade deficit with the United States helped during Trump ’ s first term, because of the administration ’ s focus on fair trade. But it was not the only reason for Australia ’ s success in working with Trump then. We thrived because, coming out of the 2016 Defence White Paper, our defence spending was rising and because we led efforts to counter China ’ s malign influence.\nThe new Trump administration will continue to frame China as the pacing threat. Australia and Britain, the US ’ s partners in AUKUS, seem in some policies to be putting trade with China ahead of long-term security concerns. That won ’ t be welcomed by Trump ’ s team, especially if accompanied by any expectation that the US takes on the economic and security risks emanating from China.\nTrump has suggested that NATO allies lift defence spending to 5 percent of GDP—more than double the alliance ’ s existing spending target of 2 percent. This is, in part, intended as a wakeup call to the nine NATO members that do not meet the current target.\nThese NATO members and other allies such as Australia should lift their defence capabilities not because of fear of Trump but because they face security threats. In an Australian federal election year, economic ministries will argue any lift in defence spending requires careful balancing against the full range of pressures on the budget. This is true.\nAustralia needs to show Trump a persuasive value proposition around what it ’ s doing for its own security and, as a result, for regional security and the Australia-US alliance.So, lifting spending on defence and technologies to enhance military and cyber capabilities is the first priority to consider as we look towards a new Trump administration.With almost daily reports about Beijing ’ s increasing control of the information domain, including through the hacking of US and Australian critical infrastructure, Australia should make addressing Beijing ’ s malign actions a top-tier joint effort with the Trump administration, using and going beyond AUKUS Pillar 2 on advanced technologies.\nThe cyber effort should be complemented by greater investment in space security that allows us to burden-share in orbit. The 2024 National Defence Strategy alludes to the importance of space control to counter threats by hostile actors but this domain has seen spending cuts at precisely the wrong created_at. Similarly, advanced autonomous systems that are low-cost but able to be acquired in high volumes would enhance the Australian Defence Force ’ s capability and assist US efforts to counter Chinese threats.\nThe second priority to consider is securing critical supply chains by reducing reliance on China. Focusing on selective technology decoupling from China, the Trump administration is likely to expect Australia to play a leading role in securing resilient supply chains, particularly for critical minerals. Building on its spending on the Future Made in Australia policy, Canberra should consider further developing local processing capabilities, establishing joint ventures with foreign companies, including US companies, and securing diversified long-term supply contracts to reduce reliance on China.\nThis week we have seen the US make security decisions in these areas, including banning Chinese smart cars. Chinese components in wind and solar panel technology may also be a prioritised concern for the US. The Australian government should make it clear that it supports such decisions and views them in similar terms to 5G policies. It should also signal its intent to similarly prioritise Australia ’ s national security in these areas, promoting establishment of reliable supply chains and working with the US to gain broader support for them.\nThird, we must increase operational support for the US in the Indo-Pacific to counter China ’ s influence. For our own regional security, Australia should re-align with US efforts to push back—openly, not just privately—on Beijing ’ s economic coercion, military aggression and abuse of technology. This may require Australia to increase its maricreated_at presence in contested areas such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, potentially in cooperation with India, South Korea or Japan.\nAnother option would be to widen access arrangements for US military forces to operate from Australian defence facilities, particularly in northern Australia, and accelerate plans for investment in defending those bases against growing missile threats from China. The 2023 Defence Strategic Review recommended an urgent move to deploy missile defence capabilities, including interceptor missiles, but the government failed to act on this recommendation in the 2024 Integrated Investment Program, deferring a decision until the 2026 program.\nFourth, we must use regional mechanisms, such as the Quad and AUKUS, to maintain stability. Australia should lead a recommitment to the Quad ’ s security interests, downplayed in recent years for fear of upsetting Beijing, and expand the alliance ’ s public focus on defence and cyber threats. Australia should also strengthen both pillars of AUKUS, contributing to the success of Pillar 1 through local infrastructure and expertise while ensuring Pillar 2 identifies the capabilities the three nations and their partners need.\nAustralia shouldn ’ t act just to please the US or Trump. Good national security policy is good for the Australia-US alliance and our international partnerships. Investing in defence and security means we will always be able to say ‘no ’ when a request is not in our interest. By articulating our value commensurate with the worsening geostrategic circumstances, Australia also makes clear we don ’ t rely on just the US, but on each other.\n"

    "text": "\nIn an unprecedented move, incoming U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will host foreign ministers from Japan, Australia, and India on the sidelines of President-elect Donald Trump's swearing-in ceremony. This meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) nations marks an important moment in global diplomacy, signaling that the Quad will remain central to U.S. foreign policy during Trump's second term. The Quad - consisting of the United States, Japan, India, and Australia - is poised to become an even more significant force in the Indo-Pacific region as tensions with China continue to escalate.\nWhat is the Quad?\nThe Quad is a strategic partnership formed between four democracies: the United States, Japan, India, and Australia. Initially conceived as a response to regional security concerns, it has grown into a broader coalition focused on economic, environmental, and technological issues, as well as security. Although the grouping is often referred to as an \"Asian NATO\" by critics - particularly in China - it is not a formal military alliance but rather a diplomatic platform for cooperation.\nThe Quad first emerged in 2007 under the leadership of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, U.S. President George W. Bush, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and Australian Prime Minister John Howard. However, the grouping lost momentum shortly after its inception due to various geopolitical challenges. It was not until 2017 that the Trump administration reenergized the Quad, positioning it as a counterbalance to China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The dialogue was initially held at the vice-ministerial level, but in 2019 it moved to a foreign ministers' level, reflecting the increasing importance of the Quad in global geopolitics.\nThe Significance of the First Quad Foreign Ministers' Meeting\nThe fact that the first official meeting of Quad foreign ministers will take place during the inauguration of Donald Trump's second term highlights the renewed commitment of the U.S. to the grouping. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's leadership will be pivotal in setting the tone for future Quad initiatives. Foreign Ministers Takeshi Iwaya of Japan, Penny Wong of Australia, and Subrahmanyam Jaishankar of India will join Rubio at this historic gathering, marking a key moment for the Quad.\nThis meeting is expected to lay the groundwork for a Quad Leaders' Summit later in the year. The summit will offer the four countries a platform to discuss shared security concerns in the Indo-Pacific, including China's assertiveness in the region, freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, and economic resilience in the face of growing geopolitical uncertainties.\nThe Quad's Role in Countering China\nFor China, the Quad has been a long-standing source of concern, frequently viewed as a bloc aimed at containing its growing influence. Chinese officials have long criticized the Quad, labeling it an attempt to form an \"Asian NATO\" and accusing it of meddling in regional conflicts under the guise of ensuring freedom of navigation. In particular, upcoming joint coast guard exercises by the Quad countries have raised alarms in Beijing, who view them as part of a broader strategy to curb China's maricreated_at ambitions.\nHowever, it's important to note that the Quad is not solely a counter-China alliance. While Beijing's expansion in the Indo-Pacific is a significant driver of the grouping's activities, the Quad has increasingly addressed other global challenges, including climate change, technological innovation, and health security.\nWhat to Expect from Trump 2.0 and the Quad's Future\nUnder Trump's leadership, the Quad is expected to take a more security-focused approach, with an emphasis on burden-sharing among the four nations. The Quad, according to U.S. officials like Rubio, will continue to operate on the principle that all members contribute equitably to regional stability. This could translate into more active military and maricreated_at cooperation, though the grouping's broadening agenda suggests that economic and technological concerns will also remain at the forefront.\nThe second Trump administration is likely to intensify the Quad's focus on countering China. Figures like Rubio and Mike Waltz, both staunch proponents of strengthening U.S. alliances in the Indo-Pacific, are expected to push for more robust actions in the region. This could include increased military presence, expanded joint military exercises, and more comprehensive diplomatic efforts aimed at isolating China's influence.\nHowever, the Quad faces internal challenges, particularly given the varying priorities of its members. India, while a key partner in countering China, has been cautious in its engagement with the U.S. due to its complex relationship with Beijing. Australia, on the other hand, maintains strong economic ties with China, which complicates its position within the Quad. Japan, too, faces its own security dilemmas, including territorial disputes with China in the East China Sea. Despite these challenges, the Quad has proven resilient, with each nation acknowledging the need for closer collaboration to maintain peace and stability in the region.\nThe Quad's Growing Influence on Global Affairs\nThe Quad's evolution reflects the shifting dynamics of global power. Once viewed primarily as a security bloc, it has expanded its reach to address broader issues such as economic resilience, climate change, and global health. The upcoming Quad Leaders' Summit, which India is set to host in 2025, will be a defining moment for the grouping, as it looks to solidify its role as a central actor in shaping global norms and responses to emerging challenges.\nIndia's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar recently stated that the Quad has come a long way since its revival in 2017. He noted that the U.S. under Trump has played a pivotal role in reinvigorating the Quad, and that the grouping's growing influence is now evident in its expansive agenda. He also highlighted that despite varying levels of engagement, all Quad nations contribute equally to the partnership, ensuring a fair distribution of responsibilities.\nThe upcoming Quad Leaders' Summit in 2025 will likely focus on Indo-Pacific security but will also address broader global issues such as climate change, technological innovation, and economic cooperation. As the Quad's role expands, it will continue to play a central part in shaping the geopolitical landscape in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.\n"

    "text": "\nOn Jan 20, Donald Trump will take office at a created_at of global volatility unparalleled since the Cold War era. As the world speculates on how his second term might shape US foreign policy, one question looms large: how will US-China relations be in Trump's second term? Will Trump sustain the confrontational approach that defined his first term, or pivot toward recalibration? To understand what lies ahead, it is essential to consider three dominant perspectives on Trump's foreign policy, each with its own merit: his \"transactional leadership\" style, the \"Jacksonian\" tradition shaping his foreign policy doctrine, and the institutional dynamics that have fostered a bipartisan consensus on China — all within the context of China's evolving strengths in economic, technological, military and diplomatic realms.\nA common perspective holds that Trump's leadership style is \"transactional\" to its core. He thrives on short-term, measurable gains, often at the expense of long-term strategy or alliances. Trump's transactionalism, which defined his first term, prioritizes deal-making over coherent policymaking and ideological commitments, leveraging unpredictability as a negotiation tool.\nIn his dealings with China, Trump has alternated between combative rhetoric and unexpected praise. This seemingly erratic behavior appears to be a transactional strategy aimed at keeping opponents off balance and maximizing leverage. Trump's approach, which involves elements of \"high anchoring\" and \"brinkmanship \"strategies, is exemplified by his proposed 60 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, a tactic that involves setting extreme demands to push the boundaries of what is considered negotiable. Trump's unpredictability, such as his dramatic shift on TikTok from proposing a ban to opposing restrictions, reflects his tendency to use issues as bargaining chips. Similarly, his threats to \"retake\" the Panama Canal illustrate a willingness to escalate disputes for short-term advantage, often blurring the line between negotiation and provocation.\nFrom an ideational perspective, Trump's approach is often associated with the Jacksonian tradition of US foreign policy. By invoking Andrew Jackson — the seventh US president remembered as a racist slaver and genocidal tyrant with Napoleonic aspirations — as his political hero, Trump aligns himself with a lineage that views free trade, international cooperation, and multilateral agreements as constraints on US autonomy.\nInterestingly, Trump's focus on acquiring territories such as Panama and Greenland echoes Jackson's expansionist approach. Jackson sought territorial gains through purchase and, when thwarted, covertly supported settlers, fueling a proxy war in Texas. Jackson's administration also used naval force in Sumatra to assert US power and secure US interests, a strategy mirrored in Trump's nationalist ambitions.\nTrump's Jacksonian populism appears to have driven his decisions to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, the Paris Agreement and the World Health Organization. It also informed his criticism of NATO as \"obsolete\" and his rejection of NAFTA in favor of bilateral deals. Trump's populist rhetoric about China — labeling it a \"thief\" of US intellectual property — further underscores this Jacksonian ethos. Under the Trump doctrine, moreover, the National Security Strategy shifted from counterterrorism to long-term rivalry with so-called revisionist powers, particularly China. This framework justified the trade war, which resulted in tariffs on Chinese goods and restrictions on technology companies such as Huawei.\nTrump's disruptive style and alignment with a crude nationalist tradition aside, his policies toward China align with a broader institutional consensus that has emerged during the 2010s. Long before Trump's first presidency, US political elites began viewing China's peaceful rise as a strategic threat. The Barack Obama administration's pivot to Asia marked the beginning of this shift, which Trump expanded upon, and Joe Biden has reinforced.\nTrump's free and open \"Indo-Pacific\" strategy, unveiled in 2017, built on Obama's regional focus, reviving alliances such as the Quad and promoting \"Freedom of Navigation\" operations in the South China Sea. His administration passed the BUILD Act, creating the US International Development Finance Corporation to challenge China's Belt and Road Initiative. Trump's policy on the Taiwan region also became a cornerstone of his China strategy. His administration normalized arms sales to Taiwan island, and passed the Taiwan Travel Act, fostering high-level diplomatic exchanges. Biden has expanded many of these initiatives, expanding the US tariffs and sanctions on China, introducing the \"Indo-Pacific\" Economic Framework for Prosperity, initiating the \"Chip 4 Alliance\" and forging the AUKUS security pact with Australia and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the past three administrations reflect a bipartisan consensus that China is the US' principal geopolitical challenge, ensuring continuity in US-China rivalry regardless of Trump's leadership style.\nFinally, Trump's Cabinet picks and campaign donors suggest continuity in his hard-line stance on China, which strongly reflects this bipartisan consensus. Key donors, such as Timothy Mellon, who praised Trump's trade efforts, and Robert Bigelow, advocating for US dominance in space exploration, align with his nationalist agenda. Elon Musk presents a more nuanced case; while opposing US tariffs and maintaining business ties in China, rising tensions over China's efforts to reduce reliance on Tesla and Starlink could push Musk closer to Trump's policies.\nTrump's Cabinet selections further reflect an aggressive stance. Marco Rubio, J.D. Vance and Mike Waltz are among the staunchest critics of China, advocating for measures such as banning Chinese telecom equipments, bolstering Taiwan island's military capabilities, and enhancing US military readiness in the \"Indo-Pacific\" region. Elise Stefanik previously targeted Chinese influence in elections and academia, while Pete Hegseth and John Ratcliffe focused on countering China's development efforts.\nDespite this bipartisan consensus, the US faces a transformed geopolitical landscape compared to Trump's first term, as China has significantly bolstered its global position. Economically, China has achieved significant progress in strategic industries such as manufacturing, green technology and artificial intelligence, while the BRI continues to expand its influence in Africa, Southeast Asia and Europe. Militarily, advancements in hypersonic weapons, naval and aerial capabilities, and cyber technologies enhance China's ability to counter US expansionism. Diplomatically, China has diversified its multilateral engagement and alliances with nations such as Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia, challenging US containment efforts. Therefore, a hawkish approach alone may be insufficient without a nuanced understanding of China's evolving strengths.\nTrump's return to the presidency is likely to deepen the US strategic rivalry with China, but the dynamics of this confrontation have shifted significantly. China's remarkable progress in economic, technological, military and diplomatic spheres ensures that it is not merely a passive player but an active agent in global power realignments. While institutional and ideational dimensions of US policy point to continuity in countering China's peaceful development, Trump's unpredictable and transactional style introduces an element of volatility that Beijing is well-prepared to manage. Ultimately, the impact of Trump's second term will depend not only on how he balances these dimensions of his foreign policy but also on how China leverages its strengths. This chapter in US-China relations may redefine the contours of global power in an increasingly multipolar world.\nThe author is an adjunct professor at Shanghai University and visiting senior fellow at the London School of Economics.

    "text": "\n Ex-media boss admits to payment after prosecutors challenge his claim of no foreign policy influence in Hong Kong and the mainland   \nHong Kong prosecutors have begun cross-examining Jimmy Lai Chee-ying as part of his marathon national security trial, after the defence wrapped up its first round of questioning of the former media boss on Thursday. \nThe 77-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily tabloid newspaper has provided verbal testimony at West Kowloon Court for 26 days since first taking the witness box last November. \nThe three presiding High Court judges previously ruled he had a case to answer on two conspiracy charges of collusion with foreign forces and a third of conspiracy to print and distribute seditious publications. \nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. \nProsecutors have accused Lai of using his tabloid to instigate Western sanctions and incite public hatred towards mainland Chinese and Hong Kong authorities. \nHe also allegedly backed the \"Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong\" international lobbying group to attract anti-China responses from foreign governments with a view to trigger the mainland's economic collapse. \nIn his testimony, Lai at first denied trying to manipulate foreign policies on the mainland and in Hong Kong. \nBut he later acknowledged he had called for sanctions on Beijing and local officials to prevent the passage of Hong Kong's 2020 national security law and to stave off what he saw as an encroachment on the city's fundamental freedoms. \nLai stressed he had ceased all acts that would be deemed illegal under the new law, but decided he could continue expressing his views on current affairs through interviews and newspaper columns. \nProsecutors are expected to spend at least 10 days scrutinising Lai's evidence before his legal team puts the final questions to him in re-examination. \nThe court hears that Lai pulled strings to make the meeting between former Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen and two former US officials - army general Jack Keane and deputy secretary of defence Paul Wolfowitz - happen on August 17, 2017, in Taipei. \nThree days after that, Lai had a separate meeting with Keane and Wolfowitz to discuss Taiwan's military modernisation and the US' possible involvement in that development. \nA summary of the meeting was shared with Antonio Chiang, Tsai's right-hand man. Lai wanted Chiang to pass a message on to Tsai about hiring US retired generals for Taiwan. \n\"Of American generals, some have talents [who] can help modernise the present outdated military outlook [of Taiwan] with the new knowledge they can bring,\" Lai wrote in the summary. \nProsecutor Anthony Chau alleges that what Lai had suggested to Chiang was in effect advice to Tsai for a Taiwanese \"military upgrade\", an accusation Lai denies. \nOn a later occasion, Lai sent Chiang a profile of James Cunningham, a former US consul general in Hong Kong, with the aim of helping Taiwan connect with those who were \"well-versed\" in the US administration. \nChau says: \"So you helped them to be more efficient?\" \n\"Yes, I can introduce sometext to help,\" Lai replies, adding he did so on Chiang's request. \nThe court is adjourned to Friday afternoon. \nAs the afternoon hearing begins, prosecutor Anthony Chau Tin-hang focuses on the messages exchanged in January 2017 between Lai and Antonio Chiang, the right-hand man of former Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen. \nNot only did Lai suggest Chiang keep the consultancy agreement between Tsai and the two former US officials \"absolutely confidential\", he also asked Chiang \"not to show anyone\" a note he prepared for a coming meeting with John Bolton, at the created_at a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who later became the US national security adviser from 2018 to 2019 under the Trump administration. \nBolton met Lai on January 6, 2017. As the note suggest, Lai said during their meeting that China had been \"belligerent\" over territorial disputes in the South China Sea and issues relating to North Korea, adding US military presence in Taiwan would hurt China the most. \n\"A small Taiwan can be a big leverage for American's pivot in Asia ... It leverages [over] China where it hurts most [and] is also most efficient,\" Lai wrote in a note in preparation for the meeting with Bolton. \nDenying that he had advocated for the US military to station itself in Taiwan, Lai says he had no intention to pass on his views to Tsai by sharing the note with Chiang, because he realised it was a \"sensitive\" topic and that Tsai would be cautious about the issue. \nLai says he asked Chiang to destroy the note, but he himself did not remove it from his phone records, which now appear in court as evidence against him. \nChau says: \"So you don't want people to know you had those views as expressed in the note?\" \n\"Yes, I think this is sensitive,\" Lai replies. \nProsecutors kick-start their cross-examination of Lai's evidence by trying to refute his claim that he has never tried to influence foreign policy in mainland China and Hong Kong. \nAnthony Chau Tin-hang, speaking for the prosecution, highlights Lai's close affiliations with the two former US officials, army general Keane and deputy secretary of defence Wolfowitz. Lai previously described the pair as his friends. \nChau argues the ex-media boss knew all along that Keane \"had the ear of\" then US president Donald Trump, but Lai says he only knew the general \"had meetings with Trump somecreated_ats\". \nLai previously testified he had introduced former Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen to Keane and Wolfowitz to help her better understand the \"sencreated_atnt and thinking\" of the Trump administration after she rose to power in 2016. \nAsked by the prosecutor to elaborate, Lai says he had arranged for the two former US officials to visit Taipei three to four created_ats between 2017 and 2019 and, unbeknown to Tsai, had paid Keane for his service. \nMr Justice Alex Lee Wan-tang asks why it was Lai and not the Taiwanese government to settle the bill. Lai explains the meetings between Tsai and the former US officials were initiated by him. \n\"[Keane] was giving advice to President Tsai. It was my arrangement,\" Lai says. \"She was my friend and she asked me for help, but Tsai didn't know that I had to pay for him.\" \nThe 26 days of verbal testimony covered a wide range of topics, with Lai lifting the lid on the vast overseas network he had developed over the years. \nThe Apple Daily founder said he had befriended former Taiwanese leader Tsai, ex-Hong Kong governor Chris Patten and numerous powerful political figures in Washington, including ex-general Keane and former deputy defence secretary Wolfowitz. \nHe said Tsai, who led the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, had inquired about his \"general opinion\" on various matters after she became president of Taiwan in 2016. \nLai told the court he had introduced Tsai to two former American officials to help familiarise her with the \"sencreated_atnt and thinking\" of the United States government. \nHe also said he \"must have discussed\" sanctions with then US secretary of state Mike Pompeo during top-level discussions at the White House in July 2019. \nThe evidence also suggested that Lai's words carried significant weight among American officials at the created_at, with his characterisation of US-China tensions being a \"war of values\" reportedly included in an international human rights report compiled by the US Department of State in August 2020. \nLai initially appeared reluctant to admit ever calling for sanctions from the West, as he denied asking Apple Daily to publish stories in support of such measures and accused a publisher turned prosecution witness of fabricating evidence in earlier proceedings. \nThe tabloid founder later conceded he had indeed appealed for sanctions against Beijing and Hong Kong officials in the hope of forcing the mainland government to reconsider imposing the national security law on the city. \nHe stressed he had never advocated for sanctions after such acts were criminalised in June 2020. \nLai said he was initially \"desperate\" for any kind of international support to stop the \"draconian\" national security law. \nBut he maintained he had abandoned his \"fight for freedom\" after the legislation was enacted, as he felt the city was already \"beyond redemption\". \nLai denied indirectly calling for sanctions after the national security law took effect in June 2020 through his words of support for the US and Taiwan, and his criticism of Beijing. \nHe also denied ever inciting public hatred towards central and local authorities, and maintained he could not hate anytext. \nBut the Apple Daily founder did not hide his disaffection with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his testimony, labelling the country's leader as a \"dictator\" and \"Mao Zedong No 2\". \nHe also accused Xi of making the Communist Party of China a threat to world peace. \nLai said that while he had never specifically asked for foreign governments to take hostile actions after the national security law came into force, he still welcomed any kind of \"support\" for Hong Kong. \nThis included the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which paved the way for US sanctions and the cancellation of the city's preferential trade status in the country. \nHe also maintained that the British government had a \"moral responsibility\" to offer Hongkongers a path to citizenship, while suggesting a greater US military presence in Asia-Pacific could lower the risk of Beijing invading Taiwan and help to stabilise the region. \nCopyright (c) 2025.
